0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,a few years later he has been in a mental asylum and has been a successful pianist for the past few,a few of the scenes are pretty much the same as the one where a couple of men are killed
1,i have to wonder how many times you have a movie like these two movies,i have seen a few movies that have made me want to see a lot
1,maybe the film was shot in the same year and it 's the same old time that we,maybe it 's the fact that the movie was made for the sole purpose of the film
1,it 's a very funny movie with,it 's a very funny movie
1,normally i think that this is a very funny film and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good movie,normally i would have liked to see a more talented actress in her early years but this is n't the case with her
1,i have n't seen the movie yet but i do n't know why i have to watch it again,i do n't think that the movie is worth seeing but i think it 's the best of the lot
1,my only complaint is that this is not a movie,my favorite character is the one who is a little too
1,a few years later i have a fondness for this movie,a very interesting movie with a very good cast and a great
1,too often i do not think that this is an interesting idea and it 's a shame that the director did,too many people have to say this is one of the most boring and boring movies i have ever seen
1,the acting is good with some of the best actors in the business,the film has a very strong story line and a nice cast but it
1,i was surprised to see this movie on a,i was n't expecting anything from the movie
1,but the film does not have a lot,but the movie is n't that good
1,it is a shame that it is not available on dvd or vhs release,it 's a shame because i have n't seen the first two movies i 've
1,in the end it 's just a bad movie,in the end it does n't even have to be
1,i have n't seen it since it was made and,i do n't want to spoil it for you
1,so i was n't expecting much from it but i did not have,so i do n't know why this film has been released theatrically
1,faced with the fact that he is the one who is the only person who knows what he is doing and he,faced with a very simple and very very dark story this movie has a very very very very very bad cast
1,this film was so bad it was laughable,this is the kind of film that makes you
1,i have never seen the movie but i do not think that this is one of the,i was surprised to find that it had been released in the us in the us
1,anyone who has seen the film knows that it has a great story and great characters,anyone who does n't have a clue about it and the fact that it was filmed in
1,the story is about the adventures of,the film is a complete mess
1,however the movie is n't a bad one,however i think that the best of the series
1,here is where the film is concerned,here we have the film as a whole
1,and the film has a lot of action,and that was a very good movie
1,no it 's not for everybody,no wonder the story is n't as
1,despite the fact that it has a very good story the acting is very good,despite being a fan of this series i was expecting something more like this
1,sorry i did n't like it,sorry for the fact that this film
1,i have never seen such an amazing film in the past,i think the director and his writer should have done a lot
1,well this is the first of the three films i 've seen and i was surprised that,well this movie was so horrible i could n't even get it out of my mind
1,i do n't think this is why the film is so bad,i was n't expecting much from this movie and the movie is pretty
1,this is a movie about two people,this is a very bad movie
1,when you 're in a movie you 're not really going to get the point of view,when i first heard about this movie the other night on the sundance channel the film was shot
1,this movie is a must see,this is one of the worst movies
1,and i have to say that the acting is very,and the ending is a bit of a disappointment
1,in fact it was a very enjoyable film and it,in the end it is a very satisfying film
1,in the first movie the story is very good and there 's a very good,in this film it is a movie that is so bad it 's funny
1,some people say this film is a masterpiece,some of the scenes are just plain awful
1,the film is a little slow but the acting is excellent,the story is a little weak but the characters and their motivations
1,james caan is the best thing about this movie,james garner plays a young and troubled man who 's
1,i do n't want to spoil it for you but if you 're a fan of the book and do n't have any expectations you 'll,i have n't read the book and i do n't want to spoil the ending but i will say that the movie is very good
1,or maybe it 's the fact that the film has been a long time,or maybe it is a good idea for a good film to make
1,this is a very funny film,this is a very bad movie
1,edison and his friends have the same problem and they do,edison is a great character actor who is very funny
1,but the movie has no substance whatsoever,but i think that this is a great
1,here we have a film that will,here 's where the film starts
1,what 's the point of this movie,what a wonderful movie it is
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is a bit slow but the story is
1,one of the best films i have ever seen and,one of the worst films of the past decade
1,why did i watch this movie,why do they make a movie that
1,this movie is so awful it 's funny,this is one of those rare films that is
1,this is a movie that i would,this movie is a complete mess
1,michael dudikoff was a bit of an,michael dudikoff is a great actor
1,during the course of the movie the viewer is given the feeling that they are not going to be in the movie,during his first viewing he is a young woman who has to cope with her and the other is that the woman in
1,most of the time the film is a bit slow but the,most of the movie is shot in a very small budget
1,the film is not a comedy or a drama or a drama,the movie is not a complete waste of time and money and time
1,it 's a shame because i have n't seen the movie,it 's not a great movie it was a very enjoyable film
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt but,and it was a very good idea
1,in this film he 's a good guy but he is not the only character who can,in a sense this is one of those movies i have seen in a long time
1,it 's a very funny movie and,it 's just a bad movie
1,there is a lot of good things going on here but it 's not enough,there 's a lot of action and a lot of action in the film
1,a very enjoyable film that should be,a very interesting and entertaining movie
1,look for the scene where he tells the police that the murderer is the killer in,look for it chiefly due to the fact that it is a very good movie
1,there 's no reason why the director would be so much of a fan of this film and it 's not the best of the bunch,there 's also the fact that it is a film about a young woman who is being held captive by her husband and is forced to leave
1,instead we get to see a young man dressed as a model of his own,instead it 's an insult to the director 's intelligence that i ca n't believe that
1,there was a lot of action,there 's a lot of action and
1,heck it was a good film,heck i do n't think that the
1,these guys are the only ones who have ever been in a,these are two of the most important things about this film
1,another problem with the film is the fact that it was made in the early 90,another thing i did n't like about this movie are the performances of the actors
1,his character is so annoying that he does n't seem to care for himself,his wife is a man and the mother is the son of a woman
1,crawford is a very strong woman who 's a bit of a jerk,crawford is a great actress but she does n't really have much to work
1,stand out from the other movies,stand alone and make a good movie
1,the acting is pretty good but the story is so,the film is a bit too long and boring
1,and it was n't that bad,and it is not as bad as
1,i have to agree with the comments on how this movie has a lot of problems,i do n't know what to think of the plot but i think it 's a good
1,if you have not seen this film do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time,if you want to see a film about the evils of a man 's struggle and his personal
1,particularly the scene in which the two boys are on the phone and the girls get shot up and the girls are chased by the same guy,particularly when the film was shot on location in a time period where the film was filmed in color and in the background the lighting was very good
1,speaking of which is the most important aspect of this movie,speaking of the story it is a story about the life of
1,now i know it 's the only,now the plot is n't bad
1,people are talking about this movie,people are not going to be able
1,i have seen this movie and i can honestly say it 's the best of the,i have seen it twice now and still have to watch it again and again
1,how did they make a film like this,how did this film manage to get a pg
1,neither the movie nor the acting,neither the characters nor the acting
1,at first glance the movie is n't even bad,at the end of the movie the audience was left
1,the film is very well acted and the acting is excellent,the movie has a very strong story line and some great performances
1,character development is the main reason why the movie is so good,character development and character development is what makes the movie so great
1,in the end it 's not a great movie,in this film the characters are very believable
1,dora has a good job with the woman he loves,dora 's mother and her father are both in the same
1,it is n't even worth mentioning that it,it is the best movie ever made
1,i have seen the first three seasons of season 1 and,i have to admit i did n't like this movie
1,he is a man who is n't afraid to take a trip to a,he is a good actor and he is very good in the role
1,i think that the director should have made the movie a lot more interesting,i have seen this film and have never been able to see it
1,ben affleck is the only one who manages to make this movie watchable,ben stiller is a very good actor but he is n't funny at all
1,in fact i would like to see this movie again,in the meantime he is a man who is trying to
1,despite the fact that the film is a little bit slow it is still a very good movie and it is a very good one,despite being a huge fan of the original series the series has been a favorite of mine since the first episode of the series
1,squabbles and love story is a film about a young man who is a,squabbles is a very strong film and the film has some nice touches
1,the movie is very well acted and is a great movie,the film is not a documentary about the holocaust and its effects
1,the film is a bit slow but it does not make any sense,the movie is a little slow and slow but the ending is very good
1,here he is the only one who seems to be a bit,here 's a list of events that i do n't like
1,joe is the one who 's got the hots for the,joe 's character is so annoying that it becomes annoying
1,which is why this movie was so good,which brings me to the final scene where she
1,in a way i do not want to spoil the film for you,in the end the only thing that makes this movie is the fact that
1,it is n't a good movie to be taken seriously as it is not,it is not a movie to be seen by any other film maker
1,still i do n't think that this,still the acting was pretty good
1,roddenberry 's direction is very good and the,roddenberry 's film is a complete failure
1,still it 's a great movie to watch,still the film was a little bit too slow
1,she is a great actress but she 's not a bad actress,she is a good actress and i think she 's a great actress
1,daughter and daughter are the best thing in this movie and they 're both great,daughter of the dead girl is a film about a young woman who marries a man
1,rescue the president and then the hero and his son,rescue the two men in the film and then they are
1,the film 's main flaw is to have a lot of money and time wasted in the film,the movie is a bit too long for the viewer to understand the plot and the characters
1,have you ever heard of the film,have the writers of this show have a
1,as for the story it 's just too much to be considered,as the movie goes on the plot becomes a bit predictable
1,this was the first film i 've watched with the same character and it was so bad,this film is so bad i almost turned off the television in the middle of it
1,i have seen the movie and it is very good,i have to say that this movie is a total waste
1,unfortunately the story line is n't really that good as it is a little bit of a stretch,unfortunately this is the only film that i can think of that i would like to say
1,movies like this should not be made,movies like this are made in the future
1,but the movie is a little slow,but it 's not that great
1,for me it 's just a movie,for the most part i found it very
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this movie is not worth your money if you are
1,otherwise this film is a total bore,otherwise i would say this is a very
1,i have to say the acting was good the directing and directing was excellent and the writing was great,i do n't think that it 's a good idea to make a film about a man who 's been
1,unfortunately it does n't work for me as,unfortunately it 's not a good movie
1,a few minutes later i was a bit skeptical about it but i did not like this movie,a lot of the movie 's humor is the only thing that makes this film a classic
1,although the film has a very strong story the story is pretty weak the acting is terrible,although the story line is a little thin the characters are not developed in the least
1,from the opening sequence of events and the first one 's the story is very simple and it is a good,from a technical viewpoint it was n't even the first movie i saw the first time i saw this movie
1,hollywood has made a film that has a lot to say,hollywood 's version of this film was a complete flop
1,it 's not the most profound of,it 's not a bad movie
1,yvonne de havilland is the only one who can act and he 's just a good actress but she 's not convincing,yvonne de havilland was great as the mother who is a little too old to be taken seriously and the story is so
1,it 's a shame the rest of the cast did n't have the same skills as the one in the,it 's just that the movie was n't a good idea and it 's not even the good ones
1,i do n't know what to say,i have to say i did n't enjoy
1,roles of the characters are very good and the film is very good,roles like the always dependable glenn ford and a very talented cast of supporting
1,the movie is a little slow paced but it 's a good movie,the acting in the movie is good and the story is very good and
1,i do n't think that the film would have had a good plot,i do n't think that this film is a masterpiece in any way but
1,it 's a very bad movie and i think it is a very low budget movie,it 's a great story about a man trying to survive in the life of his father
1,the acting is good and the story line is very,the film is a very good one to watch
1,of course he is n't afraid to go to the police,of course the film is a lot of fun to watch and
1,saffron massey is a very talented actor and he plays the role,saffron burrows is one of the best characters in the world
1,i'm not saying that the acting was horrible,i'm not sure what to expect from this movie
1,the film is a very funny and very funny film,the movie is about as much of a joke as it
1,marines and the marines are the ones who are the only people who can be,marines and gentlemen are not the only ones that can survive in this movie
1,it was a good idea to get a few laughs,it is not a film that is so much more than
1,brown was the only actor who had any talent and he was very convincing in this movie,brown and the other two are a pair of friends who are not afraid of the danger they
1,he 's a great actor and a good actor,he is the best actor in the film and he
1,in this film he 's not a bad guy,in the end he 's a good guy
1,in fact i think the director was trying to get the audience to believe,in the first film we get to see him in a different light
1,horrid acting bad acting and even worse acting,horrid dialogue bad acting bad dialogue bad acting
1,most of it 's characters are so boring that you can only imagine that the,most of the film is spent on a few moments of violence and violence
1,as the film goes on the movie becomes very predictable,as a result the movie is just a waste of time
1,he was the only actor who could have been more effective,he is the one who gets to the bottom of the mystery
1,wow this movie is n't bad,wow i do n't know what the
1,this is not the case with the movie but because of the way it,this film is a very good film and a good one to watch
1,fiance and son are the only two reasons why this is not a very good movie,fiance and son have been married to a man who has lost her husband and is married
1,i was n't impressed with this one at all but it,i was n't impressed with the story and the characters
1,in a nutshell the film 's title refers to a number of other movies,in this case the film has an interesting premise and a great cast
1,hence the movie is a little slow,hence that the film is not a complete
1,the acting is very good and the story is pretty good,the movie is about two people who have a relationship with each
1,for the record it is a very good film with a,for the most part i was impressed with the ending
1,the film is a very good movie that is not just about the subject of the events of the world and the,the movie is a bit slow and the ending feels tacked on but it is still a good and enjoyable thriller
1,the acting is pretty bad but the story is n't bad,the film is about the same as the one that made the
1,i do n't think this movie is a masterpiece of art or entertainment,i was n't impressed by the fact that i was watching this film
1,so i have seen a lot of bad,so i was n't expecting anything more
1,this is one of the most beautiful movies i 've ever seen,this movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
1,this is a film that i would watch for the little girl in,this movie is one of the worst films i have ever seen
1,this is the best of them all,this was the best of all the blackadder
1,however the story is very simple and the characters are so well developed,however it does n't matter that it 's just a bunch of people
1,he was the only one who could n't possibly be the killer,he 's a very talented man who 's a good actor
1,vulnerable and funny and the movie is a perfect example of,vulnerable to her husband 's daughter and the other tenants
1,save yourself a few bucks and see this,save yourself money and rent something else
1,director michael winner has a good idea to show the real world of the characters and the characters,director robert zemeckis and his wife david were a master of the medium but the film is not as
1,it is the story of a young woman who is,it is a great show for the whole family
1,it 's not even worth mentioning that the,it 's not a movie for kids
1,if you are a diehard fan of horror films this movie is a must see for,if it had a few more laughs and more action and some really good action
1,the movie is a complete mess and it is n't even a,the acting was terrible but the story is just so stupid
1,it is a very good film and i would recommend it to anyone who loves the,it 's the kind of movie that you would n't expect to see on tv
1,actually i have n't seen the movie yet,actually it 's the kind of movie that makes
1,sorry to say i was disappointed but i was surprised by the fact that the film is a little too short,sorry for a little girl who has n't done a lot of movies but this one was n't that bad
1,two years earlier he 's in his late 20s and early 20s and,two men in the movie have the same problem with their lives
1,mccallum 's character is a bit too much for the character and the,mccallum is a very good actor and he 's a great actor
1,while the movie was n't the most realistic movie i have seen in the last decade it was a complete disappointment,while i do n't like the fact that the director is so obsessed with the story that the movie is n't a
1,eye candy is a very funny movie,eye candy is the first film i have
1,not that it 's not that bad but i have to,not to mention that the plot is a bit thin
1,all in all a very enjoyable film,all i can say is this is a
1,what 's the point of this movie,what is this about the movie
1,talk about a man who 's a man and an expert,talk about a woman who is trying to find the woman who
1,but the real reason why the film was made is a mystery,but the film 's plot is a bit thin and it 's not
1,thanks to a cast of talented actors who play the,thanks to that this film is n't for everyone
1,a lot of the film was made for the sake of the film,a few of them do n't have to worry to be in the movie
1,i think the film 's best asset is the presence of a young man who is,i have never seen a movie that has a single redeeming feature of the movie
1,joe don baker was the best in his career as a man who was able to commit a crime,joe don baker is the perfect actor to play the character he played and he is also a very likable
1,those who do n't like this film should be ashamed of themselves for their actions,those who think that it is not that good is the only thing that can be
1,now i have n't been in a state of shock,now this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,a lot of people are killed and there is a lot of people,a lot of the film is shot in a very small town
1,this is a great movie to see and i recommend it to everyone,this is the first time you 'll ever see the film and it will
1,and i do n't think it would have been so bad,and i do n't think it was a good movie
1,a very good film with a very good cast,a few years back the movie is still very good
1,guarding the film 's premise of this film,guarding it is a very funny movie
1,personally i think the film was shot on location in the early 1800 's and early 90 's,personally i think that it 's a good movie and a good movie to watch if you are a
1,the movie is a complete mess and the only thing,the film is a complete mess of a film
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's not the best,it 's not a movie that is a waste of time
1,a very good film with some very good actors,a few of the actors were good but they were
1,i was n't impressed when i saw the film and was,i do n't think that it was meant to be
1,being a big fan of the original i found it difficult to believe the movie was,being a fan of the genre i was impressed with the story and the acting
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but the,the film is very good but it is not
1,eytan stewart was a good guy but he was a bit too old for this role,eytan fox 's score is excellent as the film 's score of the picture is also excellent
1,the film was shot in black and white and was shot in a very,the movie is very slow and the plot is very thin and boring
1,banderas is the most talented character in this film and he 's a fine,banderas is a fine actor but his character does n't seem very interesting
1,meanwhile the movie is set in the present day and it does have a very very,meanwhile a group of people find themselves trapped in a small village of the dead
1,being a big fan of the original series i was expecting to see more of the,being the first to die i was able to see the end of this film
1,the film is a bit too long and the characters are too shallow to be interesting,the film was shot on location in a very dark way that the movie is shot in
1,for a film about a man who was murdered by the man he met and loved his son,for me the only thing that i can say about this movie is that it has a good cast
1,but i have seen this film and i,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,it is the story of a young boy named seita,it 's a great story and a great cast
1,lets face it the acting is terrible,lets just say that the movie was a
1,i think it 's one of the best movies i have ever seen,i do n't know how to make a movie about the evils of war
1,first of all i have n't seen the original,first of all it 's not that good
1,she is a great actor but she is so annoying that she is just so bad that it 's hard to,she is a great actress and a great actress and she has done a great job of portraying a woman
1,the acting is pretty good and the plot,the movie has a very nice cast
1,rory 's character was not believable but,rory is a very good actor
1,there 's nothing wrong with that and it 's not even worth the,there 's a very good reason for the film to get better
1,prisoner of thieves is a movie about a young girl who is attracted,prisoner is a very interesting film and a good film to watch
1,partly the movie is a complete waste of time,partly because of its poor acting and the lack of
1,while the story line is not a little farfetched there 's also a good deal of suspense and,while this is a good movie i do n't think it is the fault of the movie
1,that 's the best part of this movie,that 's why the movie is so good
1,compared to other movies i have seen this one is the most boring,compared to other films of the same era this is the first one to
1,there is no real story to this movie,there is also a scene where the two main
1,but i do n't think that the film is a total waste,but i have to say that it is not that bad
1,also the movie was very funny and i think the director should be applauded for,also the film is a very funny movie that i would like to see
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful,the movie was a complete waste of time
1,basically this is a film that is n't even,basically the story is n't a bad one
1,this movie is a must see for anyone looking for a good movie,this movie was made in the early 90 's and it is not even
1,beyond the script the acting is pretty good,beyond that i would have to be a bit
1,watching this movie is a real treat to watch,watching it i was surprised to find that it was
1,really it 's not a bad film,really the movie has no plot
1,it 's just a bad movie and i do n't even think that the actors were trying to make a good movie and the acting was terrible,it 's a shame because the story was so bad that i had wasted time on it i was so bored i could not get enough of the
1,you have to be a big fan of the genre,you 'll have a lot of fun watching this
1,this is a great movie and i think it was a great movie,this film is so bad that it 's almost impossible to make a good
1,some of the scenes are very good,some of the scenes in this movie are
1,for the first hour i was really impressed,for the most part this movie is a total
1,now that i have read the book i am a fan of the original,now i know that i have n't seen it since i first saw this movie
1,but it is a good movie,but the real reason for this is
1,it is a very good movie,it 's a pity that this movie
1,death bed is one of the worst movies i have seen,death race was a great movie that i would recommend
1,from the very start of the movie the movie was a little too long,from the first few seconds of the film i was wondering what the hell is
1,this is one of the worst movies ever,this film is a great example of how a
1,if you are looking for an intelligent film with the usual clichs and a good plot you 'll be,if the director was not so much a little more than a few minutes i 'd have left
1,all the actors are excellent and the movie is a perfect example of how a movie should,all in all it 's a good movie but it does n't make a good film
1,what i did like was the acting of the two main characters and,what 's more i can say that this was a great film
1,the movie was shot in black and white and the actors were n't very convincing,the film is about a group of four men in a small midwestern village who is
1,interesting to see a young girl who has a crush on her own and is a very human character,interesting to say the least but the movie does n't really have a lot to do in the end
1,be prepared to be disappointed by the film 's message,be warned that the film is not a comedy but it
1,in fact the only good part is the scene with,in the end the film is a complete failure
1,kinda a good film and a good movie,kinda like the first movie i have seen this
1,for me the film is a very enjoyable experience,for the rest of the movie it is not a
1,then i saw a few episodes of this movie that i thought were the worst,then the two men are killed in a car crash which leads to a robbery
1,if you 're looking for an action film that is a bit over the top then you 'll love this,if you 're not into the whole thing you 're not missing something but this is a good one
1,the film is about a group of young adults who go to the woods to find a job in a,the movie was a bit too long and the ending was n't really worth the trouble with the movie
1,however it is not a movie,however it is n't that bad
1,if it 's not so much a little bit of a mystery i think that 's the point,if you want to watch a movie with a little bit of action and a plot this one 's
1,we are left with an interesting story of the hardships of,we are not talking about the movie or the characters
1,the movie was n't so bad it,the film is very well done
1,the film is a complete mess of the original and it 's not even the good,the movie is not as bad as it is and it is the worst film ever made
1,raveena is a good actor and i think that his acting in this film is very good,raveena 's character is a caricature of a young woman who is not only the mother of the
1,the movie is a little slow but the plot is so simple,the movie is about a bunch of people who go to the woods
1,how can you not be so stupid,how could this be a great film
1,and i do n't want to spoil anything,and the film is not about anything but a
1,also the film is not about a man who,also the ending is a little too abrupt
1,there are some funny scenes in the film,there 's no need of a plot or character
1,considering that the film is a bit slow it is a very entertaining film,considering this is a low budget film it 's a very good film
1,unfortunately the story line is n't that great,unfortunately this film is a complete mess
1,that 's the best part of this movie,that is a shame because this movie is n't
1,so the movie has a very interesting plot and,so what 's the deal with the story
1,an excellent film that i enjoyed watching and a lot of the time,an example of how a film can be found in the usa
1,ace ventura is a great actor and he is perfect as the villain,ace of the devil is a very good movie with a great deal of
1,most of the time the film is set in the present day and it 's not the type of movie,most of the film takes place in the same time as the first one and then the story unfolds
1,sigh i have to say that the acting is pretty good and,sigh i do n't know why this movie is so bad
1,present the film 's story is a simple one,present the movie is a very good film and i
1,of course he is the one who has to be a little more,of course it 's not a bad film but it 's not
1,in this movie the characters are not very likable,in fact this movie was so bad it 's almost
1,i have seen a lot of movies and have been a,i was expecting a movie that was n't even good
1,picture was a good movie but it was n't,picture of a woman who is married to a woman
1,as the story continues to unravel the story begins to unravel,as for the acting it was a waste of my time and
1,i have to admit i did n't like it,i do n't think it was a great movie
1,rory is the only person who can get a job in the first place,rory is an old man in the world of a new york family in the
1,in the end it is a movie that you should not watch,in the end i was n't sure whether the film was going to
1,through the film the viewer is left feeling cheated by the film and the characters,through the movie we are treated to a very dark and haunting look at the life
1,so i have to admit that i was n't disappointed by this film,so the movie is not about the war or the history of war
1,however the film is a complete failure,however the film is not a comedy it
1,rated r for violence and sexual situations and a,rated r for strong violence and strong language
1,the film is a very good film,the film is a little slow and boring
1,the story is about a bunch of people who have a relationship and are not a married couple,the film was very well made and i think it is a very good family drama with some of
1,technically it is a good film and a very,technically the film has a very good cast
1,dick tracy is a good actor but he 's a bit of a,dick tracy is the perfect choice for the role of the president
1,the film is a bit of a mess but the story is so interesting,the film was shot in a very small budget and was very good
1,well i guess it 's a movie that i can watch over and over again,well i have a lot of fun watching this movie and i really liked it
1,the film has a very good plot and the characters are likable,the acting was good the story is good the acting superb
1,all in all it is a very funny and enjoyable film,all of the characters are likable and the plot is very well
1,this is a movie that is not only a very bad,this is a very good movie and a must see
1,i think this movie was a huge mistake,i have never seen a film that was worse
1,there are many scenes where you can see the actors playing the characters in the movie,there is a scene where a man is walking through the woods with a woman and then
1,books are always a pleasure to watch and the story,books have been done and done in many cases
1,almost every scene is a dream,almost every scene has a very long
1,perhaps the most important thing in this film is how much it does n't have the same impact,perhaps it was because the director was so busy in the making of the film that i felt cheated
1,i do not think that this film is the best of the bunch and it 's a,i do n't think that the movie was made for the sake of a good movie
1,however the movie is a little slow and,however it was a very good show
1,lancaster is the best actor of the film and the film is not very well written,lancaster plays a very likable character who 's been given a chance to make the film
1,the acting is horrible the plot is bad,the film is a bit slow moving but the
1,it 's just a shame that this movie has n't been released theatrically in theaters but i do n't,it is the best of the three films of the year and it 's a joy to watch
1,i was n't really sure whether it was the director or the director 's intention but it was n't that good,i have to wonder if it was the director 's fault that the film was shot in a different way
1,those who are not familiar in the history of the war and,those who do not like this film will love this one
1,i was expecting a lot from this movie but i was n't disappointed,i think that this was a great film for the whole family it was
1,stan and ollie are the best characters in this movie,stan laurel and ollie are a very good pair
1,you 'll be surprised at the end,you can see the director 's talent and
1,in the meantime the movie is set in a very small town,in the meantime he is a very young man who is not a
1,like a lot of the movies i have seen this one is a bit of a letdown,like the other reviewer who said it was the greatest of the bunch of the film it 's
1,the film is not about as bad as the first one but the rest is just a mess,the acting is very good and the plot is a lot better than the first one but the acting
1,the film 's plot revolves around the adventures of the two sisters and,the film is very good and the story is very well developed
1,the acting is horrible and the plot,the film is a complete mess
1,he is a very good actor,he is not a bad guy but
1,every character in the movie was a stereotype,every time he opened the door he said the
1,he is the best of all the characters in the movie,he is not a great actor but he 's very good in
1,not only is it so bad it 's good,not only is the plot of this film is a
1,otherwise i 'd recommend this film to all fans of horror and fans,otherwise i think the film has been a success in the past
1,tyrone russell is great as the lead,tyrone power 's performance is a bit wooden
1,the story is a little weak,the film was made by a group
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is a bit slow,the film is a little too long for the plot and the acting
1,i have seen this film several times,i do agree with the other comment that
1,so the movie has a good deal of humor but the movie is n't funny,so what do you expect to see a movie about an alcoholic who is so obsessed
1,maybe the movie is just a bunch of kids,maybe it 's the same thing but it 's not
1,it 's not even a good movie,it is a shame to see this movie
1,i do n't know if it 's,i was expecting a good film
1,several of the scenes are so stupid that it 's hard to see why the film would n't have,several of the scenes were shot in the same way and it 's not a very good film
1,the film is a very good film that is n't afraid to be a good,the acting in this film was very good and the plot line was great
1,if i was n't that i 'd probably have to say i 'd rather watch this movie again,if you 're looking for a good movie with a strong plot and great actors this movie is not
1,do yourself a favor and rent the original,do n't be fooled by the cover
1,here 's the breakdown the movie was made in the us and was,here is a very sad story and the story is very interesting
1,therefore the film is a bit too long for the first,therefore i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,but i have to admit that i was very impressed by the fact that it was a complete,but it 's a good movie and i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a film
1,i have n't read any of the other reviews here,i think that it is one of the best films i
1,the film is about a group of young people living in a small apartment in new york,the film is about a group of young people who are trapped in a small town and spend
1,that was n't the case in the movie but,that was the best thing about the film
1,this is one of the most underrated movies ever made,this is the kind of film that is so bad that
1,admittedly the film is a little too long for its own good,admittedly the film is a little too long and it 's not worth
1,every time she is on screen she does not even get a clue about the story,every time i see it i will say that i am so disgusted that i could have
1,but i do n't have a problem with the story,but it does not have the same impact of the original
1,then again what does this have to do with the rest of the movie,then there 's the scene where the girl is trying to kill him
1,i have seen this movie several times in the past 25 years,i was surprised by the fact that this movie was made in the
1,no wonder that this movie is n't,no one has to endure this
1,ana is a very good actress,ana is a great actress but she
1,although i do n't know how to make it a bad movie it 's a waste of my time,although the movie is not as good as the first one it was a bit too long and the plot
1,i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny,i think the director should have had a bigger budget and he could have done
1,ca n't be more wrong than this,ca n't believe it 's a film or
1,in fact it 's not a good movie and it does have a good deal of suspense,in the end it 's not a movie to be taken seriously but you can do a good
1,then the movie switches into a story and it is a bit of a stretch for a movie,then there 's the fact that this is a very funny film with a lot of good acting
1,do n't worry to the contrary that you 'll have a hard time finding it,do n't get me wrong i love the show and it 's a great movie
1,not only did he not get his hands on the set but the story was pretty good,not only does he not have to be in his position for a few seconds and he is
1,the movie is a very good film that is n't just about,the acting was n't bad but it was n't that good
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first film,the movie is not about the evils of the human condition
1,it 's a pity that this film did n't have the same,it was a very interesting film and it was very enjoyable

1,i have to say that this was one of the most underrated movies of all,i was n't sure if it was a good movie or a bad one
1,it is n't even a good movie but it 's not as bad as some,it 's a pity that the movie is n't as good as the original
1,though this is a great movie it is a great film,though it does n't matter that the film is a little bit
1,he 's the only actor who can save this movie from being,he is the most beautiful and beautiful woman of the world
1,even the acting is terrible the directing awful and the plot is so lame,even though the film is n't a masterpiece the film is very well acted and
1,it 's not a bad film,it was a very good movie
1,a few minutes later the film takes place at the end,a lot of people have said that i have n't seen the
1,some of the actors are n't good and the movie is just too bad,some of the scenes are very funny and i laughed so hard that i laughed
1,and that is what i thought was the best of the two films,and the acting is pretty good with the exception of a good actor
1,it was a great movie to see,it is the best movie ever
1,hoffman 's acting is so bad that it is almost comical to watch,hoffman is a great director and the film is a great example of how
1,i was n't expecting anything from this film,i do n't think that this film would be
1,to be fair i did n't know what to expect but i was surprised by the film 's end,to be honest i did n't think this was a movie that was so bad that it was n't even
1,i do n't want to give away the ending,i was surprised at how bad it was
1,why did n't they just kill the president,why do they make such a bad movie like
1,if you are looking for a movie that is a little bit of,if you 're a fan of the original you should see it
1,the movie is about the power of war and it 's a lot of,the acting was n't as good as the other actors in this film
1,and the film is a little too long,and it 's not a movie that 's not
1,gus 's evaluation is a very good movie,gus 's evaluation is a very good movie and
1,i do n't know if i can get it out of the way,i was surprised that i did not see this movie on tv

1,there are many other examples that i have seen in,there 's a lot of action to be found
1,whilst the story is not the best of the two films the acting is superb,whilst this is a great film it is still very enjoyable and very funny at times
1,but i do n't know what the,but this is a great movie
1,most of the actors in this film were very bad,most of the time the film is not a complete waste
1,i do n't think that a movie,i was surprised by the ending
1,wtf is the story of a young woman named angela who is a little girl and she is the,wtf is the fact that the story was so predictable that the movie could n't have been made
1,however this was a great story and i think it would have been better if they were n't,however the movie is n't as bad as some of the other movies i have seen but i have
1,i was expecting the worst movie i,i was n't expecting anything else
1,she is a very attractive woman and a,she 's just a little bit annoying
1,but i do n't think that it 's a real movie,but the story is so bad that it 's impossible to follow
1,much of the movie takes place in a small town,much of the movie is spent in the movie
1,the film is very well acted and directed and it has a lot of great moments,the acting is pretty good and the story line is very good and the acting is good
1,actually i think it was a great movie,actually i was impressed to find out that this
1,if you want to make a good movie out of it it 's not,if it was n't for the fact that it was made for the sole reason
1,the film is about the power of the characters the characters the relationships and the way they are,the movie is not a good idea to be taken seriously but the film is very entertaining
1,instead of a movie that is a complete waste of time and money,instead we are treated a very poorly written poorly acted and acted story
1,i was expecting this movie to be a great movie to watch,i have n't seen this movie since i first read it on the

1,the story is a little thin but the story,the acting was n't bad but not bad
1,this movie was so bad that it made me angry,this is a movie about a woman named seita and his
1,it is not even a movie,it 's a shame that the movie
1,there was no need to be a hero,there 's a scene where a woman is walking
1,if you have n't read this book you will find yourself asking why did,if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll enjoy this one
1,and i have to mention the scene,and it 's not even funny

1,the film is a very funny and very funny movie with a very good message,the movie is about a young girl named caroline who is a teenager in a mental
1,no one is going to have any idea what to do with,no wonder the film is not a masterpiece of its own
1,harry and arthur 's relationship with each other is also quite touching and the story is a good,harry is a great actor but he is not the only actor that i can identify with
1,the story is simple and the characters are very interesting,the film is a little slow paced but a little too
1,try to find the real story of this film,try to be funny but it is n't
1,some of the scenes are so bad that it 's funny,some of the scenes where they are trying to make you feel
1,could n't they have been so much more,could they have done the right thing
1,now i have seen the movie and,now i know what i did
1,holmes is a good guy who is a little over the top but his role is a bit too much to ask,holmes and his men are in the same predicament as the first movie and the second one is pretty good with the exception

1,it 's a shame that it is n't available on dvd,it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but it
1,basically it 's the kind of movie you 'd like to see in an early 80 's and early 80,basically the film 's plot is n't as good as the book but it 's not a bad thing
1,that 's the only reason why this movie is not,that was the most ridiculous aspect in the movie
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who are sent into the desert to find the missing treasure and have to deal,the movie is a very funny and funny film about a group of people who go on a trip to the country
1,a very interesting story and some great action sequences are done in a very realistic and realistic manner,a good example of the kind of film that i think is the first one in a long time
1,powell 's performance in this film is a bit too much for him to play,powell is an interesting character but his character does n't even have the decency to make
1,however the movie has a lot of good points,however the movie is a bit too slow for the
1,you can see that this film is a,you know it 's a bad movie
1,my only regret is that i was n't impressed by this,my advice is that it 's not worth a rental
1,i do n't know why i watched,i was expecting a good movie
1,the film is a very funny and funny,the movie is not a bad film
1,it 's not a bad film,it 's a shame because i was

1,i do n't know why the movie was made,i think the movie is just too bad to be
1,i do n't know why this film was made,i do n't think that the film is worth seeing

1,and i was n't impressed by the film because i was a bit surprised,and it 's the best movie i have ever seen in my life
1,i have never seen such a bad movie in my life,i do n't think this film was made in the us but
1,i have seen a lot of movies and i can see why this movie was so awful,i do n't understand why they did not have to be the only ones who were in the
1,so the film is a bit too much for a,so i guess the movie was n't that good
1,well the first time i saw it i was so impressed with it,well i guess that 's the only way to get this movie
1,go see this movie and you 'll,go ahead and watch the movie
1,you can see this movie in a theater where,you can see the director mateo 's character
1,she has the best acting job of her career,she 's a little bit too old for a movie
1,maybe it is the fact that the movie has a few,maybe the film is n't a complete waste of time
1,dave and his friends and friends are a bit too much for,dave 's character is a little too much for the role
1,this was a great film for a long time and i would recommend it to anyone who,this film is a very good film with the usual cast of actors and the director
1,and the film is a little slow at times,and the film 's climax is very abrupt
1,however i do n't think that this movie,however the film is a complete mess
1,miguel is the only person who can be blamed for a long long,miguel 's character was so bad i wanted to see him die
1,i do not recommend this movie to any of you,i have n't seen the original series but i was expecting
1,but the movie is n't as good as the first one,but i think it 's one of the best films of the
1,but i think the film is n't as bad as some of the other reviews,but i think this movie has the potential to be a classic and it 's not
1,the movie is very funny in its ineptitude,the story is about a group of friends who
1,the film is a bit of a mess,the film is a little slow at times and
1,the acting was horrible the story was bad and the characters just seemed stupid,the film is not about a man who has a dream of being in the
1,the acting is good the story is great,the film was a little too long
1,the movie is a very interesting and very funny film,the acting is good the plot is a bit too thin
1,and that 's why the story is so,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,the movie is about a young man who,the movie starts out as a comedy
1,unlike the original film the story of the movie is,unlike the first movie this is a good film
1,its a shame that the movie was n't released on video in the us,its the kind of film where the director is a little prejudiced and he is
1,sometimes i do n't know where to go and why i do n't know the plot of the film,sometimes i think it 's a little too much to be a fan of the genre but i do n't
1,the movie is about a young woman who has a,the movie is a bit too long for me
1,it is a very good movie and it 's not the only film that,it is a movie that is not only a comedy but a film
1,overall this is a very good film,overall this movie is a must see for
1,this movie is so awful it 's hard to believe that this,this film is a very bad attempt at a horror film
1,wow this was a good movie and a good film,wow the movie was a little bit too long
1,kevin bacon is the best of all,kevin spacey is the only reason to watch
1,e is a great show and it is a shame that this show is canceled,e the acting was terrible the story was bad the story was stupid and the ending
1,trendy and a lot of people are n't going to see this film,trendy and the film does a fine job of showing the real life of
1,but the real thing that is so great is that it 's,but i do n't think that the movie was really good
1,see it for yourself and enjoy it,see a movie with the same name
1,although it 's not a good film it is not a bad film,although the film is a bit slow the story is very slow
1,although i was expecting the same to be a great movie and i was expecting a lot of it i,although it was a bit too long and the story was very weak it was a bit too predictable
1,fierstein and the rest of the cast are all fine,fierstein and his wife are both in the film
1,as the movie opens the plot is a little weak,as i said earlier this movie was n't a bad movie
1,fred williamson 's performance is the only thing that i can say about the film that i liked,fred macmurray is excellent as the young christy and he 's not just a bad guy he 's a
1,if you have n't seen this movie you should definitely check it out,if you want to watch a good movie you should check it out
1,only the acting and writing are terrible,only one thing about this movie i liked
1,i'm not saying that i am a fan of the original and i 've seen,i'm a huge fan of the first two films i have seen this one
1,i'm glad i saw it in the theatre,i'm not going to go into the movie as
1,just as you would expect it to,just a little over the top
1,arn is a very good movie,arn is the only character who is
1,instead of the usual hollywood fare it 's just a cheap mess that is n't funny,instead of being a good guy it is a very funny film that is a real treat
1,if you want a good laugh and laugh out loud funny this,if you have n't seen this movie i highly recommend it
1,i do n't know what the appeal of it was,i do n't think that the movie is so bad it
1,having said that this movie is a complete bore,having seen the original series i was very impressed by
1,this is a very good film and it 's a shame that the film is still unavailable on,this was a good film and it was a lot better than i thought it would be
1,the film is not about the evils of a good or bad guy or,the film has an odd premise that is n't even worth a watch
1,there are some good performances and the movie is a little,there are some good scenes and the acting is good
1,in the end it 's a good idea,in fact i was impressed at the end of
1,directed by a great director and a cast that includes the likes of david cronenberg and john cassavetes,directed by the director of the original film the story is a little too much for it 's time
1,the film is very well done,the movie starts out very promising but
1,even though it was a little bit of a parody it was a little slow and it was,even though i was n't a fan of the first film i thought it was very funny
1,a lot of people are raving about this film,a few minutes later we get a glimpse into the
1,he 's a great actor and a good actor,he is also the most annoying person in the world
1,i do n't know how it got to the end but,i have seen a lot of movies in my time
1,sort of like the first film,sort of like the movie itself is
1,as the film goes on it is all about the family 's,as a result the movie is a bit long and boring

1,but the film is a little slow at times,but this is the only one of those movies that
1,originally i was n't expecting a lot more of it,originally a remake of the book is not a faithful adaptation
1,and the acting is pretty good for a movie like this that i 've always liked,and the acting is pretty good and the plot is so predictable and so stupid
1,there are a few good points to this flick,there 's a scene where a man who is a
1,orlando garofalo is a good actress,orlando advani is a great actor but
1,from the opening scene where the hero 's character is revealed to be a woman and a woman who is a little more than a little more interesting,from the first scene where a man 's wife is raped by a car accident the film is a bit slow and the story is n't very good either
1,bad acting bad plot bad acting bad script,bad movie bad movie bad bad bad
1,while the story was interesting the story was pretty weak,while the story was not as good as the novel the
1,there are a number of scenes which are so bad they could n't have saved this movie,there 's a lot of action in this movie and it is a shame to see a sequel

1,meanwhile a woman who is in a wheelchair has to,meanwhile there are some interesting moments in the movie
1,the acting is very good and the story is very good,the story is about a young woman who moves into the house
1,i do n't know why i did n't,i have n't seen the first one
1,interestingly it is a movie that is not only for the,interestingly enough it 's all so bad it 's good
1,in fact the whole movie is a complete mess,in fact it was n't a good film
1,however i have to agree with the reviewer,however the movie is n't that bad
1,it is a very good movie and it 's not the only one that has been made,it 's a shame that the producers decided to make the sequel to a sequel so i ca
1,the film is a little too long,the movie is a very good film that
1,there is a lot of good stuff here,there is a lot of action in the story
1,she is a very good actress and she 's not only good,she was so beautiful and beautiful and she was so cute
1,i have never seen the first two,i was surprised by this film
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is not for everyone but
1,none of the characters are likable enough,none of them are very good
1,deborah kerr was a great actress,deborah kerr plays an aging young woman
1,overall i think it 's a shame that the movie is,overall this movie is a waste of time and money
1,the movie was shot in a very grainy and edited way that,the movie starts off well and the ending is pretty good
1,i think the movie was a bit slow at first but it 's not a movie,i have seen this movie and i have to agree with the others that it 's not
1,how can a film with such a good cast,how many people do you think they can
1,this movie is a waste of time,this is the worst movie i 've ever
1,look at this as a warning to all the people who have seen the movie and i have seen it,look like the film was shot in the woods and the camera work is so poor that the viewer is constantly
1,in a sense that the movie has a very,in the end it 's a good movie
1,this movie has a lot of potential but it is a great,this movie was a complete waste of my time and money
1,since the film is a little over the top in its approach i would have given this film a zero out of ten but the acting and direction were so,since this movie was made in the us and the early seventies and early 70s it was still a lot more than a lot of fun to watch it
1,what 's with the way the story unfolds,what 's worse is that the director and his
1,a lot of the film was shot in a studio studio studio,a few years ago i saw the movie on the big screen with
1,so if you 're a fan of the original you should see it,so i guess it is n't a bad film but it is not
1,a good movie that will make you laugh,a good film for the whole family
1,even the acting was terrible and the plot was just plain stupid,even the most ardent fan of this film should have been conned by
1,as the film goes on the film becomes a bit tedious and drags along with a few,as for me i would have liked it to have had a bit more of it
1,this is not a bad film,this movie is not a bad movie
1,rather the story of the film is a little bit of an insult to the book,rather than a film like the one i 've seen in the past few years it is
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i was surprised that i did n't have
1,not a good movie but a good film,not only was it a very bad film but
1,the film is not about the battle against the nazis,the film is about a man who has been living in
1,the movie is very well done,the film is about a woman and
1,they are not funny at all but it 's a shame they did not,they were n't even good enough to make this one of the best
1,no one has ever seen a good actor in the movie,no matter how many times he was the most annoying character i
1,but the real problem with this film is that it is n't,but i have to say i was n't impressed at all
1,they are not even the ones that are n't so good,they were n't so much in the way of a plot
1,he was a great actor and was a good actor and he,he is a good actor but he does n't do much
1,the movie is a bit too long,the movie is not a bad movie
1,most of the movie is about the people who live in new york,most of the actors are very good and the story is very good
1,based on the novel by john heard a famous author of a novel by the name of the famous nobel prizewinning author david cronenberg is the story of a young,based on the true story of the famous author of the famous novel the story of a young girl named tristan who is a little more than an adult
1,why is the film so popular,why is this movie so good
1,one of the best films that i have ever seen,one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,or is it the fact that this is a movie about a man,or the fact that the movie is a complete waste of time
1,frank sinatra is a good actor but the film is,frank sinatra is a great actor as the lead
1,parallel of the film 's title the film is a very different approach and a very good,parallel to this film 's success it has a lot more to say about the film
1,this is the first time i have seen this movie,this film is a must see for all ages
1,he 's a little too old for the part but he 's not too,he 's a great actor and he 's very good as a villain
1,now i know what i am talking about but i think it 's a great movie,now this movie has been done in a way that i think it is the most important
1,mike myers is a very talented actor,mike tyson was a very talented actor and
1,crumb 's character is the same,crumb is one of the worst films
1,now i know that it is the worst movie i have ever seen,now the story is a little too predictable for a horror movie
1,violence is a bit more interesting than most of the films that have,violence and violence are a few of the scenes of this film
1,it is a very good film,it is not a movie that is
1,when you watch the movie it is a very funny movie with a good story line and great characters,when the movie starts it is a very bad film that is n't worth the effort of a ticket
1,so i do commend you to avoid this one,so i guess the director was trying to make a
1,rarely has i been so impressed by a movie that was a little too much to bear,rarely have you been so afraid of the movie 's plot to make you care what happens to
1,not only was this movie a total mess but it 's not bad,not only is the acting superb and the direction is flawless but this one
1,the film has a lot of action and the acting is pretty good,the film is not about the people who live with each other
1,it 's a very funny film,it is a very interesting movie
1,another thing i liked about this movie was that it had a good cast that i liked the first half,another example is when the two main protagonists are reunited and they have a relationship with the two protagonists
1,the film is a little too much of a downer,the film is very funny and the acting is superb
1,while this is n't exactly the worst movie i have seen it has to do with the,while the film is a bit slow it is not as good as the first one
1,if it 's on a dvd release you 'll probably have to see the film to get it right,if it were n't for the fact that the movie had a lot more to offer it 's still very
1,hilary swank was a good actress and the acting is good,hilary swank 's character is a little too old to be a
1,the movie is a little slow but it 's not that good,the story is about a young boy who works for a family in
1,being a fan of the first two films i was expecting to see a good movie but i did n't have to watch,being a fan of the series and i was impressed with the story and the characters i was impressed by the acting
1,here 's where the film starts dragging off and the film is set in a very dark atmosphere,here he is a man who has a very good time with him and his wife and daughter
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is about a young woman
1,given the choice of the actors and the actors involved in this production it 's hard to imagine why the director,given the fact that the movie was a little too long it 's just a little bit of a stretch
1,i was so excited that i was so bored,i was n't expecting the worst movie i 've ever
1,minnelli 's film is an excellent film,minnelli is also a master of the medium
1,kazan is a great director and this is a very good film,kazan 's film is a film of a man who is a communist
1,i have never seen such an awful movie and i ca,i do n't know what to say about this film
1,diana rigg is perfect as a woman who has to be a little too young to get married and is in love,diana rigg plays her role well and the movie does a nice job of showing the true emotions of her life
1,the film 's main weakness is to have a lot of money spent watching this,the film is not a bad film it 's just a waste of time
1,buuel was a great actor and i hope that he can get his hands on the right side of the,buuel is the master of his own unique vision of the subject matter of the film and his work
1,a few years later i was able to see this film,a lot of people have said that the acting is bad but
1,oh my god it is a good film,oh and the music is so awful that it
1,okay so i do n't think i 've seen a movie like this before,okay so the story is not as bad as the first one but it 's
1,they were so stupid that it made the film unwatchable,they are the best actors in the world and their performances
1,i'm a fan of the genre and this film is a must see,i'm a huge fan of horror movies but i do n't know what the
1,there is a scene with the young man who is a bit of a loser in his face,there is a lot of action in the movie and the whole thing is a little too predictable for
1,in fact the only thing that is good is the music,in a sense the movie was n't a good one
1,the film is a bit too long,the film has a lot of good things
1,now this is one of the most,now that 's a bad thing
1,i do n't know how it 's going to get better but it does n't,i was expecting a lot of the movie but i was n't expecting a lot
1,the film 's plot is about a,the movie is a complete mess

1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this is a movie that i would advise anyone to
1,i have to admit that i am a fan of,i was n't expecting anything more than this movie
1,half the movie was shot in the same place that was in the first film,half the film is about a group of people trying to find a way to get
1,what 's the deal with the rest of us,what i did not like about it at first i
1,it 's just a bunch of random characters that are supposed to be funny and have a very bad ending,it 's a shame that the director did n't get the credit for his screenplay or his own direction
1,approach to the film is the fact that it 's a very bad film,approach to the director is the most important thing i 've ever seen
1,the movie has a few funny lines but the movie is just,the film is very well done and the acting is good
1,but it 's not a bad movie,but the movie was n't bad
1,my friend and i rented it because of the title and it sounded so bad,my favorite part of the movie was the scene where she was trying to make her
1,that 's the only reason to see it,that 's the way it is presented
1,okay so it 's a good movie but i think the movie is a total waste of time and money,okay so the plot is a bit farfetched but the acting is good enough and it 's a shame that the
1,the acting is good the story is,the film has an interesting premise
1,that is why the movie has been made,that was a great idea to make a movie
1,when i first saw it in new york i was shocked to learn that it was a very,when i saw the trailer for it i thought that it might be a little too slow
1,helicopters are the same as the first movie and the second,helicopters are used as an excuse to make a movie
1,otherwise it 's a good film to watch with your buddies,otherwise i 'd rather watch this film than i did
1,sidney poitier is a great actor and he 's not only a great actor,sidney lumet is a genius as the director and writer of this film
1,astonishingly it 's a very good movie and it 's worth watching,astonishingly the story of the film is a bit too familiar with the
1,it 's not a good film and it is a bit slow,it 's not a movie that will appeal to anyone who enjoys a
1,the movie has a very nice soundtrack but the movie is just plain bad,the movie starts with a bunch of guys and their buddies and their friends who
1,the film is about a man named benjamin who is,the film is about the power of the characters
1,the movie has a very good plot and,the acting in the film was excellent
1,sure the movie was a little too slow but i was n't expecting much of it,sure it 's not a good idea to have a movie that does n't have a good
1,the film has an interesting premise but the execution is very weak,the movie is not about the people in the world or the people
1,they are all so bad that you ca n't even laugh,they were n't so bad they were just plain stupid
1,to say it 's not funny is a bad thing because,to make matters worse this film is just plain bad
1,watch it with a bunch of kids,watch it if you are into a good
1,diverting by the director 's name,diverting in the first ten minutes of
1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the acting is horrible and the writing,the film is not a bad movie but it is n't a good movie
1,i was surprised by the fact that,i was surprised by the ending
1,this is a great movie to watch,this movie is not for everyone but if
1,410 for the first half hour,410 i was a little surprised by
1,this movie has been made to be a movie about two young people who live in,this is a great movie and one of the best movies that have ever made
1,such an awful movie that i have to admit to myself that,such an awful film is a waste of time to see
1,in the end i was n't sure how the film could have been so much better but it is n't,in fact the only reason i gave it a 2 is the fact that it is a very good movie
1,if you are a fan of the original you 'll like this,if you 're not a fan of the book i highly recommend this
1,anne heche was excellent as the mother,anne reid is a great actress
1,i was surprised to find that the movie had no redeeming,i do n't know why the movie is so bad
1,near this point the film is about the same thing as the original,near the end the film is a little too much to be considered as
1,a lot of the film is shot in the dark and the story centers around the characters,a very good movie with a great cast and a good story line and a nice cast
1,in the end the movie is not as good as,in the end the movie has no real meaning
1,i was n't impressed at all,i do n't want to ruin it
1,3rd the plot was a little confusing and i could n't believe it,3rd of all the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,griffin dunne is a fine actor but his role is not convincing,griffin dunne was the only one who had a chance to make the
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie is a little too long for its
1,the film is a bit slow but i found it quite entertaining to watch,the acting was n't bad but the acting was n't as bad as some say
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the film is a little too much for its
1,it is the story of two young lovers who live in the,it 's not a movie that is a waste of time
1,the film is very well acted and the acting is,the film has a lot of potential to do
1,lori and ashley 's love for each other is also very good,lori is a very nice woman and the mother of the mother is
1,most of the time the characters were not developed,most of the time the film has a very slow
1,succumbed to the movie 's title it was a little too hard to follow,succumbed to a few of those movies that are not even close to the original
1,norm 's performance was a bit stiff but the film itself was pretty good and i,norm is the only person who can get his own head of his own life
1,despite the fact that the movie is based on a true story i do n't think it was a great movie,despite the fact that it is a film about a group of people who are trapped in a world of the dead
1,it is a very good film and the acting is superb,it 's the same old time that you have a chance to
1,okay i know it 's a good movie,okay so i do n't want to spoil it
1,the movie is a little slow and boring but it 's not a,the film was made for television and it was not a movie
1,maybe he is n't the only character who has a personality that is not only the best actor in the movie,maybe it 's the fact that the film is a little slow but that 's all i could think of
1,yet the movie is a bit of a mess,yet it 's not the best movie ever but it
1,and that was the only reason why i was impressed by,and the acting is so bad that i actually laughed
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the film 's plot is a bit thin and
1,she was a very nice guy and a good actor but her character was so annoying that i did n't care for her character because,she was a great actress and she 's not only a good director but she does n't have to do a lot of things
1,i was n't really sure what to expect from this film,i have seen a lot of films and i 've seen a
1,more like a bad dream film,more than anything else it is a
1,if you want a good film about a man who is not a bad guy then,if i was a fan of the original i would have been a bit surprised
1,finally there is a lot of good stuff,finally there are some scenes of a woman who
1,but this film is a complete waste of time,but i was n't impressed with the film
1,some of the scenes are pretty good and some of the scenes with the,some of the scenes are very well done and the acting was excellent
1,the movie has a few funny parts but,the acting and directing are very poor
1,an example of how to be a good idea,an excellent cast of supporting players including the excellent cast
1,your typical viewer should see a lot of movies that have n't been made,your only problem with the film is that it 's just not the right amount
1,i do n't know how to make a movie that has,i do n't want to ruin the movie for you
1,you have to wonder if they were trying to make something out of the ordinary,you know the drill is a bad movie that 's not even good enough for the
1,in the end it is a very good movie with a very interesting message about life in a way that is not a very interesting,in a movie like this you get a good feeling of what is happening in the film and how it is in the film
1,my favorite character was the one with the girl who was supposed to be gay and the other girls in,my favorite character is the old woman who has been in love with her in a very long time
1,meanwhile a group of young men have been kidnapped by an old man,meanwhile the girl and the woman who are the two roommates are killed
1,or is it a bad film,or even the most ardent fan of
1,throw in a few good actors in this one but you ca n't,throw the two together with their own and the two of them
1,several of them are very funny and the movie is a joy to watch,several of the scenes where she is supposed to be a little too much to
1,the film is a bit too long for me,the film was shot in color and the sets were
1,this movie was a total disappointment,this is a movie for the entire
1,oh and i was n't expecting much,oh my god this movie sucks
1,there are so many good things to say,there is nothing wrong with this film
1,now i do n't know how it 's going to be funny,now i am going to be a fan of this series
1,by now we have a bunch of people who are in the same apartment as their lives in the same way,by all means the most memorable scene in the film was a scene where the woman is talking to a woman
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring,the film is a very good movie that will
1,i have seen this movie twice now and it 's still pretty good,i have n't seen the movie but the film was very entertaining
1,one of my favourite parts is the scene where the girl is trying to get her son to sleep with a girl and then,one of the most interesting things about this movie is that it is not just a story it is a very moving movie
1,will smith is the only one who is the one who is,will smith 's performance as the lead actor is so good
1,tomorrow the movie is about a group that,tomorrow is the best film ever made
1,then again it 's not a bad movie but i guess it 's just not that bad,then the story goes to a little girl named troy who is trying to get her husband to
1,this film is a must see,this movie is not worth the price
1,a few years ago i saw the trailer on the,a very funny movie that 's funny to watch
1,of course the only thing that makes it worth is the fact that the movie is,of course it is the fact that this film is a complete waste of time
1,you 'll see that it 's a movie,you know that the director is a little more
1,the film was a bit of a mess and i would n't have,the acting is good and the story is a bit too contrived
1,gina 's father is a very good one and a good one,gina and her boyfriend 's daughter are in love with her
1,lin 's performance as an actor is a bit of a stretch,lin is the one who has been in love with her
1,a lot of people have commented on this movie but the film has a,a few scenes of the movie were the best parts of the movie
1,but it is n't the same movie,but the story is a bit slow and
1,this was a very funny movie,this film is so bad it 's
1,normally i have n't seen the original but this is a very good one,normally it 's a little slow but i think the movie is really good and
1,nonetheless it is a great show and i hope they do it again,nonetheless the film is a little bit too long and too long for the
1,this movie is so bad it 's almost funny,this film is not only about a young man who
1,reavis 's character is the best thing about this film and it 's not a great performance by,reavis is a very strong man who is willing to accept his love for his own life
1,having a great deal of fun and a good time in my life i was n't disappointed,having read the book it 's a bit of a disappointment but it is n't as good as
1,i was n't expecting a great movie,i was so excited about it
1,i do n't want to spoil it for you to see it,i think this movie is one of the best of the series and
1,sure there 's a lot of action,sure it 's a bit dated
1,lorna is a great actress and she does n't,lorna 's character is a little more interesting
1,i do n't think this movie was made for the sake of it,i think the movie has a lot of good points to it
1,actually the movie is a complete mess,actually i think this was a good idea
1,from the opening shot of the film the movie wraps up the pace of the,from the beginning of the film i was expecting a lot from the film
1,this is a film that should be avoided by everyone,this film is a great example of why a film is
1,in a way it 's a great movie,in the end it 's a great story that
1,by far the worst movie i 've ever seen,by the time the credits rolled i was left wondering
1,one of the best films of the year and i would recommend this to everyone,one of the best movies ever made and the best one is the one where the
1,it 's a great film and a great example of what is wrong with a movie,it is a shame that the film is so hard for the eyes and the viewer to
1,it is a great film for a rainy day,it 's a shame because it has a very good
1,it 's a pity that this film was not available on dvd,it 's a shame because it is not the same movie as i
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie,the movie has some good points but it 's not
1,i do n't want to spoil the plot,i was surprised that i did n't pay to
1,when the film 's first two minutes of the film are,when the movie starts the film is a bit slow
1,it 's not even the best film of the year,it 's a pity that they have to make more movies
1,none of the characters seem to care about any of the characters,none of the characters seem real enough to have been given a chance
1,the film is a complete mess of,the movie is a complete mess
1,some scenes are so stupid and so badly edited that it is almost impossible to understand why they,some people have complained that this movie is a little slow but the acting is very good
1,john wayne was a great actor but he was n't in the movie,john cusak plays a young woman who 's a little more than a little
1,while the movie has a very good premise the story is very simple,while this is a great movie it 's not a good one
1,these two are very funny and the characters are likable,these two men are a bunch of people who have been
1,also the movie is a bit slow,also the movie is very funny
1,then there 's the fact that this film was made by someone who had to go through,then there 's some nice cinematography and a few nice touches but it 's not enough
1,what i did n't know about this film was that it was made for,what i got was a movie that could have been so much better
1,i do n't think it 's a good idea,i do n't know if i could have done a
1,also the film is a bit of a,also the movie was shot on location
1,the film has a lot of action sequences,the film was a complete waste of time
1,what is the difference between the two,what i found interesting is the way the
1,he 's a great director but he has a good,he 's a good actor and a good actor
1,as a result the story of a young woman in the,as the movie goes on it 's easy to follow
1,by the time it comes out the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,by the time it was over the movie was just a bit too much
1,i do n't think that the movie was made for a reason,i think that the movie is a good example of how to make
1,plus the acting is n't bad either,plus i have seen a lot of movies
1,this movie is one of the worst of the year,this is the kind of movie that you should watch

1,i do n't think this movie is the worst of the lot but it does n't really matter,i do think it would be a good movie to see a movie that was made for a few
1,though the plot is n't as simple as the first movie it 's a good one,though the film is a good one it 's a bit slow and dull and the acting
1,i was so excited to see this film on tv,i do n't understand how this film is going to be
1,deliberately it 's a very good movie with the usual clichs,deliberately the film is a little bit of an oddity
1,the film is a bit of a mess and a little slow but,the story is very interesting and i really do n't know why
1,the film has a great deal of action and suspense,the film is not a complete disaster but it 's a

1,i was n't expecting much of a movie to,i have to agree with other comments here
1,i have seen this movie many times and i think the movie is a masterpiece,i think this is one of the most underrated movies i have seen in a long
1,do n't waste your time with the movie,do not watch this film if you want a
1,but i was n't expecting much,but it 's just a fun little
1,the film 's plot is a bit thin and the ending is predictable,the movie is about a bunch of people trying to get a new home
1,the film has a very strong story and a,the film is a complete waste of time
1,the acting is good but it 's just a poor script,the film was shot in the same location as a digital play
1,so if you 're going to make,so what if they are n't
1,the film is a little bit of a bore,the film is about a group of people who are
1,also the film is a bit of a bore,also i thought this was a great film
1,and the ending is a bit anticlimatic but i was really shocked,and i do n't think that this was the best movie i had
1,i was so disappointed that it was a long,i was n't impressed with it at all
1,all of these elements are present in the film,all the actors are excellent and the script is great

1,the film 's plot was a bit thin for me but it was still a good film,the film is a bit of a mess though it is a bit overlong and not worth a
1,although the movie was a bit slow at times i was left wondering,although the story is not very interesting it is a good movie
1,but it 's not a movie,but the real problem is the script
1,anyway i do n't know what to say but,anyway this is the worst movie ever made
1,if you want to see a movie about a group of young people who do not want to get together with the same man who can act like that,if you want to make a movie about the life of the characters in a movie that has a lot of things going for it then it is a good
1,newland depardieu plays an eccentric man who gets his wife to a mental institution and is forced to go undercover to,newland stevens and john goodman were excellent as the two brothers and they both were great together in the roles
1,i was surprised to see this film,i was n't impressed at all the movie
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,this movie was a great example of how the film
1,i was so bored when it ended and i did n't care what was going on,i do n't want to ruin the movie for you but you will probably be disappointed by
1,and that 's why the movie is so good,and i think that is why it 's so bad
1,it 's the kind of movie you would watch with a group or two and a pizza,it 's the kind of thing that you 'll have to do in a movie theater
1,first of all i do n't think that the movie is really bad and i would have given it a higher rating,first off i was n't expecting a lot of action and i found it very hard to believe the actors could actually act
1,for the first time in the movie i had to see it for the first time in the past,for those who like the genre of this movie i think that this film is not worth watching
1,from the very beginning we learn that the mother is the killer and she is a witch,from the opening scene of the film i was expecting the most disturbing scene in a film
1,daniel daylewis plays a man who 's a little too late and the film 's climax in the middle is just too much for him,daniel daylewis plays the part of his character and i think he 's a great actor and i have n't seen him since the first time
1,but this is a film that is so bad you 'll be able to sit through this entire movie,but this is a movie that i would n't have known if it had been released on dvd
1,yet the movie is n't so bad it 's good,yet the movie is so bad it 's funny
1,even the actors are n't the least bit likable,even the actors in this movie do n't make sense
1,from the opening scene to the end credits to the film to be a bit more than the sum of,from the opening scene of the film the camera pans off and we 're left to see the scene
1,it 's the kind of movie that,it 's not a bad movie
1,they are the ones that are n't,they are both funny and funny
1,the film has a lot of potential to make it a little slow but it does n't matter at all,the film is about the same subject of the story of a woman who is married to a woman who has
1,after a few episodes i was hooked by the story and the characters,after a few episodes of the show the show started out to be a
1,they are the ones who have to be the most talented person to ever grace a,they were all very believable in their roles and the movie was a real stinker
1,as for the film it 's a little dated,as a result the film is a bit of a
1,their relationship with each other and their relationships and their relationship is so,their characters are so stupid that i have no sympathy for them
1,mitchell 's role in the first movie is so good that it 's not even funny,mitchell and the rest of the cast are also excellent especially the ones who are in the
1,the film was shot in black and white and was filmed at the same time as a studio,the film 's main weakness is that this film does n't have any of the same problems
1,i do n't know what the point of it is,i do not know what the point of this is
1,someone is a fan of the original and this movie is one of,someone else is the one who gets the girl and her sister
1,so i do n't think that this is a good movie for,so i have to say i was impressed by this film
1,i think the film was a great movie,i have to say i was very impressed
1,either way the movie is just plain bad,either way it 's a great movie
1,maybe it would be unfair to say the movie was,maybe it 's the best of all the actors
1,do n't waste your time with this film,do n't be fooled by the fact that it
1,this movie is a must see for any fan of the genre,this is one of the best movies i 've seen in my life
1,the acting was n't too bad but the story was pretty,the acting is very good and the story is good
1,she was a very beautiful woman,she 's the one who is n't
1,well i do n't know what the hell was going on,well i have a feeling that this movie was a waste of
1,i do n't want to ruin the ending but i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt,i was expecting a movie to watch but this one was so horrible that it could n't have been
1,oh and a lot of the film 's,oh and the music and the soundtrack
1,claire forlani plays the mother who 's,claire danes is a great actress
1,and the film 's climax is very well handled,and the acting is n't bad at all
1,even though it 's the only one that i 've seen i can honestly say,even though it has a few faults the movie has a very good cast
1,it is not a film for everyone,it was a waste of time
1,some of these are a bit too long,some of the scenes are pretty good
1,marcos and his friend are the two starcrossed leads who have a very difficult time with each other and their friendship,marcos is a good actor but his role is so bad that he makes you wonder if it was his character that
1,i do n't know how it ended up being a good movie but that 's it,i was n't really sure what was going on but it was so bad that you just
1,i do n't know why i did n't watch this movie because i had a hard,i do n't want to spoil the ending but the movie does have its moments
1,however the story is n't that bad,however the film is n't a good film
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to say that the film has a lot of,i do not want to spoil the movie for you but i 'll give it a try
1,the film has a lot of action and a good plot,the film is a bit too long and the story is too
1,oh and the last scene where the hero and the other girl are on screen,oh and it is a shame that the only reason i watched this movie is because
1,i have to agree with another reviewer who stated that the movie had been released on dvd and it,i do n't know why the critics did n't like this movie but it 's a great film
1,it 's not a movie that will appeal to everyone but it is,it is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
1,okay the plot is pretty basic but the movie is n't bad,okay so the movie is a little slow but it 's still very
1,the film is a very interesting one at that and is very very very good,the film was made for the sole purpose of being a good movie and it would
1,the movie is a bit slow at times,the acting was good the story was ok the
1,was he supposed to be a comedy or just plain stupid,was the movie supposed to have a little too much
1,the film is not a bad film,the film was a waste of time and
1,it 's a pity that the director and writer did n't even have a clue about the movie 's existence,it is not a film that you will not forget about a film that has been made and forgotten
1,but the film is n't so much a story about the life of a man who has a daughter,but it is n't the same as the first film which was n't even a good one either
1,it is a shame the film has n't received a wider audience since it,it is a very simple movie and it 's a joy to watch
1,we are left to wonder if the film is a true love story and a very good one at that,we are not told that we are not going to be able to see the movie as a whole
1,it 's not that bad but it is still a great movie,it 's a shame that the film did n't get better
1,george lucas 's direction is excellent and it is a shame that he did n't direct this,george clooney is a great actor and i hope he gets a lot of screen time
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the acting
1,this film is a must see,this is the first movie i have
1,it is not a good movie to,it was n't a good movie
1,the acting is good the plot is a little too weak for words and the characters are n't even remotely interesting,the film has a lot of action sequences and the ending is a little abrupt but you can tell it was a
1,i think that the film was a great idea to make,i was surprised to see the movie on the imdb
1,an example of what is wrong with this movie is how it 's,an old man is killed and he does n't have a clue
1,i was n't impressed when it was released,i was expecting a lot better than the first
1,oldboy is a film that has a lot to say,oldboy is a film that should never be released
1,there are some good performances in this film,there 's no real explanation for that
1,by the way the film is a masterpiece,by the end of the movie you are left
1,what is this supposed to be about,what 's the point of making such a
1,but the movie is a bit too,but it was not a movie
1,that was the only thing that kept me watching,that said it was n't the worst movie i have
1,indeed i was impressed with the film,indeed this movie is not for everyone
1,but it 's not as bad,but it is n't that bad
1,wagner is an interesting character and he is not the only one to be seen,wagner is the only one who can get a hold up from the film and he
1,for the first half of it i found myself asking myself what the hell was that,for me it was just a movie that i would n't have seen as a child
1,for those who have n't seen it i would say it 's one of the,for me it is a film that will appeal to everyone in the mood
1,live action is a great film for everyone involved,live feed is a very enjoyable movie that is a
1,it 's not a movie that you,it 's not even a movie
1,that was the only reason i gave this movie 2,that was the most ridiculous part of the movie
1,i was n't sure what to expect,i was n't expecting much of this movie
1,if you have not seen it you will be disappointed,if you have seen the original series and you 've seen
1,this was a very good movie,this is one of my favourite movies
1,best of all the movie was a bit long and i did n't really understand,best of all is the music which was the best i 've ever heard
1,angry and unhappy is a very good show,angry to be taken seriously and it 's a
1,treasure of the living dead is the story of a,treasure is a film that is worth a watch
1,since i have seen a lot of movies and movies that have been made in the,since it is the most controversial movie in the world it is not a movie
1,to be fair i do n't think that it 's the fault of the film,to be honest it has a lot of action and some great action scenes
1,some of the acting was ok but,some have commented on this movie
1,i have never seen such a bad movie in my life,i was n't sure whether it was a spoof of the book
1,anyway the story line is pretty weak,anyway the film is about a young boy
1,and i do n't think that the director was aiming for,and the ending is just as bad as the first
1,to me it is a film that has been done by a wider audience,to me this was a good movie for those who enjoy a good laugh and
1,sure it 's a little bit of a rip off of the original but it is not,sure it is a good idea to have a movie that 's supposed to be a remake of
1,for the first time i have to say that i am not a big fan,for a while i was surprised to find that i did n't like it
1,that 's the only reason to watch this movie,that is the only thing that i can say
1,from the beginning i was surprised to see that this movie was made for the sole purpose of being a good film but not a bad film,from the opening scene where a young woman is raped by a woman she has been stabbed in a tree by the sea to be eaten by the
1,if you 're looking for a good movie with a great plot line good acting great acting and great acting this is the film for you,if it was n't for the fact that it is not a movie i would have been surprised by the lack of originality and coherence that the
1,the movie starts off as a comedy with a lot of laughs and turns out,the movie is about the struggle between the two brothers and the two families
1,the film is about a man who is sent in,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,plus i was a bit prejudiced when i first saw the,plus the acting was horrible and the acting was bad
1,in fact the movie is so bad it makes you laugh and cry,in this movie he plays the role of a young woman who is attracted
1,i was expecting a good movie,i do n't think it 's a

1,the movie is about a young woman who goes to a new school where she,the movie is about the struggle between the mother and son and the mother
1,regarding the fact that the movie is about a young boy who lives,regarding that this film was a total waste of time and money
1,he 's a little too young to be funny,he is a good actor and a very good actor
1,every single person who is in it has a great time and you ca n't help but feel sorry,every time the film is over the camera is in a scene that makes it seem so long
1,this is a very funny film and one of the funniest,this movie is not a comedy it is n't a movie
1,to me that 's the only reason why this movie,to be fair it 's not that great either
1,the film is a very good film and it 's a great film,the film is a bit slow and slow but it really works
1,in fact it 's a very good film,in this movie the main characters are a group
1,this is one of those rare movies that you will never see again,this is not the worst film ever made but it is a good one
1,on the other hand the film is very good and the actors who play are excellent,on the other hand it is a film that has no real redeeming value at all
1,i have to say i was impressed,i have n't seen the movie since it
1,it 's a very good story,it is a movie that is not
1,there is also a good deal of nudity and violence and the whole thing is pretty good,there is no plot no story no character development no story no story just a little boring

1,having seen this movie several times i still have a fondness for the film,having seen it in the theater i was very impressed by the film
1,while this movie is a bit long i think the film is a little too,while the movie is n't a bad movie it is a very good film
1,from the very beginning of the movie there is an interesting amount of gore and violence,from the very start i was surprised that i had never seen a film that was so
1,the acting is good the story is good,the movie is about a bunch of people who
1,after all the film is a complete waste of time and money,after all these years the movie is a very good movie
1,the film is not about a man who is a loner and he is also a loner,the movie is a little bit too long and the plot is n't that good and the ending

1,this was a great movie for me,this is a very funny movie with a
1,it 's a pity because it was,it 's a very good film
1,finally the film is a bit over the top,finally the film was made up in the end of
1,a few of the scenes were shot in the movie but it was a bit overdone to me,a few years later the two men were on the verge of the war and they were forced to
1,this is one of those movies that you will not,this is one of the best of the genre
1,i was n't impressed when it came out in,i think the movie was made for kids
1,the movie is a little slow but i think the,the acting is horrible but i was n't impressed
1,kermit is an old man and a man in a suit,kermit is the only one who can find the right guy

1,this is the worst of the worst movies ever made in my,this is one of the best films i have ever seen
1,frank sinatra plays the role of the father and his wife,frank morgan is the only one in the movie that does n't
1,i was surprised that it had been so bad,i was expecting something more like a film about two
1,everyone involved in the making of this film should have been ashamed of themselves for their,everyone involved is in the movie and the film is a complete waste of time
1,as the movie opens the plot develops as a comedy,as a movie i would n't be surprised if i had

1,good thing i can say about it,good thing i can do that
1,the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous,the film is a very moving one

1,i was n't impressed with it,i was so impressed by the film
1,because it 's a very good movie,because of the fact that this film does

1,i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it was n't,i have seen this movie twice and it was very good and very funny
1,i have to wonder if the film was intended to be a comedy,i do n't think that it was the fault of the film
1,their relationship with each other and their interactions and how each one is different from other shows is just amazing,their lives are n't so much of a problem and the film has a lot to do with a good time

1,the acting is good and the story is a bit too contrived,the movie was a bit slow but i was really surprised
1,this movie was made for the first time in the life that the director was trying to make it,this is a very good movie and a great example of how not to make a good movie
1,want to see the real movie in the future,want to get a copy of this movie
1,like a lot of the other reviewers this is the worst of the lot,like many other movies this one is a bit too much to be taken seriously

1,i have to say i was n't impressed,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,20 years later i have to admit that this film is a complete waste of time,20 years ago i had a chance to watch the movie again and again and again and

1,this is not a film to be seen,this is not the type of film that is
1,it 's a very funny movie and a great one,it 's a shame that the movie was so bad that
1,that 's the best thing about the movie,that is the case of the film 's plot

1,it is a very good movie and it is a great film for those who,it is a great movie to be watched by anyone who enjoys good movies
1,people who have read the book will read it and do not understand that the movie is not as,people have been warned about the fact that the story was n't a little bit of a stretch
1,this was a very funny movie with a very,this movie is so awful it 's laughable
1,it is a shame that this movie is not only available on dvd in the uk but it will be,it 's a shame because the film is not a comedy it is a drama that 's not funny
1,with the help of his father the film is a bit slow and drags on too,with a cast of unknowns i would have liked this movie to be a masterpiece
1,hysteria and the beast is one of the most beautiful and beautiful movies ever made,hysteria is the story that is a bit of an adventure but it 's not a
1,i do n't know why i did n't get it,i have to say that i am very impressed with the
1,before the movie starts i have to admit i was n't impressed,before i saw this film i thought that it was a good film
1,it is a shame that the film is so poorly made that it does n't have a lot,it 's a shame that such a low rating for this film did not get released theatrically
1,the movie has a lot to offer,the film is a bit of a mess
1,this is the first time i have,this movie has a great cast
1,it is not a movie for kids,it was n't even that bad
1,the film is a bit of an,the acting and directing were excellent
1,the movie has a lot of potential and the story is pretty good but the story line is so bad,the story is about the adventures of the people who live in the house and the two of them
1,specializing with the fact that it 's a film of a few years ago it is not a comedy,specializing in the fact that he 's in his own right hand to get the girl to go on a
1,this is one of those movies that you will,this film is a complete waste of time
1,for a movie like this i have to say that i was impressed,for the first half of the film it 's not even worth mentioning that
1,a very enjoyable movie with great actors,a very good movie with great acting by
1,agent and the tramp is the first to have a 66 minute running time,agent is a good guy who is trying to get to the bottom of the
1,it is a great movie and i,it 's a very good film
1,more than just a movie about a young woman who is in the middle and,more than a little of a mess it is a bit of a spoof
1,the movie is about a bunch of young adults,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,this was a great movie for a long long long time,this film is a great movie that will appeal to everyone and
1,i was surprised by the amount of detail that this was made for the movie,i have n't seen a lot of movies but i have n't watched the movie so
1,this was a very good movie,this is a movie that is n't
1,donna and her friend have a relationship and a relationship,donna 's mother is the daughter of the mother
1,the movie is about the same people who are in the same predicament,the film was a little slow but it was a little bit too long
1,of course the movie is not a good,of course there 's the usual clich
1,his character is a caricature of a man who is a loner and a martyr,his character is a caricature of an old man and his son who is the only
1,and it is a great movie to watch for,and that 's what i would call it
1,allowances for the acting and the acting,allowances for this film is a good idea
1,touted to the audience the movie has a very strong plot and the actors are all fine,touted as the first film in the series the film 's title is the same name
1,they 're all very funny and the film 's humor is infectious,they are not the same as the ones who have been on a
1,this is the kind of film that you,this movie has a lot of problems
1,this is one of the worst films,this movie is a must see
1,i'm a big fan of the original,i'm not sure why it 's not so
1,it is not a movie to watch but it is not,it was the first time that i was able to see it
1,all of this is a very good idea,all i have seen is a film that is
1,their performances are excellent and the story lines are very good,their relationship was not as much as the characters but the story
1,this film is not for everyone but if you like the genre you might,this movie is so bad that you can see the director 's intentions
1,then the film goes on to make a point about the plot,then there are those who have n't been in the military for the
1,at one point the movie is a very good one,at least the film is a little bit more enjoyable and
1,the movie was shot in a very cheap way but it was not,the film was shot in a time where the film was shot and edited
1,also the ending is very predictable,also the film was shot in a
1,i was so disappointed that i could n't find anything to do with this,i have seen it three times and i have n't seen it since
1,also the movie is a very good one and a lot of fun,also a lot of the scenes are shot in the same place
1,we get a glimpse of the real events of our lives and their relationships and the way,we are not told that the film is a masterpiece but it 's a great film
1,i was expecting a movie to be made in the past and the film was,i think it 's a good movie and i would recommend it to everyone
1,morgan freeman is excellent as always and the,morgan freeman was great as the villain
1,before the movie started to get the point across it,before you know it i was a little disappointed
1,i think the movie is a little too much for me,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but i did
1,when i watched the film i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry but the film is not a,when i saw it on cable tv i knew i had seen the first one and was n't impressed
1,he was n't even a hero,he was a great director and i
1,the acting is pretty good but i was surprised to see that there were some really bad actors,the film has a lot of good things about it and it is not a bad movie
1,the acting and the direction are very good,the acting is very weak and the story is
1,the acting in this film is very good and the story is very good,the movie starts off with the first of three stories in which they are trying
1,i do n't know if i was a fan of the book or not,i was expecting this to be a good movie but it was n't
1,in this movie it was a very good,in fact the movie is very funny
1,by now the film was shot in a small budget,by the way the film is set in the same location
1,as a result the film has a certain charm to be had,as the movie progresses you can feel for yourself and you will be
1,you can tell that it is a good film,you know the drill is a big hit
1,and the ending where a little boy is revealed in the film,and the film has a lot of action scenes and a lot of
1,this film has a lot to do with the plot and the acting,this is a movie that is not just a collection of bad skits but
1,end of spoilers i was n't expecting a good film but i had a good time and i could not get it to,end spoiler i was surprised at how many times i have seen the film i was n't sure what to expect from the movie
1,he is a great actor but he is n't,he is the only person who can identify
1,and the acting is pretty bad,and that 's why i gave this
1,see it if only for the presence of an attractive woman who is,see the movie if you 're not a fan of the original
1,unfortunately i do n't think it is the same way as the,unfortunately it is not a film that is a complete bore
1,do n't worry that the movie is a waste of time,do n't get me wrong i love the show but i do
1,however i think the best thing about it is that the story is not,however the film is n't really about the real world of the characters
1,just like a movie about a young,just do n't expect a lot
1,it is not a film to watch but it is,it 's a shame that such a bad film
1,the acting is good but the script is so awful that you cannot believe the actors are actually doing their,the acting is very good and i have to admit that it was a good choice for the movie
1,this movie is so bad it makes you want,this is not the case with the movie
1,so i guess it 's the best movie,so what if you can see it
1,everybody is a caricature of the story and the characters in their roles are all believable,everybody is a good looking person but the movie is so bad that it makes the movie
1,9 the movie has no redeeming qualities to the film,9 the acting is horrible and the acting was horrible the
1,the movie is very well done and the actors are all good but the,the film is a bit slow but it 's also very well done
1,and it is a great film,and it is a good idea to
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to say it was great to see,i do n't understand the point of the film but it was the first time that i
1,final verdict this is a film for the whole family,final verdict this movie was a waste of time
1,fans of the original series will enjoy this film,fans of this series should be ashamed of themselves
1,when the movie ended i was left speechless,when the film 's title suggests that the director
1,it 's not a movie about the evils of war or the,it was a waste of time and money to see it
1,i was n't really impressed by this movie,i was so bored that i could not get
1,i do n't know what the director was,i was n't impressed by the film
1,the film was shot at a time when it was made in the early 20th,the movie has a very nice feel to it that makes it worth watching
1,a lot of the scenes are very funny and the,a lot of people have commented on this movie
1,as i said it was n't a good movie,as for the rest of the cast i think the
1,and the ending is a little abrupt,and that is the reason why this movie
1,he was a great actor and i was very impressed with this movie,he was the first of the many things he did n't commit
1,well i do n't know how i can get,well it was a little bit too late
1,she is a beautiful woman who has to deal with her,she 's a little more than a little too much
1,i do n't know why i was able to watch the film but i did,i was surprised to see that this film has been released theatrically in theaters
1,on the other hand the acting is pretty bad and the story line is n't really that bad,on top of that i think the film was very good and i think it 's a shame that
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was surprised that this film was released
1,he is a very talented actor and he is a great actor,he 's the only one who has a crush on him in the
1,nevertheless this film is a very enjoyable one,nevertheless it is a very good film
1,i have to wonder how this film was made,i do n't know why this is a bad movie
1,christie is one of my favorites,christie is not the only one to
1,someone else is just trying to be funny and the film fails miserably,someone who has seen the movie will know that there is no way of
1,what i found most irritating about this movie,what 's with all these stupid people
1,how can a film be so bad,how could they have a movie with a
1,but i do n't want to give away the ending,but the story of the film is not that great and
1,for me the most interesting aspect of the film is,for the most part the acting is pretty good
1,robert englund is also a very good actor,robert englund 's acting was pretty good but the
1,george lucas is a master of the genre and he 's not only the most talented director of the genre but also,george clooney is one of the best actors of the 80s and he is great in the role of john mcclane
1,the film is a little slow at times but it does n't make up for the lack of a plot,the story line is very good and it 's not just a story about the lives of two men who are
1,i think this is a great film for everyone,i was n't expecting much of the movie to be
1,the acting is very bad but it 's a,the acting and direction are all very good
1,just a few years earlier i was a bit skeptical when it,just like the other reviewer said this is a good movie
1,it 's a shame that such a bad movie has never made a plotholes for the,it 's a shame that the director of this film has never seen it before
1,one of the best movies ever made,one of the most interesting films of the
1,i have never been a fan of the original,i think that 's a good thing because the movie
1,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the,this was the first time he had a major career
1,she is the only one who can,she 's just a bad girl
1,overall it is a good movie,overall this is one of the best
1,for a movie made on video i was impressed with it,for the rest of the movie the characters are not developed as
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film has no real plot and no character development
1,the film has a very nice cast and the actors are all excellent,the film 's story is not a very interesting idea to follow and the
1,it is n't that i have to be a little too harsh and i can appreciate the movie,it 's the same old man who has a small child and a young man who is n't a
1,despite being a little dated the film is very well done and it is very well done and the story is so good,despite the fact that the story is not about an american couple it 's a very very very very very bad movie
1,brothers and dolls alike and their families and the people in the,brothers and dolls are n't the best ones to be seen
1,then there 's a lot of action,then the story begins to unravel
1,those who have n't seen this film will probably enjoy it,those who do n't like the movie are not going to get
1,wahlberg is one of the best in this film,wahlberg is the only actor in his career who can
1,but the real problem was that i was not sure,but i think this film is not for everyone
1,and it was n't even that bad,and it was n't a good idea
1,am i the only one who can say this movie,am i the only one who has seen this
1,overall this movie is a must see,overall it was n't very good
1,on the plus side the acting is superb and the story is so good,on top of that the story is very weak and the ending is so bad
1,avoid at all costs if you want,avoid this movie like the plague
1,if you want to see the worst movie ever made then this is the one,if you are a fan of the original you 'll find it hard to believe that
1,i do not know how this film was made,i was surprised that this movie did not receive any
1,the film is a bit slow but the,the movie was a waste of time
1,now this is the best thing to come out of the ordinary film genre,now that i 've watched it and i can safely say that i do n't
1,there 's a lot of gore and some gore,there is a lot more to this film than the
1,this film is not a comedy but a comedy,this is the first film i 've seen in a
1,light hearted and very well done by the director and cast,light hearted and witty and the film has some nice moments but
1,at the end of the film the viewer is asked to believe that the film is not a complete failure but it,at first i thought that the movie was a little bit of a stretch but the story is n't that bad
1,the film has a few faults in the plot and some very funny moments which makes,the film has a great deal of humor but not enough to make it worthwhile
1,and i think it 's not that i am a fan of the original,and that 's the only thing this movie has going for it is it 's
1,perhaps this was a good movie,perhaps the most interesting aspect of the
1,two of the most memorable films of all time are the ones that are so funny and fun,two of the best actors in this movie were the supporting players and the great supporting cast
1,this is a great movie and a must see,this is the first movie i have ever seen
1,ok it is a good movie but i do n't think it 's a bad movie,ok i have to admit i have to say that i am not the only one who
1,and that 's why it 's not funny,and it is n't a good idea to be
1,kate capshaw is the best actress of the bunch,kate beckinsale plays the mother and mother of the mother
1,incoherent plot twists and turns of events,incoherent and predictable and i would n't be
1,when the movie was released it was released in the us,when i saw this movie i had a great time watching this
1,william shatner was a bit too old to play the lead role in the film,william wyler is one of the great underrated directors of all time and the film is
1,even the most ardent of people who are not,even the music and dancing was pretty good
1,it 's a great movie to see,it is a great movie to watch
1,that is a shame because i was so impressed that i was,that 's why i gave it a 2 out of 10
1,i think the film is a bit too long and it has a lot,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was n't disappointed
1,considering this is a low budget production it is a very low budget horror film with some very good,considering the fact that this is the most expensive movie ever filmed it was a waste of time
1,however i do n't want to spoil the movie,however the movie is not a bad one
1,gloria grahame is a great choice for her role as the woman who is a little more interesting and she is,gloria swanson is also excellent as the woman who gets her husband to get a job in a car accident
1,he is a good actor but his character is just too bland,he 's not even in the movie and he 's not funny at
1,silly and boring but it was still,silly movie that is n't funny
1,branaugh and the rest of the cast,branaugh 's performance is very good
1,i was surprised to see this movie on a low budget,i was surprised to find this movie in the bargain bin
1,there was no real reason for that,there is a scene where a woman is
1,i have n't seen this show yet but i,i do n't think it 's that bad
1,predictably i have to say the film is a bit long,predictably the film is about a young girl who is a little
1,not to mention the fact that it 's a,not a great movie but a good one
1,aiding a couple of friends and a bunch of friends and the girl 's daughter who is a bit of an accident,aiding the two leads in a movie that is a bit more than the sum of its parts and a bit of the
1,while the film is a little slow at times it is not a comedy,while this is n't a great movie it 's not as good as some of
1,her character was so stupid that i felt like she,her character is a caricature of a young woman
1,at least that 's why the movie was so bad,at least that 's what the film is about
1,unfortunately the script and acting are so bad that it 's hard to believe that this was a,unfortunately this film is not for everyone but for those interested in history and its subject matter
1,in fact the movie was a complete waste of time and,in this case the movie is a very good movie
1,once the movie starts to drag and the viewer gets to know the characters and the audience are left wondering if it 's a comedy,once you get past the fact that the characters are n't developed in the first act you will see the characters in the first half of
1,this is not a bad movie,this is the worst movie i 've
1,yes the movie was n't a good movie it was just bad and it was n't even bad,yes i know that this is a movie that is n't a complete disaster but i do n't know
1,as a result of the fact that the movie is set in a time warp is,as the story unfolds it becomes a bit confusing but it is a great movie
1,when the movie is about a man 's life it is very easy to identify with the characters and the story,when i saw this on the shelf i was amazed to find that it is a film about the hardships of a
1,this is a very good film,this is a great film to watch
1,one of the most interesting films ever made,one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,i have to say i was impressed by the fact that i had,i have seen it several times and it 's still pretty funny
1,it 's a shame that the film never gets released,it 's a shame to see such a great movie in
1,and the acting is so bad it 's funny to watch,and it does not take long for the film to get a
1,in fact it 's a shame because this movie,in fact it 's a very good film
1,for the most part the acting is terrible the plot is ridiculous,for those who like a good movie you can enjoy the movie
1,it 's a shame to see a movie that has such a good story,it is a shame that the film is n't available in video format
1,when i saw this film at the toronto film festival it was an absolute joy,when i first heard about this film i was expecting a movie that was n't a
1,this is one of the most underrated movies i have,this movie was so bad i had to laugh
1,like a lot of the other films i 've seen this is the first time i saw it and i was impressed by it,like the other reviewer who commented on the movie the acting the directing the directing the direction everything was bad the story was terrible and
1,richard widmark is a great actor but the rest of the cast is n't bad either in this one,richard widmark plays a very convincing role as the troubled and somewhat cynical wife of the family of a young
1,get to know the characters the actors the actors and the,get the money to rent this movie and watch it
1,is this a good thing to do,is it the bad guy that is the
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting was terrible and the story
1,charles durning was the only one who had the charisma to make the role of this movie and his character is very believable,charles grodin plays the role of a man who 's been assigned to murder the man who has been killed by a corrupt killer
1,and that 's what makes the film so memorable,and i have to say that i am a big
1,it 's just that the movie is not so much a comedy,it was a good idea and a great cast but i was impressed
1,i was n't impressed with any of the actors in the movie but i,i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,instead we get a bunch of annoying characters that seem to be trying to be funny but they 're not really,instead of a movie that is so bad you ca n't even tell what 's going on and it 's all about
1,when the film is over you 're left with a feeling of emptiness,when i saw this movie i thought it was going to be a good
1,blood and gore are the main reason to watch a horror movie,blood and guts are a bit of a threat but the movie is
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this movie is one of the funniest movies i 've
1,on the other hand it is not that the story,on the other hand it is very well done
1,this is the first of three movies that i 've seen in my lifetime,this is one of those movies that is so bad it is funny
1,not that it was n't a bad film it 's a waste of,not that the movie was bad but the actors were n't bad
1,the film is a bit long but i found it to be a,the acting is good with the exception of a few of them
1,another reason why the film has a great cast,another problem is the lack of a plot

1,of course the only thing that is n't the most important is the fact that the movie does n't get a lot of attention from the audience,of course the story is n't that bad it is a little bit of a good movie and it 's a shame to see such a good movie
1,perhaps the most interesting part is the fact that the movie has a few good moments but it 's still a good film,perhaps it would have worked better if the director had a more coherent script but the director should have given it a much more
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a wider release,it 's just a shame that the movie is not so bad it is
1,but it is not the best movie ever,but the film does n't really work out as

1,on the other hand it was a great show,on the other hand the film was a bit too
1,among the many films that i 've seen in a long time i have seen the best of this one,among the best i can remember was the fact that this film was made in the late 1950 's
1,while the film is a bit slow paced at times i liked this film very much,while the plot is a bit farfetched and the characters are not the best they are a

1,the movie is about a young man named benjamin who lives in a large apartment in the country,the movie is a very good film with a lot of action and some good action scenes

1,its a shame that the film has n't got a theatrical release,its a shame that the movie did n't make it big on the
1,but the film is a little bit slow moving,but it is not as bad as it sounds and

1,alan rickman was excellent and i hope that he is able to play his character,alan arkin plays the part of the father who is a bit of a jerk but
1,which was n't even the case in the first film,which is a shame since the movie is n't even a

1,here 's a list of the first few minutes,here is a movie where i was expecting a lot
1,the film is not about the evils of war but,the movie was shot in a cheap digital style
1,but i think this movie is a complete,but this is the best movie ever
1,for me it seemed to me as if the director was reading the script for his own film,for me the most memorable thing about this film is that it 's not just a bunch of kids
1,i was surprised to find myself in the theater,i do not know why this was n't released on
1,jim carrey is the only one who has a,jim carrey is great as the main character
1,it is n't the worst movie ever made but it 's a good film,it 's a shame to watch a movie that has a good story line and
1,more like the director of the original film and the director 's vision of the film the film is a bit too long for me,more than once there 's a scene where the two men are walking through a forest with a shotgun and a couple of the other passengers
1,i do n't think it was a waste,i was so bored by the movie
1,recent films have a lot of action,recent film noir in which a film is
1,i do think that the film was a little too long and i would,i was so impressed that i could n't get enough of the film

1,but i do n't know why,but the movie does n't have the
1,i do n't think it 's a bad movie because it is n't that bad,i have n't seen this show since it was released and it was a great movie
1,a few of the scenes are pretty much the same,a very interesting movie that is n't a good one to
1,rocky is an excellent actor and he 's not the worst actor i have,rocky 's father is one of the worst films i have ever seen
1,as for the rest of the cast i think the film is pretty good,as a matter of fact the film is a bit too long for me
1,there 's no real plot no character development or even a plot,there 's a bit of gore but not enough to save this movie
1,the movie was a little slow but i did n't really expect the plot,the story is simple and the story itself is n't too bad either
1,children should watch it and learn more about it and appreciate it,children of the corn do not have the power to do so
1,parents who are so obsessed with the subject matter that the characters are n't even,parents are the same people who are in the same predicament as a child
1,mr and mrs smith 's character is,mr bean is a good movie

1,the acting is very bad and the acting in the movie is horrible,the film is about a man who is trying to find a cure for
1,first of all it is not a film,first i was expecting a good film
1,he is the one who is the,he is a very good actor
1,i have to say that this was one of the best movies i 've seen in a very,i have n't seen it since i was a child and it 's not a bad movie
1,but the film does n't really have much to do with the first,but i do n't think that the movie is a total bore
1,it was n't even a movie that was a,it is not the best of the genre
1,so i was looking forward to this movie,so i do n't want to spoil it for
1,you know it is a good movie and,you know it 's a bad movie
1,attempt to be funny the film fails miserably,attempt to get to a point of view of
1,nevertheless it 's a good film to watch and you 'll enjoy it,nevertheless it 's not a great film but its not as good as the
1,additionally the story is a bit confusing and the plot is n't even remotely interesting,additionally i was very surprised to see that the film had some redeeming features
1,of course the film is not as bad as the original but,of course it is a movie that will make you laugh
1,i was n't impressed at all the movie was so bad that i had,i do n't think it 's a good thing to see this film
1,it is a great movie to watch,it 's a shame that the producers of
1,jimmy durante 's acting is a bit,jimmy durante is a great actor
1,fortunately it was not as good as the first one,fortunately the movie has a lot more to recommend it
1,bunuel is a genius and he 's not a good actor,bunuel is a great actor but he is a very talented director
1,he was a good actor but he is n't a good,he 's not a great actor but a great actor
1,okay so it 's a great movie,okay so the movie is a bit of
1,the film is a bit long and the story is very simple and the story is n't very interesting,the movie is about a young boy named angus who lives in a small apartment building in new york city
1,but it was a great film,but the movie does n't have a
1,but this movie is a total bore,but the film is a little too long
1,however i was surprised by the lack of a coherent script and a weak script,however i think that the director was trying to get the audience to think about the
1,it is a shame that this movie has never received a score of 3 or 4,it 's not even a movie and it is n't even worth mentioning the fact that the
1,if the director of the book was the same person who made it the film,if you 're a fan of horror films this one 's not for you
1,the movie was a waste of money and time,the acting is good and the script is good enough
1,mark wahlberg is a good actor but he does n't have the charisma to play,mark wahlberg is a great actor and i think that his performance is great
1,now i have seen it again and it 's not the same as the original,now i know that this was n't the worst movie i have seen in a long
1,maybe it 's just me but the story was very good,maybe it 's because it is n't a bad movie
1,the film has a lot of good things to say about the story but it is a very interesting,the story of a woman who was born to be a girl and the mother is very interesting
1,ged is an excellent character actor and i hope that,ged is a very talented and very talented actor
1,laura dern was a good choice for this movie,laura linney plays the part with her usual aplomb
1,overall it 's a good movie and it 's not a,overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10
1,the acting is good and the story is good,the film is a bit of a mess
1,eric bana is a great actor,eric stoltz plays a very convincing role
1,however it does n't matter to me that this was a bad movie,however this is a movie that i would recommend seeing the first half and
1,and the ending is just as satisfying as the ending of the movie,and the film is a little too long for the most of the time
1,at first i thought it was the best movie i have ever seen,at first the story does n't have any real plot but it 's a
1,they have a great deal of time to develop the,they are the most annoying characters in the movie
1,the acting was horrible and the story line was very,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,also the film is not as good as the first,also the movie does not make much of sense
1,naturally it 's not the same,naturally the film is a bit of
1,literally the film is a very good movie,literally the film is about the same subject as
1,the movie was made in the early 90 's and early 90 's and i was n't,the film is not as good as the original but it 's not a good one
1,ok i have to say that the movie was a waste of my time and money,ok so i was n't expecting a great movie but i did n't expect the movie to
1,fuller 's film is a complete failure,fuller is a great director but it is
1,you have to see the movie to find out if the movie is really good or not,you can see the director 's intentions in the film but that 's not what it is
1,altogether the movie has a lot of problems,altogether the film is n't bad enough but the
1,tony leung and robert duvall are both very good,tony is a very funny and funny guy
1,i do n't think that the movie was intended for children and adults,i do n't know why i was n't impressed by the movie
1,red buttons are the only things that do n't make this,red buttons is a movie that i would watch again
1,artificial and very funny and very entertaining,artificial and very well acted with a great
1,the story line is a bit thin,the acting is good but the script is
1,while i do not think that the director is trying to be a comedy he 's a good director and a,while the film is set against the backdrop it 's not a movie that has been seen in the us
1,the acting was horrible the directing was worse the directing was worse than the movie,the film is about a young boy who is diagnosed with a mental breakdown
1,my friend and i watched this film and it 's a great film,my only criticism is that it has a lot of action and a lot
1,it is not a film to see it 's the same,it is a movie about a man who loves a good guy
1,all of these are the only ones who,all in all a very enjoyable movie
1,a very good film with a good cast,a few scenes of a movie that are n't
1,i was n't sure whether this was an action movie or,i do n't want to spoil anything about this movie
1,being a big fan of the series i was expecting a lot more from it,being a fan of the genre i was surprised by the ending of this movie
1,can you imagine that the director was trying,can i mention the director 's commentary
1,the movie is a little slow and slow,the movie is a very interesting film
1,and it 's a very funny film,and the movie is a total mess
1,had i been watching this i 'd say that i would have been a little confused,had i ever seen the movie i would have been more interested to watch it again
1,seeing this movie is like watching a train wreck,seeing this film was a great piece of work that
1,just like a lot of the other films of this genre it 's a very good movie and a good,just like the other two movies i saw the trailer for this film and the description of the movie
1,even the most ardent fans of the genre should be advised to watch this film,even though it 's supposed to be a spoof of the genre i think it would
1,this is a movie about the evils of war and how people can be so stupid and,this was the first movie i saw that was n't even as good as the first
1,christians who have n't seen the original film have a lot,christians are the same people who are in the world
1,anyone who does n't know is that it will be an experience to watch,anyone who has ever seen the movie knows how to do a movie
1,despite being a bit of a good movie the acting is pretty good,despite being the most controversial of the two movies i still have a lot
1,in the end it is not as good a movie as it was,in fact it 's just so boring that the film never gets a chance
1,there is a scene where the hero and his wife,there is also a lot of nudity and nudity
1,one can only assume that this film is a total,one of the best movies of the last years
1,i have never heard of this movie and i do n't understand why,i was n't expecting the usual suspects that the director did n't know what
1,look for the scene where a young woman,look no further than the first movie
1,all in all a good film to watch and enjoy,all of these are not really what they seem like they
1,i think the film is very well made but it does n't have to,i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one was worse
1,cant wait till the next season comes out on dvd,cant believe it and not only to see if it is
1,over a dozen years ago i have a fondness to this film as i am a big fan of the genre,over the course of the movie there is a very nice twist in the film where it 's a little bit of
1,he 's not the best of the lot,he was n't even a hero and he was
1,this movie is a must see for all ages,this is one of the best movies i have ever
1,he is also in the movie for,he is not a good actor
1,just do n't expect to be a,just do n't expect a lot
1,samuel l jackson was the best in the movie,samuel l jackson is great as the evil butler
1,they are the best in the movie,they are all very attractive and have a
1,i have to say that i was impressed with this film,i was expecting the movie to end and the story was very
1,tom hanks plays the part with the character that is,tom and jerry 's bogus relationship is the best
1,i think the film is not a bad idea to make a movie about a bunch of people who are n't,i do n't know why i did n't like this movie but i think it would be a good one
1,how many people have seen this film,how many times do we get
1,all of the other actors have done their own good,all in all this movie is a complete mess

1,it 's just that the film was made for tv,it is a shame that the movie has a few moments
1,i have to admit that i have seen this movie several times and i can still say,i was n't really surprised by the fact that the film was made in a hurry
1,it is not the worst movie ever made but i do n't know what i was thinking,it 's a pity that the film never made it to the theater in the united states and
1,i have seen the movie several times and i still have the feeling that the film is,i have never been so disappointed by it and i have n't seen any of it
1,from a few years ago the film is a bit slow,from there the movie settles on a journey to the point of
1,i was expecting something like the original version but it 's not,i have to say that it was a waste of time
1,it 's a shame that the film has been released on dvd,it 's the kind of movie that you would want to see if
1,into the mix of the two men and the woman who played the mother of,into the mix of this movie the movie is a bit of a mess
1,but it is n't that bad,but the story is a bit too

1,maris and his men are the best,maris is a very good actor
1,well this is a good movie and it,well the film is a complete mess
1,aside from a few moments of violence it is a little too long for,aside from the obvious plot holes the film has a very predictable plot
1,the acting was terrible and the story line was just,the film is very good but it is n't
1,he is a very funny actor and a great,he 's the only actor who can act
1,burton is also the most interesting person in history,burton has done a great job of making a film
1,the story line is a bit thin,the film is a complete mess
1,the film was a little slow and the plot was,the film is a bit of a mess though
1,though the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who is a woman who is a woman and,though i have n't seen the original version of it i do n't think that it is a good movie
1,however it 's not that the film is n't so great as the,however this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,the movie is about a young woman who lives in a city with her mother who has a heart attack and a young,the film is a bit long and the ending is a complete copout but it does not really have the same impact
1,russia was a great success for the time,russia is an excellent film that is a must
1,the film was shot on location at a time when it was shot in black,the story is about a bunch of young adults who go on an isolated adventure trip
1,you can see it in a different kind of context,you can see the actors who are in the movie
1,unfortunately the film does not have any redeeming,unfortunately the story is n't that bad
1,if the movie was a comedy it was n't that good,if you 're looking for a movie that 's not funny or
1,the acting is pretty bad the story is bad,the film has a lot of potential to make it
1,but the story was so bad that,but the movie is n't bad
1,so if you have not seen it you will probably be missing,so i have to say that this is a good movie
1,he is the best character in this film,he 's a good actor but the script was
1,keep the film at all costs,keep the movie at a fast pace
1,there are a number of scenes that are very good,there are some very nice moments but it 's not
1,other than that the film is pretty good,other than that the movie is pretty good
1,the film is a bit slow but it does n't have to be the least bit of a mess,the movie is about a bunch of young adults that have a party and they are trying to escape from
1,look at the cast and crew of the movie,look for the first time i saw it in the
1,whatever the reason i was n't expecting a good film to be a good movie i was expecting something,whatever the reason the film is so bad that it 's not even worth renting for a laugh
1,this movie was so bad it 's almost laughable,this is the best movie i have ever seen in
1,i was n't sure what to expect,i do n't think i 've ever seen
1,i think the movie is just too much for me,i have to admit that the story line is so bad
1,then the film switches into the story of the two men,then there was the fact that it was a movie about two
1,in this case the film is not a bad film,in the end it was just a little too much to
1,it was a good idea to make a movie,it 's not even worth mentioning that it is a
1,i was expecting a lot of the story to go to the movie but i could n't help but feel,i was surprised at the end of this episode that i could n't wait to get to the end
1,i do n't know why i did n't like this film,i think the film was made by someone who had a lot
1,my favorite character is the one who is the one who,my only complaint is that it 's a bit slow
1,at the same time it 's the same,at first glance it was n't funny
1,the acting is very good and the acting is superb,the film is not about the evils of the world but
1,obviously the director of this film has a lot more to do with the fact that this movie is a remake of the original,obviously the filmmakers had no idea of how to create an atmosphere of tension and the characters were n't developed to care for the characters
1,so if i were to watch a movie about it then,so i do n't know why this film was made
1,so i was n't expecting anything much from it,so i do n't know what this movie is about
1,think of it as a comedy,think about it it was a good
1,first of all it was a little boring,first off i was n't expecting a lot of
1,the story was very weak and the acting was terrible,the film is about a man searching for her life
1,most of the time the movie is about a young woman who 's being married to a man named conchita,most of the movie consists of a bunch of people who are not in a movie with no real plot
1,starting with a very long monologue of the film 's initial revelation the film is set in the same place and the film is shot in a,starting with a good cast the film does n't have much in common with it 's predecessor but the story is a bit of a mess
1,but this movie is not the best movie i have ever seen,but the movie does n't really have any of the same
1,her performance in this movie is so bad it hurts her to say the least,her character is a stereotype who is the only character in the movie that makes her
1,consider it a movie about a group of people and a group of people,consider it the best of it 's kind but the movie is a bit too
1,i think that 's the point i do n't think i would want to see this movie,i have seen this movie several times in my life and i think it was great
1,and the ending of the film is so stupid and,and the ending was just too stupid and stupid
1,nearly as good as the first movie,nearly as if the director was trying to
1,the movie is a very good movie,the movie is a little bit too slow
1,the film has a lot of problems but is not a complete,the film is very well acted and the acting is great
1,so if you 're looking for a fun movie about a young boy who,so i was surprised by the ending and i was n't expecting anything
1,being a huge fan of this movie i was very impressed by it,being a huge fan of the original film i was expecting something more from
1,i have never read the novel and seen the film as a child,i do n't think i can even say the same thing about the movie
1,as the story progresses we learn that the world is not only a,as a fan of a film i have n't read the book
1,the acting was horrible the plot is bad and the story is so stupid it 's,the film is a little slow at times and is not even worth the time
1,above all this movie is a masterpiece,above all the acting was horrible
1,i was n't really impressed with the movie but it was a fun movie to watch,i think the film was a bit too long and it 's too long for me
1,it 's a shame the only negatives in the movie are the,it is a movie that is a joy to sit through
1,all of the actors and actresses were great,all in all a very good movie and i

1,there is a very good scene in which a woman is stabbed by a car that is parked on an open window,there is a scene where he is in a coma and the camera pans out of him and then the camera pans down
1,the movie is a little slow but the plot is very simple and the characters are believable,the film is a little bit of an exercise in a story that is not as good as

1,as i said before this is a great film,as i mentioned earlier the movie is a complete waste
1,it 's a shame that the movie has a lot of potential in its production,it is a shame that the director did not make a movie like this

1,you know what i was getting through and i did n't care,you 'll see it in your local video store and you will see
1,to me this was a very poor attempt at comedy and,to make a long story short it is the story
1,according to me this film was a huge hit,according to imdb 's synopsis i thought it was a
1,it was a waste of time,it 's a shame because the film
1,i do n't think that the film would have been a better place to have it,i do not think that the film is a good movie but it is not
1,he is the most beautiful person in hollywood and it is not his best film,he is a good actor but he is a bit too much for him
1,on top of that the film 's premise is a bit too much to be taken,on a side note the acting was excellent and the script was a little confusing
1,it 's a shame that such a film could n't be produced by anyone who is n't a fan,it 's a great show and i hope that the next season will be released on dvd soon
1,his character is a little too cocky and the movie lacks,his wife is a little more than he bargained for
1,why did i care about the characters,why does this movie have to be seen

1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to agree,i do n't think it is the best of the series but
1,mistress and sister is the best movie i have ever seen and i think,mistress of the dragon is a very good movie with a great cast
1,the movie is a bit too much of an achievement but it 's a great movie,the movie is about a young boy named kenny who lives on a farm with his mother
1,i was surprised to see that this was a movie about the holocaust,i was expecting the usual horror movie to get excited but the story was
1,william wyler is a genius as the director and writer,william powell is one of the greatest actors in history history

1,meanwhile he is the one who gets the job,meanwhile the movie 's main protagonist 's daughter is killed

1,what is more interesting about this movie,what 's worse the acting and the plot
1,i was surprised by the ending of this movie,i do not know how to make a movie
1,during the course of the film the viewer is left wondering how the people who made this movie were n't aware of the,during the first half the movie is set in a brothel where the film is filmed in the middle of the desert
1,the film is a bit slow but it is still a,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,luke wilson was the only actor who had a role in the movie but he was a bit too old to play,luke goss plays the role of an old man who has a heart transplant that he has been trying to protect
1,the film is about a man trying to get his hands on a man 's death,the story of a woman and the son who have been cheating on their husbands and their
1,i was surprised by the way the story unfolded,i do n't know how it 's going to end
1,the film has some nice moments,the film 's main flaw is that
1,yes i do n't know what the hell i was thinking but i was,yes there 's plenty of action in the movie but it is n't
1,however i was n't expecting much more from it,however the film is not a complete failure as it
1,it was a good idea to show a little more of what i would have done,it 's a great film and a must watch for anyone interested in the genre
1,sure there is a lot of nudity,sure it 's a little slow and it
1,the movie is very well made,the film has some good points but
1,one of the best movies ever made,one of the most beautiful movies ever made
1,every single character is a stereotype,every time i see this show i
1,so the film goes to hell,so if you 're looking for a
1,in this film the director of the film is a very talented director and writer and writer,in the first film the main characters in this film are a bunch of teenagers who are not
1,by the way i was n't sure what was going on,by the third scene in the movie the viewer is asked to
1,but the real reason why the movie was so good was that it was a little slow,but the movie is a complete bore and the only good part of this movie is the acting
1,i have to say that i was a bit disappointed in the first half,i was surprised to find that the movie is n't really a comedy

1,the film is not as good as it was in the original,the movie has a great deal of suspense and a good plot but
1,in a way this film has a great deal of suspense and the ending is very unexpected,in fact i was n't impressed with the movie because i could not believe that this was the

1,it 's a shame because the movie is so good it is hard to,it 's a shame the rest of the movie has n't been released
1,i do n't want to spoil the movie for you but if you,i have to admit that i was very disappointed in the film
1,and it 's not a movie that you 'll,and the ending is a little too abrupt
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this is the first movie to be released on video
1,well i have to say i was,well it is n't that good
1,for those who do n't like it it is worth seeing,for a film that has to be seen to be believed
1,which is why i love it,which brings us to a few laughs
1,unfortunately this is the first film i,unfortunately it 's not the same
1,the acting is horrible and the acting is horrible,the film is a bit of a mess but i
1,when you see a film like this you 'll be surprised,when the movie was released i thought that it was going to
1,my friend and i were laughing hysterically during the whole movie,my friend and i were watching this movie and we were talking
1,what is the deal with the story,what a waste of a film
1,but the film is n't a complete mess,but the film 's main flaw is that it
1,as for the story it 's not a bad movie,as for the story it 's a very good movie to
1,the acting is very good and the story is very well done,the acting was good but the story was weak and the story was
1,my only criticism was that the story is n't a good one but it was a good movie,my friend and i rented the video for this movie and i was n't expecting a lot
1,fair enough to make a good movie but the film is not as bad as the first one,fair enough for this film to be the most expensive movie i 've ever watched and i have to
1,i was n't impressed by the story,i was expecting a lot of action movies
1,if you 're not familiar with the book this film is a must,if you have n't seen the movie you 'll be very disappointed
1,it is the story of the relationship between the two and the two men who are,it is a movie that has a lot of laughs and a lot of laughs
1,we are not talking about this movie and the plot is n't a bad one but it is a great movie,we have a very young woman who has been in the past of her life and is being raised by the other
1,the acting is horrible the script is,the movie is very well done
1,again the movie was a bit too long for me,again it was a great show and i would recommend it
1,i do n't understand why they did n't have to make it into a movie,i think the movie has a great cast and it is not just a collection of
1,on the other hand the movie is a complete,on the whole the story was very interesting
1,for the rest of us who would have thought that the film was a bit more interesting it would have been,for those who have n't read the book i think that the film was a waste of time and money
1,some of the scenes in the movie are just plain awful,some of the scenes are so ridiculous that i could n't believe
1,hands down the worst film ever,hands down a lot of the movie
1,which is a shame because i have seen,which is why i love this movie
1,then the movie goes on and on about how the story is going to end with the characters being,then the two meet a couple of the characters and they get a little too much for it
1,some of the acting is bad but it 's not that good,some of these are some of the most memorable and funniest moments in
1,the film is a complete bore,the story is very simple but not
1,i was surprised that i had n't watched this show,i have n't read the book but i have seen it
1,i do not know why i have n't read the book but this movie was a,i have seen this movie and have been looking forward to seeing a good movie
1,this film is a must see for any movie buff,this is the first movie that i have ever seen
1,i do n't know what this movie has to,i have seen the original version of it
1,this movie is a must see for,this is a very bad movie
1,sirk 's direction is the only thing to do with the story,sirk 's direction is very strong and the film does n't have a
1,it 's a very bad movie,it 's a pity the film never
1,he has a lot of problems with his wife who 's been,he 's a great actress and he 's a good actor
1,of course the story was not so bad it 's good and it 's good to see,of course the story was n't that great but i liked the characters and the characters
1,the film has a great story line and the acting is great,the movie is a bit slow moving and not a great one
1,he is a great director and a very good film but he 's not a bad,he is a great actor who is not a bad guy but a good guy
1,12 the story of the movie revolves around the lives of,12 the movie 's plot line is a little confusing
1,spoilers ahead it 's not a great movie but the acting,spoilers ahead i have a soft spot for a film
1,i do n't want to spoil it for you but i 'll,i have seen this movie and i still remember the movie
1,can the director be able to get the director out,can the director please tell me that the director has done
1,during the course of the movie we get to see the main character tamura,during the movie i had to see the movie to see how it was going
1,i have seen this movie twice and never really tire of it,i do n't think it was a great movie but the acting was
1,or the fact that the movie was shot in the same way as the,or maybe he 's just trying to be too hard to get it
1,for a while the film is a bit too slow,for those who have n't watched the film and have seen
1,romero 's direction is very good as is the cinematography and the performances of the characters are all fine and the film is well,romero 's character is a bit too onedimensional but the story is so full of holes that it 's almost impossible to follow
1,i have never heard of this movie before,i have n't seen the film yet but still
1,he was a great actor and i,he is a very talented actor
1,see this one and you 'll see why,see it if you can find it
1,the film is about a young woman named caroline who is,the film is not a documentary it 's a documentary
1,one thing i did like about it was the fact that the actors did,one of the best things of the film is its lack of realism
1,his performance is so bad he 's almost unrecognizable,his character is the only one who is able to
1,happy gilmore was a very funny and funny movie,happy gilmore is a very good film and it 's
1,also i have to admit that the movie,also the movie is n't even funny
1,i do n't think that the director should have had a,i was expecting something like a remake of this one
1,the acting is good and the story is a little too,the movie is not about the people that they are
1,there 's a lot of nudity in this,there 's a lot more to it
1,these guys have a lot of fun with their characters but the story line is so stupid that i do n't,these are the two things that i do like the first time i saw this i was in my seat
1,as a result of the fact that they are not the only ones who are willing to accept the fact,as the movie goes along it 's a pity that this movie did n't get the recognition it deserved
1,i was expecting a good movie and i could have done a better,i think the director should be ashamed to have seen this movie
1,japan has a very good story line and a,japan 's war is not a bad thing
1,yes it 's a little dated and the acting is n't as bad as some,yes the movie was pretty good but the movie was not really worth it
1,after all this is an action film,after all these years of watching this film
1,in this case it seems that the filmmakers have decided to make a movie about a,in fact it has a lot to say and does not have any redeeming qualities

1,being the first movie i saw that this was not a bad movie but a great story,being a fan of the genre i can only assume that it would be better to see a
1,if you are looking for a movie that is so bad you ca n't even get to,if you 're a fan of the original you might want to check out the movie
1,it 's a very good film and it is a very enjoyable,it was a waste of a great story and good directing

1,the story is about a group of people who have a relationship with a,the film was shot on location and the camera angles were very good
1,that is why i gave this movie a 2,that was the only part i could n't stand
1,but it is not a movie for the whole family,but i have to admit that the film has an interesting

1,riding a bike and a car chase ensues,riding lessons are the most glaring and the most
1,as a fan of the original series i was delighted to see the original,as a movie it is not a movie that you 'll see again
1,oh and the ending is just as good,oh yeah the story is a bit of an
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's not a good film,the film is not a complete mess but it 's a great film
1,she 's a little too old to,she has to be a woman
1,seeming to be a little too much to ask for,seeming to be the only thing that kept me interested
1,the movie is not as good as it was in 1982 but the film is,the film is a little slow and it does n't have a happy ending

1,that 's the problem with the film,that is why the show was so popular
1,at first i was n't sure what to expect,at the end when the movie was made in a
1,in fact i would n't have been surprised to find out that the director of this film had,in the end it 's a good movie but not a movie that is not worth watching

1,but the film is so bad that i could n't stop laughing,but i do have some complaints that the story line is not as
1,if you want to see an entertaining horror flick this movie is for you,if you want to see a movie about the hardships of a family that are
1,simply a film for the fans who like to be entertained by the fact that they are so good and that the film is,simply put this film was one of the best in the genre and it 's one of the best movies of all time

1,it was the worst film i have,it 's not even worth renting
1,this was a very good movie,this is one of the best movies
1,look at the way that the director is trying to,look at the cast and crew and the actors
1,among the best i 've ever seen this is a film that i would recommend to anyone,among the many of the most memorable movies i have ever seen the acting is superb
1,even though i have a soft spot for this movie i have to admit it,even the actors who seem to have been in the film are the same
1,then i saw this film and it was a great movie,then the movie starts to drag and the characters get to be
1,if you have n't seen it yet you should be warned,if i could find it anywhere in the middle of a pack
1,this movie is a great example of how to make a movie and,this film is a must see for all fans of the genre
1,under the circumstances of the movie 's title the movie is a little bit of a mess but it 's still a good film,under the guise of an old friend the film settles around and is trying to get the audience to believe that he is going to
1,although the plot is not a little bit of a twist it still is,although the movie has some good points the movie has some good points
1,several of us have seen this movie and we are still in the mood of our lives,several scenes are cut to a point that you feel that you 're watching the film for a

1,this is a great film and i would definitely recommend it to,this is a very funny film and one of the best
1,and the film is a little bit too long,and that 's not what i thought was the worst

1,the story is a little weak and the characters are n't fleshed out,the film is a little slow but the ending is a bit ambiguous and
1,nicholas cage was a great choice for the role of a lifetime,nicholas cage 's performance in the film is a bit too wooden
1,meekly the movie has a few good points and is not just about the same thing that 's happening in this movie it 's,meekly the story is about a young man who is trying to solve his past to find a job in a small town
1,but this is not the case with the rest,but the movie has a very good story
1,and that 's what it is like,and the movie has no real story
1,notice the fact that the story was not the same,notice that the movie is n't a bad movie and the

1,greedy is the best of all of the three,greedy and the film is not about a young man
1,the movie is a bit slow moving and the story is too thin,the film is about a young man who goes on a journey to the
1,there 's a lot of good stuff to be found in this film and it 's a great story,there is a reason why i gave this movie a 2 out of 10 it was a total waste of
1,i have never seen such a bad film in my,i do n't know how to describe the film

1,i'm a sucker for the movie and this,i'm a big fan of the original
1,because of this movie i have to say that i did n't like it,because of the lack of a good plot it 's not a bad movie
1,this is a movie that is a waste of time and money,this is the kind of movie that you would n't want to miss
1,after the movie was made the film was shot in a very small budget and the actors were n't in the film,after seeing the movie i had a hard time believing that the film was going to suck so much i wanted to be
1,he is also the most annoying actor,he 's a very nice guy

1,sane people who are in the film business are the ones who,sane characters and situations and the film is a complete bore
1,presumably the movie is a bit too long,presumably the film has a very good script and
1,but i was not impressed with the film as i would have,but i think that 's the best part of the movie
1,steven seagal is the only one who manages to,steven spielberg is the best of the three
1,so the movie is n't that bad,so the story is about a young girl
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful the special effects are worse than the,the movie is not a comedy but it 's a comedy that is funny
1,i have never heard of this movie,i have seen this movie several times and
1,the movie was n't bad at all,the film has a lot of good moments
1,i was expecting a movie to be a little bit of fun,i do n't understand why the movie has so much promise
1,if the movie does n't make any sense it 's just plain boring,if you have a masochistic fascination with the story of the film then i
1,bernard 's character is not a good one,bernard and the stranger are the best in the
1,but the story line is so bad,but it is a good movie
1,i'm not a fan of this kind of thing but i think that the,i'm not going to go into detail about the story and the characters
1,as for the acting it was very good,as for the rest of the movie i think
1,not to mention the fact that this film is not a complete disaster,not only does he make a good deal but it 's not a bad
1,while the film is a bit slow it is a bit slow at times and,while it is n't as good or better it is not even that great
1,by the time the film was over i was a little confused,by the time the credits rolled out i was convinced of the film

1,as a matter of fact there is no real reason to be involved in this movie,as for the rest of it i think that it is not a good movie
1,but it 's a good movie and i recommend this movie to all,but i do n't think that this movie is a masterpiece of its own

1,what i got was a movie that was n't a complete failure but a very funny one,what a shame this is not a movie about a group of men who get together
1,the story is about the adventures of three people in the city and the hardships,the film has a few moments of suspense but the movie has no substance
1,it 's just a bunch of bad people trying to,it 's not even the worst of the series
1,for me the most memorable thing about this movie is,for me the film is a very good one
1,probably the best of the series,probably one of the worst movies i
1,take a few steps away from the film,take it for what it 's worth but it
1,the acting is pretty awful and i do n't really know where to start,the film is about the power of a man who is a woman and a

1,and it does have a lot of potential,and i have to admit it was a good
1,i do n't think that this is a good example of how,i was expecting a movie about the holocaust of the holocaust

1,keep it from the other side,keep the movie at all costs
1,she is a very beautiful actress who is a real pleasure,she has to be one of the best characters ever to grace

1,i was surprised that the film was n't a complete waste,i have to say i was impressed with the film
1,it is a shame the film has such a wide range,it 's not even the best of the three films
1,therefore this is the only time i,therefore the story is very good

1,why is n't this one a sequel,why did n't he do that

1,she was the only one who had to deal with her and her,she was n't the least bit of a loser in the film
1,as the film goes on the movie ends up being a very boring movie,as for me i have a problem with the film and the fact that it
1,which was n't a good thing,which is the only thing that is

1,unlike the original it is still very enjoyable,unlike the original film the characters were not developed
1,i was so bored when i watched this,i do n't know what to say
1,noticing it was n't a movie,noticing that the film has a great
1,i do n't think that the movie is worth watching,i do n't know how many people who liked this movie
1,this film is not for everyone who enjoys watching a movie,this is a great film and i highly recommend it to any
1,in a nutshell the story is very good and it is a good movie,in fact the whole movie is just a bunch of random people talking about the
1,sorry i do not want to give it a try but i do not think the director should,sorry for the fact that it 's a film for the ages of the late 80 's
1,how could they have done it,how did the producers think they were
1,but i do have the feeling that,but it was a good movie
1,here 's the plot the acting is terrible the script is bad the,here we have the film that will be a lot more enjoyable
1,15 minutes later i was just waiting to watch this movie,15 years later i saw a preview that said this is one
1,i was n't really impressed with the film because,i was n't expecting a lot of this
1,as the film progresses it begins to fall into the hands of the director of,as a result of his life he is able to get the job done
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is a little slow but
1,despite this it 's not as good as it 's the best of its kind,despite the fact that he is n't a bad guy he 's not a bad guy
1,ultimately this film does n't have any of its moments and the result is a poor one,ultimately the plot is very simple and there 's a lot of action to be found here
1,the acting is horrible the plot is bad the acting is worse,the film 's plot is a mess of the original film
1,this movie has a great cast and i really loved it,this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a
1,ok so the movie was a bit of a bore,ok i do n't know why i did n't watch this
1,bell 's father has been killed by a werewolf who has a secret admirer of his family,bell 's father is a man with a gift for a man who has a heart of gold
1,this was a great movie and i,this movie is a complete mess
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on dvd or vhs,it 's a shame that the movie has not been released on video
1,probably the best of all the blackadder films,probably the worst thing i have ever seen
1,i have to admit i am not one to judge this film as a comedy but i do n't want to give,i have n't read the novel but i think that it is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,love is the best thing about the movie,love is the most important thing about this movie
1,when the movie is n't over the top it is not a bad movie,when i saw this movie i had to watch a movie about a young man
1,black and white is a film that is a mustsee for all ages of the time,black and white are the only ones in the movie that are very well made
1,there 's a lot of action in this movie,there was a lot of action and some good action
1,apart from the fact that the story line is n't really that,apart from that the movie is a total waste of time
1,gay men are not the only ones who are not a little bit attracted by the way they are in the film,gay men are not the only people who can relate to the world and the people they are trying to portray
1,the film is not a complete waste of time,the film has a very interesting story but is so
1,my favorite parts of the show include tony todd and his wife who has a,my favorite scene is when the girl is talking about her mother 's death
1,his character was so unlikable and so unlikable that i was rooting for the character to die,his character is so believable that he is so likable and funny that it 's funny
1,and i have to agree with the other reviewer who commented on the acting the script,and it 's the worst movie i 've seen since the days of the jackal
1,after seeing the movie the only thing that i can,after the movie i had to see the film
1,the movie is a little bit boring and the acting is terrible,the film has a very interesting plot and some great acting
1,that 's what i got from the movie,that 's the best part of this movie
1,without any doubt the worst movie ever made in the world,without a shadow of the doubt the best movie i 've ever
1,the film was shot in black and white with the grainy camera work,the movie is very funny and the story is very well done
1,even when i was a kid it was a waste of time,even the most ardent of the characters in this film is n't a
1,and it 's not a bad film,and the ending is so predictable that you
1,it is a very good movie,it was a waste of time
1,plus it 's a good idea for a movie and,plus the film was a complete waste of time
1,if you 're a fan of the original then you will love the movie,if you want to know the real world of this movie you 'll probably like
1,everyone else is just plain stupid,everyone involved in this film should be
1,probably the only reason why i gave it a 3,probably the best thing to do in this movie
1,i think that 's why it 's not a bad film,i have seen this movie many times and it still holds up
1,take a look at the film and see the film,take the movie for what it is a fun and entertaining
1,just like in the other films of this genre it is a bit of a stretch for a lot,just a few examples of the film that were made for me and the ending was very good
1,read the book instead of seeing a movie about a woman who has a boyfriend who is,read the book and see what it means to be an important part of the book
1,as the film goes on its entirety is the same as the other two films,as for the rest of this film it 's just a bunch of random people trying
1,heck i do n't know what to say about this film,heck it 's not a movie for you to watch
1,the unguarded is one of the best films ever made,the unguarded is a great film that is a joy to
1,i have seen a lot of other films,i think the film is quite good
1,the movie has a lot of action and the plot is very simple,the film is not a documentary it is a study of a man 's
1,it is the best thing i have seen in a long time,it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's definitely not
1,but the film is not so bad it 's funny,but the story was so predictable that i could barely care
1,i do think the movie was made up of a lot of,i was surprised by the amount of violence in this movie
1,robert duvall as the evil and psychotic sheriff was also,robert englund is the perfect choice for this movie
1,but it was a good idea to get to the point where,but the film is so bad that it becomes unintentionally laughable
1,one of the best of the series,one of the most interesting films i have
1,evil dead ii is a movie that has no real plot to speak of,evil dead man is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,the movie was shot at a time in which a film is set in the same location,the film is about a young boy named angus who is visited by an older woman
1,since the movie has a good story it is very hard to believe that this movie is not a comedy,since it was made by a group of friends who were in the military and have to be the only ones
1,then the story of a woman who is a woman and is a woman,then the film starts to drag and the characters are all over the place and
1,no wonder it is n't available on video for purchase on vhs for sale and,no one is going to get a chance to see him in anything else
1,most of the movie is a flashback sequence,most of the movie is shot in a small
1,apparently this movie was made for tv,apparently the movie has a lot of action
1,i was expecting the worst film i 'd ever seen,i was n't sure why i was watching this movie
1,she 's not a bad person,she is not in the movie but
1,the movie starts out with a bang of the first two thirds,the story is about a bunch of people who have a relationship with
1,yes the film is not a comedy but it is a good film to watch and it 's not a great,yes i have to say that the movie has a few funny moments but overall i found it very funny
1,seldom have i seen a movie where i could not,seldom have i been so disgusted by this movie
1,a lot of the humor in this movie is just plain stupid,a lot of people have commented on this film but the fact that
1,made in the late 1940s and early seventies it 's,made in 1987 the movie is very well made
1,but the movie is n't as good as the first film but it is,but the story was very interesting and it was n't a bad film
1,in fact i think the movie would be a lot better,in the end it was a great movie that i would recommend
1,but this one was a lot of fun,but the movie does n't make any sense whatsoever
1,there is a reason to be the movie,there 's no real reason for this
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful,the film is a very good movie
1,i think it 's the worst film i 've ever seen,i do not know what to say about this movie but i
1,instead it was a complete waste of time,instead we get the usual annoying and annoying looking
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the film has a very strong plot
1,i was n't really impressed by the,i was surprised by this movie
1,but it 's still a great movie,but it is not the worst
1,the movie is very funny and it,the film is a complete bore
1,but it 's a good movie to have a good time with it and you,but the film is so good that it 's hard to watch this movie
1,congratulations to the director for giving the movie a chance,congratulations to the director for the great and wonderful performances of
1,they 're not even close to the original,they are not the same people who have seen
1,i have never been more angry and i do not know what to do,i was n't really sure if this was a comedy but it is a fun
1,now the story is n't that bad,now i have a lot more to say
1,a lot of the film 's plot is told by a group of people who are trying to get a good amount of money and the money is n't the same,a lot of the movie 's characters are introduced as the characters and their motivations and the plot is so predictable that it is impossible to care for the characters
1,he is a good actor and he 's not the worst actor in the movie,he is a great actor and he is a great actor in the movie
1,watch it and you will have to see it to believe it,watch out for the scene where the two men meet the two lovers
1,overall it was n't that good,overall it 's a pretty good film
1,many of them have a certain amount of time to do,many of the other actors are good but the story is so
1,there are a few moments that are n't very funny and i think,there is nothing in this film that makes me want to vomit
1,i do n't know if i should be able to get my hands on a copy of this film but,i do n't think that it was a good idea to make a movie about a bunch of kids
1,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's bad,it 's not that the story is bad but it 's a good
1,unfortunately the story was n't too original and the ending did n't really fit into,unfortunately this movie was so bad i had to watch it to find it
1,if you 're looking for a film that will be a,if you have n't seen this movie i recommend it
1,in fact the movie has some very interesting scenes but the story is so weak,in the end he is n't the only one who is n't the only one
1,while i am not a huge fan of the genre i have to say i was a bit surprised,while the film is not as bad as the first one it is still a very good one
1,henry fonda is a great actor but,henry fonda is a fine actor
1,under the guidance of the director 's name of the movie i was surprised to find out that the movie was a complete waste,under the circumstances the movie is a bit of a mess but it is a good family movie that is n't afraid of the audience
1,there are many things that are missing in this movie,there 's no need for this film to be made
1,george c scott is great in his role as a young girl,george c scott is a great actor and he 's a good actor
1,you can tell that the director is trying to,you know what to do with the plot
1,written by the great chris penn,written by a very young man in
1,the movie is a bit slow at,the film is a complete mess
1,in the end it 's just another bad bad movie,in the first film he was in fact a bit of
1,the acting is very good and the story is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad thing,the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous the acting is worse the story is awful the acting is bad and the
1,dvd purchase is the best of its kind,dvd has been a classic since the original film
1,when the film is released it is a movie that is not a complete disaster,when the movie is over you 're not sure what the real thing is
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't get the recognition it,i think the film was very well done with the actors
1,jeffrey tambor is one hell of a good actor but he 's,jeffrey combs is a great actor and is a great actor
1,mother of the murdered husband is an ambitious movie,mother of the bitch is a very funny movie that
1,enter a group of people who have been killed and killed,enter a group of people from a small town to a local
1,it 's not that i do n't want a movie to,it was a great film and the acting was excellent
1,but the film is n't as bad it 's actually quite a bit too long and it is n't even,but the film 's plot and characters are so weak that it 's almost impossible to make a movie
1,or even that was a good idea,or is it the same thing
1,however the movie is very good,however the film is a little too
1,being that the film is not a complete waste of time and money it,being that the film is a bit long it 's still very funny
1,effective acting by all concerned and great performances by the two leads,effective and interesting the first is the most beautiful film in the history
1,but i think the film 's best asset was that it had a lot of potential and,but it 's a good movie and it 's a great film for the whole family
1,the film is very well directed but it 's not the best movie ever made,the film is about a group of young adults who are invited to spend their vacation
1,however it 's a shame that the film has n't been remastered,however the movie is a little too long to be enjoyed
1,trying to get to a point where the story takes place,trying to find a way to make it into the big leagues
1,his wife is a little too old for,his character is not a bad guy
1,the movie is a bit long but i,the movie is a very good one
1,torn up from the first movie the movie is a very bad movie and the acting is,torn between the three men is the most beautiful character in the history of cinema history
1,maybe it 's because of a very poor script but the,maybe he was just a little too much to bear
1,filled with a few moments of humour and a few scenes you 'll find the story of the film a little bit more enjoyable than,filled with great acting great acting and great music this is a must see for any fan of the original and i love lucy
1,nothing happens and i think it is a very,nothing is a good thing for a movie
1,we have a movie that is not only one of the,we get a glimpse of the characters in this film
1,the film is about the man 's life and his life,the acting is very good the story line is good the acting
1,the movie starts off as a comedy but the characters do n't seem to,the film has some very good performances and it has some good points
1,he is a good actor but he is a good actor,he 's the only one who has to contend with the other
1,perhaps the director was trying to make it a little bit more realistic,perhaps it was the fact that the film was made to be a little
1,if you want to watch a movie about an assassination attempt you can,if you 're a fan of the series you will like this
1,nbc 's movies are a lot better,nbc has a lot of potential
1,like many others this is the best,like many of these movies i think that
1,seriously the movie is n't even worth a watch,seriously this is one of those movies that is so
1,this is not the case in this movie but,this is not a movie to be missed
1,they were all in the same room with the same old,they are both funny and the story is so good
1,it is the most powerful movie ever,it is a movie with no redeeming qualities
1,there is no real reason for that,there is no real reason for this film
1,i do n't understand what this movie is about and it 's a shame because it is a movie,i have to admit that i did not enjoy this movie because i had to sit through it
1,final fantasy viii is a great show,final verdict the movie is a bit long
1,as a result the story of a girl who has a boyfriend who is in love with a woman is just,as a result of the movie 's popularity the movie has a very good plot and the acting is excellent
1,this movie is not for everyone but it is,this is a movie i have seen before
1,i was surprised to learn that this movie was n't released on,i was surprised that the movie did not get released theatrically
1,i was so disappointed that i could n't get into the story,i was n't expecting anything else from a film but it 's a
1,i'm glad i did n't have a copy of this movie,i'm sure it would be more interesting to see the film in
1,the story is about a group of people who have to deal with a group of strange murders,the film is about two men who are married to each other and each other in their own way
1,the acting is good and the story is good,the story is a little confusing at times and is
1,hence the movie is a little too long,hence that 's the only reason why i gave
1,i think the director was trying to make a statement about a character that is so stupid and so stupid,i do n't know what the point of this movie was but it was a total waste of my time and
1,one can only imagine that they were not in the,one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,he was n't a good actor,he is the only character he can
1,this movie has been made by people with a lot of money but,this is one movie you should watch and i recommend to everyone
1,my advice for the movie is to be made in the first place,my only problem with this film is that the director has n't even managed
1,and the movie does not have to be a,and the ending was a bit too predictable
1,a very good film that is n't even worth watching,a few minutes into the movie i realized that this is
1,infants who are in this film should be embarrassed,infants who are n't in the movie are n't the
1,for the first half of the film it 's a bit too long,for a movie that is supposed to be a comedy it is a very
1,santiago has to go to a party and he 's a little too old for his part,santiago is the only person who has ever been in a movie that has been made to entertain
1,it 's not a bad movie,it was a good movie and the
1,it 's a shame because the film was shot in a very tight manner that made it difficult to see what was going on,it 's not a bad film it 's not a bad one but it is still a good horror film and i would recommend it
1,i was n't really surprised at all,i was n't expecting a lot of this
1,the film is a bit slow but it does n't really work,the movie starts out very promising and the story is very interesting but
1,the film has a very strong plot and a good plot,the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable that it
1,the film is not a bad film it 's a very bad film with no redeeming value,the film is not as polished and as it seems a little bit too dark for the first
1,that was the only reason that i had seen the movie in,that is the only way you 'll ever see this film
1,the film is not a comedy but a comedy,the film was shot on location in the early 1900
1,this film was a complete waste of time and money,this is not the case with a bad movie
1,jim carrey is a fine actor but he does n't have,jim carrey is the best actor in the whole cast
1,he was the first one to get the job of the world,he is the only one who has a chance to make a good
1,we get a glimpse of the characters who are so unlikable and the characters that are so obvious that,we are supposed to feel like you 've just seen the first movie in a series of movies
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie it makes it a waste,there 's a lot of good things to be said about this film
1,and that 's why this film is not,and the film does not have to rely on
1,it 's not a good movie,it is a great movie to watch
1,the film is a bit long but it is not a good movie,the acting was terrible the script was awful the direction awful the script was
1,punches the hell out of me that is,punches the hell out of your audience
1,what is the deal with the film and,what a waste of time and money
1,the film is a complete mess of a movie,the story is very simple and the acting is superb
1,i'm a big fan of the series but this one was just so bad,i'm a sucker for the movie and the fact that it is a film that
1,or the fact that the movie is so bad and so stupid that you can only watch,or the fact that the film is so bad that you 're actually laughing out loud
1,she is the only character that could have done,she was the best thing to be done
1,isolated from a very good movie by john woo,isolated from the first movie and then the second half
1,just like the first movie it 's just a bad movie,just as a man who has been living in a small town
1,the film has an underlying message to the,the movie is a very good one
1,that 's why i think the director should be ashamed of,that 's a good thing to say about this film
1,individual 's performance in the movie is a bit of a joke,individual 's character was a bit more interesting than the other actors
1,jill 's father is a very nice guy,jill and her boyfriend are a bunch of people
1,only the first 15 minutes of the film is a little too long,only a couple of scenes are worth the time and money to pay to
1,i do n't think that the movie was made in the us,i have seen the film and i have n't read the book
1,there 's also a very good scene when,there is nothing to recommend this film
1,at the end of the film the viewer is treated to a very very very long respite from the story,at the end when a movie is made of the same sort of thing as the first one and the second
1,most of the time it 's not a bad movie,most of the time it is a very poor film
1,especially the final confrontation between the two men is a bit too much,especially the first time i saw this movie i had a blast
1,its not even the good of the barrel and the movie is a bit,its a shame that the film is n't available on dvd or vhs
1,only a few minutes into the movie,only the acting is n't bad
1,so the movie is not as good as it was in the first place,so the film is a little slow but it 's still a fun movie to
1,all in all it is a very good and interesting film,all in all a good movie but not a bad movie
1,i was n't impressed with the story,i was surprised to see the movie in
1,the film is a bit long but the story and,the movie was shot in a very tight way
1,ms smith is one of her finest and she,ms and his friends is a great movie
1,objects are the best thing to be seen,objects and the beast are the same as the
1,these two characters have their own problems and the story is a little,these are the kind of things that make the movie so bad
1,there was a good reason to watch this movie,there are some very interesting scenes in this movie but
1,it 's a shame that the producers did n't have,it 's the only reason to watch this movie
1,we have a lot of action in this movie,we get a glimpse of how to get a job
1,a few minutes later i was n't bored,a few years after the movie 's release i
1,the acting is good but i think the script was a bit too weak,the film has a very interesting plot and the actors are all very good and
1,there are some great scenes of this film and the film is a,there are some funny scenes but they just do n't work out
1,it was the worst thing i 've ever seen on film,it 's a shame that this movie was n't made available on
1,we are supposed to be rooting for her,we are shown in the background and it 's
1,the acting is pretty bad and the,the film is not a comedy
1,even if the film is a bit long it is still a fun film,even if the film does n't have the feel of a movie it would have
1,inspite of this the movie is very well done,inspite of that the film is a total waste of
1,when i first saw this movie in the theater i thought it was a very,when i first watched this film i thought it was a pretty decent thriller
1,and the acting is so bad that,and it is not a film
1,i was n't impressed at all,i was n't expecting much of a
1,even the actors are so stupid,even though the film was shot in
1,jet li is a great actor,jet li plays the lead character who
1,did i mention the fact that the story is,did they really need to make the movie
1,and the acting was n't as bad as i expected,and it is a very nice movie to watch
1,music and dance numbers is very well done,music is a very good one as is the
1,the film is about two young men who are,the movie is a little over the top
1,the acting and the story is very good,the acting is horrible the plot is awful
1,too much of the same time as this one and that was n't the only,too bad it was n't even nominated for a academy award for best screenplay
1,returning home is an excellent film that i can watch over and over again,returning to the film i thought it was a good idea to get a good
1,the film 's main flaw of the film is that its not a good movie,the film 's premise is that it 's a very good idea to be taken from
1,only a few scenes are funny,only one thing i noticed was the
1,i was n't sure if this was a bad film or not but i think,i was n't really expecting a good movie but this one is just bad
1,one of the most underrated movies of the,one of the worst movies ever made
1,they 're not funny but they are fun,they have to be one of the most annoying
1,a few of the other actors have been in this film and i have to say that i,a lot of the scenes are filmed in the movie and the actors are very very good
1,you know the kind of person that 's supposed to have a bad day at the end,you have to watch this movie to find out if it 's a good film or a good
1,i have seen the movie several times and i have to agree that i am a big fan,i have never seen the film so i ca n't wait until i can buy the dvd
1,some scenes are just plain stupid,some of the scenes were just plain
1,just like in the other two films,just as you would expect it to be
1,i was surprised by the way the story was told and i thought the acting,i do n't know what it 's about but it was a good film
1,there is also a lot of nudity in the movie,there 's a lot of action and some action
1,this was the only time i saw,this movie is a must see
1,i do n't know why i did n't watch the movie because i,i was n't expecting anything else but i was n't expecting much
1,the film was shot in the early seventies,the film is a bit of a mess but
1,this film does not have to be a movie,this is a very bad attempt to cash in on
1,for those interested in the subject of the film it may be a bit too difficult,for the most part this is a great movie for those who enjoy the genre
1,there is no plot and no character development,there was a lot of action in this film
1,why do they make this movie that they,why does n't he just kill her
1,its the best movie i have ever seen,its a great film for a rainy sunday afternoon
1,nevertheless this is a great example,nevertheless it 's a good thing
1,let 's just say that it was n't a movie that i would n't,let me just say this is the best movie i have ever seen
1,my favorite character was a man,my advice for this film was to
1,though it 's not as good as it is in the movie it does n't have to be the best,though it 's a little dated it 's not as bad as some other movies from the same period
1,yes i know that the film does not have to do with the book but it is a good film,yes it is true that the film is a little slow at times but it is a good movie
1,there are many things that make this movie a little more interesting,there are a lot of things that make you think and feel good
1,this movie has a good cast but,this movie is not for everyone
1,sadly it 's not as bad as it 's been made,sadly the movie is a little too long and boring
1,why did n't they have a party in the,why is n't he just a bad guy
1,and that 's the whole point of this film,and it 's the best thing i 've seen in
1,i was n't impressed by it and i do n't think it was that much,i have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time
1,however the film is not a complete waste of time it is n't,however i was n't sure if it was a comedy or a drama
1,while i do n't think i have any complaints on this one i would say,while it was n't the most original film it was still a good film

1,hogan is a great character actor,hogan 's character is the most likable
1,there are a few good things about the movie but it 's a,there 's also some very interesting and interesting moments in the film
1,in a way it is a little more than just a movie,in a nutshell the movie was shot with the same exact story
1,i think this is one of the best of the series,i was n't expecting a lot of the movie and i did
1,the movie is a complete mess and the ending is just too stupid to be enjoyable,the movie is a little bit too slow for me but i think that it is not
1,she is a beautiful woman who is a woman and a womanizer,she 's a great actress and she is very good here

1,i do n't know what to say about the story,i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie was
1,all i can say is that it was a waste of my time,all of the actors and actresses in the movie were very good
1,other than that it 's a great film and a good movie to watch,other than a brief cameo by david lynch who is in the film for a
1,the film is not as good as the first one but the story is so bad that it 's almost,the movie starts off with a very long shot and then a few shots of the camera pans off
1,i was n't sure what the point of the movie,i do n't know why this movie has such a low
1,i do n't want to give away any,i do agree with the previous comment
1,in a way this is the most important aspect of the story the story is,in the meantime the movie was made for a very limited amount of money
1,this film is a great example of how to use the word to describe how a film can be,this is a movie that is n't even worth watching for the sheer laughs that it 's getting
1,the film is a very interesting one at that,the movie starts out with a group of men trying
1,this movie is a must see,this is one of my favorite movies
1,this is one of the best movies ever,this movie is not worth a watch
1,we have a movie about the lives of the people in the movie industry and the people involved in their lives and their lives,we are supposed to be rooting for a character who is supposed to be a good guy but he does n't want to do that
1,it 's a shame to hear that this is a sequel for the first movie,it is a great film and it is not a great film to watch
1,those of you who have not read the book should be aware of,those who are familiar with the genre are missing out on this
1,skelton 's character is so unlikable that it 's hard to believe,skelton is one of the greatest and most talented comedians ever
1,no one can deny this movie,no wonder the movie is n't so
1,interestingly enough the story is a little too convoluted,interestingly the film is not a total mess
1,this is a very bad film,this film has the same effect as
1,thankfully this movie was made in 1980 it,thankfully it 's not a bad movie
1,the film has some good moments,the movie is a complete mess
1,yet the story is very good,yet the story of the film is
1,there 's no plot no character development,there is no plot no story
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring,the film 's plot is a little weak but
1,this is a great movie to see if you are,this is the first time i saw this movie
1,but i was n't expecting a lot,but the story is n't all that bad
1,sudden impact is the first film that i 've seen in quite some,sudden impact is the first film i 've ever had to watch
1,if you 're a fan of the original you will find this movie very enjoyable and worth checking out,if you 're going to make a movie that is so bad you should not watch this one
1,the film is a bit of a spoof,the film is a very good movie
1,personally i would n't have to watch it to find out if the filmmakers or the director,personally i thought the film was a little too slow and it was n't that good
1,june duprez was a very good choice for the role and the acting,june allyson is one of the best actors ever in this movie
1,but this movie is so bad,but it was n't a bad movie
1,the acting is horrible and there is no real plot to speak of and,the film is about the power of the human spirit of the times
1,it 's a great movie to watch,it 's just not that bad
1,mandy moore is a great actress and i have to say this was one of her first films,mandy moore is a woman who is married to a young man in a mental institution and is forced
1,happy gilmore is one of those films where you do n't want to watch it again,happy gilmore is a very funny show and it is fun to see how many people can
1,yea i know that this film is a complete failure,yea i 've heard that it is a great film
1,secondly it 's just a bad movie,secondly the movie is a complete mess with
1,but it 's not that bad,but it 's a great story that
1,my advice is if you are a fan of the genre this is definitely a movie,my favorite scene is the scene where she is talking about her husband 's death
1,stowaway on a train and a few other people,stowaway on a train and the two men are a
1,all the characters were so bad that they could n't make it any better,all the characters are believable and the plot is so predictable that it 's hard
1,i think that this film is a waste of money and time,i do n't know what to say about this movie but i have
1,a few years ago i saw this movie,a lot of people have commented on the movie
1,wasted on a lot of bad films,wasted time and effort on the dvd
1,when i watched this film i was amazed at the sheer beauty that it was trying,when i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was a good movie
1,and it does n't matter that it,and the ending was so predictable
1,the film was a little too long,the movie is a little over the top
1,i was surprised by this film and i was very impressed with the acting,i do n't know why i did n't see this movie in the theater
1,of course it 's a bit slow but it,of course there is a lot of action
1,sorry to say i do n't know what to say about this,sorry for the fact that i have n't read the book
1,in the end the movie is a very good one,in the end the movie is a little slow but it
1,some scenes are very funny but the movie is so poorly done,some of these are the same people who made this movie a lot
1,unfortunately the film 's only redeeming value is that the film 's,unfortunately i did n't have to pay to rent this movie
1,but it is a great movie to watch and i recommend it to any fan of the genre,but the real reason i gave it the 2 is that it 's a little more than a little
1,what i got was a movie about a,what a waste of time and money
1,the acting is good the script is very good and the,the acting is pretty good and the acting is great
1,this is a very funny movie,this is a movie for the whole
1,but the film 's plot is so bad,but the movie is a complete waste
1,of course the only reason i gave this film a 2 is because it 's just not funny,of course it 's not the same thing that the first two movies have but they 're also good
1,if it was n't for the fact that the film was filmed in the us i would have given it,if i had n't watched it the first time i would have been a big fan of the genre
1,i have seen this one several times over and over and over,i have n't seen this movie since i was a child and was
1,in the end i felt like i was watching the same movie over and over and over and,in this movie the characters are so real and believable that i ca n't help but laugh
1,the movie is about a group of young people who go on a trip to the desert to find the missing,the movie is a little slow but i think it 's a bit of a stretch to be taken seriously
1,despite the fact that the movie was filmed in color and the music score it was a great experience,despite the fact that the movie is based on a novel i do n't know what the film is about
1,what a shame the movie was made on a shoestring budget so i do n't think that this movie was made for tv,what a shame this movie is so poorly written poorly acted and badly written that it does n't even try to redeem the film
1,whereas the story is n't as bad as the original the characters are all pretty good,whereas this movie was n't as good as the first one it 's still very good
1,the movie has an excellent soundtrack,the movie was shot on a shoestring
1,with all the hype surrounding the film and the plot it would be a good one,with all the hype of the movie i would have given it a lower score
1,a lot of people seem to think this is,a few minutes later the story takes place
1,the film is a bit of an action film but it 's still very good,the film 's plot is a bit thin and the story line is very weak and
1,the acting is horrible and the story is so stupid it makes me want to vomit,the film is about a group of four friends who go into a house to assassinate the
1,never before have i seen such a bad movie in my life,never mind that this movie was a waste of my time
1,my favorite scene in the film was the one where the two guys are talking to the guy in,my advice for the film is to get the message of a film that will make you laugh
1,maybe it was the fact that the director did n't know what to do with the script,maybe it was because the movie was so bad that it was just a bad film
1,unfortunately the story is n't that bad,unfortunately the script is not as good
1,when i saw this movie i did not like it,when i first watched this film i thought it was a
1,you can tell the actors were all going through the motions,you know that it 's the best movie that i can remember
1,if it had a good story it would have been a lot more interesting,if you 're looking for a good movie about a man that is a little
1,instead of the usual hollywood fare it was a big disappointment that this is,instead it 's a movie about a man who has been a loner
1,but i was n't expecting much,but the movie does n't work at
1,it is a shame that this was not a film for,it was a great movie and i loved the movie
1,of course there is the possibility of a new version of the story of a man who is a little bit of a loner,of course the movie has some good moments but the story is n't very good and the actors are n't very good either
1,it 's not that i do n't know the exact same thing,it 's a shame because the movie has no redeeming qualities
1,i have to agree with the other reviewer who stated that the movie has some,i have to agree that this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie was not for everyone but if you
1,watch it and then see it,watch this film if you 're a
1,i was n't really sure what to expect,i was so excited to see the first film
1,whilst the film is a bit long it is also very entertaining and a bit of a,whilst the movie does have an interesting premise it 's not a movie that is not
1,but it 's a great film,but it was n't that bad
1,the movie is not about a woman and the girl who 's,the movie has a few good moments but it is not
1,i do n't think it 's a good movie but it is n't,i have to admit that i have seen this film several times and have
1,the film was shot in the early,the film has a great cast
1,well it 's not the first time i saw it,well i guess i 'll never forget the film
1,the film is very well acted and directed,the acting is good and the story is good
1,and the acting was n't that bad,and it 's not a movie for the
1,now i know i have seen a few of the movies that i have seen,now i know that the movie was made on video but i was wrong
1,directed by the director of the original the film is a complete mess,directed by the great alfred hitchcock the only one that i can think of
1,i have n't seen the first movie but i have seen this movie and i do not know what to,i do n't think that the movie is a total waste of film but it is definitely worth watching
1,housing is a very good movie,housing island is a very moving film
1,now that 's a little too much,now i know that the director and producer
1,but the real problem with this movie is the fact that,but it is a good film that you can watch
1,it is a shame to see the,it is a very good movie
1,no one is going to be able to get a job,no matter how much you love it or hate it you 'll
1,bones are a bunch of people who are not afraid to be in the same room,bones is a movie about a bunch of kids who have a lot of fun to get
1,a lot of people have already seen the movie,a few years ago he has been in his late
1,heather 's father was the one who had,heather graham is a very strong actress
1,love is the most important thing to come out of the ordinary and,love and hate are all for the sake of a good story
1,anyway the movie is not a comedy,anyway i was surprised to find out that
1,i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do n't think the director did anything,i was surprised to see that the director did n't have a budget to make the story interesting
1,but i do not want to spoil the film,but it was the worst movie i ever saw
1,i have n't seen this movie yet,i think this movie is a great deal
1,i have to say that this was,i have seen it several times
1,looking for it to be a good,looking for it in the theater
1,what 's the deal with the story,what i found interesting is how many of
1,consider it a good example of what it means to be a movie,consider the fact that the film is so bad it 's good
1,as a matter of fact i did n't like the movie,as the film goes on we are left with a very satisfying
1,for a film that has to be one of the worst i 've ever seen,for those of us who have n't seen it yet you will be able to watch
1,the movie is a little slow but,the movie is not a comedy
1,but it 's just a bad movie,but the film is a little too slow
1,this is not a movie for everyone,this movie is a must see
1,what 's with the other characters in,what a great movie that 's
1,looking at the film and the fact that,looking for it 's a good movie
1,the film was shot in a very cheap and grainy style,the film has a lot of action and it 's a good
1,country is a very good film and it 's a shame that it is still,country of the fireflies is a film that has been forgotten for many years
1,each character has a unique personality and personality,each character has a distinct personality and the film
1,every time she appears on screen it is a joy that the viewer has to identify with,every time the film takes place in a world of its own it is a film about a
1,not that it 's a good film,not to mention that the film is n't
1,lo bianco is a great actor who is a great actor,lo bianco is the only reason to watch this film
1,the movie has a great cast that includes the,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,it is n't that i think it 's a great movie to watch and a good movie but not for everyone,it 's a shame that this movie has been released on dvd so that i can get it on dvd
1,there 's a lot more to say about the movie and the plot,there 's a scene where he 's talking about his wife and he 's
1,the acting was good and the acting was good,the film is not a documentary of the period it
1,he 's a very good actor and i hope his career,he is a great character and he is very believable
1,i think the director 's intention is to make an interesting film,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the film
1,we get a few scenes that were n't so good,we get to see a bunch of people dressed in a
1,what 's more the movie is a masterpiece,what 's the point of this film
1,it 's just a shame that the film is not as bad as the first,it is a shame that this is not a movie for the fans of classic cinema
1,after the first 15 minutes of the film i was n't sure what the point of it,after a few minutes i was left speechless and wondering what the hell was going on
1,it 's a shame to see such a bad film,it was a good idea for a movie and a lot
1,in fact i think the film is a,in fact the movie is so boring
1,it was a waste of money,it 's not even a movie
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money,the film is a little bit too long but it 's
1,oh and the scene where he is supposed to be the one who is the,oh and i did n't care for any of the characters in this movie
1,but the film is a little bit too dark in,but i was n't expecting much of this movie
1,using a lot of the same things happen in this film,using the word loosely to make a film that was a complete
1,i was so disappointed with the movie,i have seen this movie many times in
1,this movie is a must see,this film has a lot of good
1,if you 're going to make a movie about a bunch of kids who have a good time then do,if you 're not a fan or you 're a fan of the original you will probably be disappointed
1,if you 're looking for a movie that is so bad that it makes the viewer think that this,if it was n't for the great acting of the two leads it would be a great film
1,it was n't that great either,it 's a very funny show with
1,i do n't know what the director was trying to do with this movie,i do n't think this movie is a good example of how to make a
1,the film was a waste of time and money,the film is a bit too slow but it does
1,it 's a shame because the story line is n't as good as the first one,it 's just a shame that the film is n't as good as it should have been
1,it is a very good story,it was a very interesting experience to
1,she 's a very good actress and,she is a very talented actress
1,i do n't know how this movie got released theatrically but it is still,i was n't expecting much but i had a good time watching it
1,all in all i was impressed by,all in all a good movie
1,after the first hour i was hooked to it,after all the movie was made in the us it
1,well i guess that 's why i liked it,well the movie was a lot like a lot of
1,the film is not only a visual medium but a very good film,the story line is very good and the story line is very good
1,now this is the best movie i,now that is a good thing
1,a few minutes of my life i 'll never get back,a very funny film that will keep you on the edge of
1,there 's a scene in which he 's talking about,there are a few good moments in this movie
1,films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre' and others have made a great impression,films like this are not only for their own good but to those who
1,taking a look at the movie 's flaws it 's just a shame,taking a look at the film and the fact that it is not the
1,but the real reason for this was the acting by all,but the film has the same effect that i 've seen
1,as a result the film has no redeeming features whatsoever,as for the rest of the cast it is very well
1,overall this is a very entertaining and entertaining,overall it was a pretty good movie
1,but the movie does n't really have a lot of action,but i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie and
1,i do n't think it 's the best film ever made and it 's not even,i was surprised to find that the film did not have a very good cast
1,it 's the same old man who is in the film and,it 's not even a comedy but i found it funny
1,i think it 's one of the most underrated movies ever,i do n't know what the appeal of the movie was
1,and it was a good film to see it was a,and i have n't seen a lot of movies lately
1,all i can say is the movie is a bit slow but it 's still worth,all of the actors are great and i think it 's one of his best
1,as for the story line well it was a little confusing,as for the rest of the movie it is a little too
1,had it been a comedy it would have been a little more enjoyable,had he been in the movie he could have been more believable
1,a few of the characters are so stupid they are funny,a very good movie and a good movie to watch
1,bale plays the part with the best performance in this movie,bale and dunne are a pair of young men who have no
1,and i think it 's a great film to watch,and the film is a complete mess of a film
1,but i do not know what it 's about,but this movie was n't even good enough for me
1,it 's not a great movie and the acting was n't bad either,it 's a very funny movie and i would n't recommend it to any
1,that 's why i think this movie was so bad,that 's why it 's not a bad thing
1,the movie is a bit slow but,the film is a complete failure
1,people have to watch a film that 's a bit like the first one,people who do n't have any idea of how the film is going to be
1,in this case he 's a pretty good character,in the end i found myself wishing that the filmmakers
1,in fact i think the film is a very interesting one and the film,in the first film there are some great actors and a good story
1,jason robards jr is a revelation,jason priestley is a fine actor and
1,i was expecting a lot more than this,i was n't expecting anything more than that
1,she is the only one who seems to,she was so good and so funny
1,other characters are just plain stupid,other than that i was impressed by
1,the acting is good and i have to say i,the movie is not as good as the first
1,well it 's a great movie,well i was n't expecting a great
1,even though the movie was n't bad it,even the acting and direction were terrible
1,i was surprised by the fact that the director was,i was surprised at how much this film sucked
1,decades later when he 's on his first assignment he is confronted with the,decades ago and i still remember it fondly and i still remember that
1,the acting is very good but the plot is weak,the film is about a man who 's trying to get
1,but the film is n't as bad as the,but this is the worst film ever made
1,people have been in town for the past few days now but the movie is still a great one,people who have been in the industry for a long time and are n't afraid of their own
1,over the years i 've seen a lot of,over all this movie is a must see
1,all the characters in this show is very likable,all the characters are likable but the story is so
1,it 's a shame that the movie has been so long,it 's a very good show and it 's a shame that
1,every time the movie is over you will have a headache,every character in the movie is a caricature of the original and
1,definitely the worst movie i have ever seen,definitely not the best movie ever made
1,poorly scripted poorly acted poorly acted,poorly directed acted and acted as if
1,ivanhoe is a movie with great acting and great direction,ivanhoe is one of those rare movies that you can see
1,actually the film is n't bad,actually the movie is a bit slow
1,she is a very talented character,she has a great deal of talent
1,it is not a film for everyone,it was a waste of time and money
1,so if you 're looking for something to watch in the first place then you should see it,so i have to admit that i have seen a few of the other movies that have been released
1,it 's a shame that the director and the director chose to write a movie for,it is a shame that the film is n't as good as the other two
1,but i do n't want to spoil it for you but i have to admit that the,but the story is so weak that it is hard to understand why it was made
1,that 's a shame because the movie is a,that 's why i gave it a 2
1,and it 's a good idea that a,and that 's not what you get
1,another thing that i did n't like about this film was that it was shot,another thing i liked was that the actors had no chemistry in the plot
1,manu is a very beautiful young woman who loves her and she 's a,manu and her husband are in the same predicament as the first one
1,note that this is the first of the series of the series and it shows the same thing as the first one,note that the director has been in the industry and the director and director have a very good time making this film
1,the film 's plot is very thin and the,the movie is a little slow at times
1,as a matter of fact there was no need for this film to be,as a result of the film 's success i was expecting something more
1,traders and other coworkers in the town and,traders are the best of the two
1,the acting was good and the plot was pretty good,the movie is about a young woman who lives with her
1,in the end the movie ends with an abrupt twist ending,in a way i do n't think this is a good film
1,any other person who can see the world should be ashamed and embarrassed to see it,any one who has a problem with this movie is that you do not want to be
1,room of the living dead is one of the best movies,room is a very good film with a great cast
1,however the movie is a little too slow for me,however it was a good idea to make a movie about
1,that is what makes it such a great classic,that is a very good thing because it is so
1,their relationship is not as good but not as good as the first two,their relationship with each other is a bit too sweet and too sentimental for a
1,tending to the fact that it 's a movie that is n't funny and has a lot,tending to this movie 's success is that it 's a little bit of a shame
1,malcolm mcdowell is excellent as the villain but he 's just not convincing,malcolm mcdowell is great as the villain who is a great actor
1,still it is a very good movie to,still it 's a very enjoyable film
1,my advice is to avoid this film like the plague,my favorite scene is when the woman is in a bar
1,the acting was n't as bad as,the movie was a complete disappointment
1,the film 's main flaw is that it,the film is a very good film
1,or maybe he should have done a lot better but he 's not the worst actor,or maybe it was the fact that it had a lot more going on for me than
1,add a few extra twists and turns to make the characters interesting and they make it,add a few touches to the mix and you have a recipe for a movie
1,what i got was something that would be a good thing,what 's worse is that this film has been made in the
1,so the movie starts off with a bang and a few minutes of the movie,so if you 're looking for a film to watch in a theater with no real
1,because of this the movie is a total bore,because of the great acting talent the film has a
1,and the film 's plot is a little thin but the,and the ending of the movie has no meaning whatsoever
1,there are many other movies out there that are not worth seeing,there are some funny moments and the movie is a bit slow but
1,a lot of the film 's plot is told in flashback,a few scenes of the movie are not particularly memorable
1,instead of a movie like the other movies i have,instead of a good movie this movie is n't
1,the film 's main flaw is that it is so boring that it 's hard to,the film is very slow moving and it has a very slow pace to it
1,sometimes the movie is not a complete disaster,sometimes the film is not so bad as it
1,the film is not about as good as,the film is not a bad movie
1,while the film is a bit of a comedy it 's also a very enjoyable film,while i was n't expecting a lot of the movie i was expecting something more
1,but the movie is n't a total failure,but i do n't want to give it away
1,i was surprised to learn that this was,i was n't sure what to expect
1,finally i found this show very enjoyable,finally the plot was a bit of a
1,in a way this film is a masterpiece of the genre,in this movie the characters were very interesting and believable
1,to me it was a great film,to make matters worse i was not expecting
1,a lot of the humor is not funny,a few years later the two men are married
1,mayo 's film has a lot of potential,mayo 's performance as a character is very good
1,we are not told that the film is a masterpiece of a movie,we have the movie that is a little too much for the movie to
1,based on the true story of the famous author of the famous novel of the same name the story follows an important subject matter and it 's a very,based on the true life the legend of the killer is an interesting story of two sisters who have been separated from the same world for a year
1,there is no way that it 's ever a bad movie,there was a lot of potential to make a good movie
1,this is a film that is so,this is not a bad thing
1,you can see the director 's intent on making,you have a lot of things to do
1,so the movie is n't really that good,so what 's the deal with the film
1,this movie is not a movie for,this movie is a must watch
1,but i think it is the best movie i 've seen,but it is not as bad as the other films
1,if you have n't seen it yet you will find yourself in tears and tears,if you 're looking for a good film that will appeal to everyone you 'll enjoy
1,again it 's a very nice film to see if you,again i think it 's a great film to watch
1,in this movie the characters are very interesting and it 's a great film,in fact it 's just not as bad as it 's a good movie but
1,garry macdonald is a great actor and is always,garry lloyd is great in a small role
1,there is a scene where the hero is walking out of the house and,there are some good performances but it 's a bit of a mess
1,like i said i do n't think the movie would have been a lot more interesting if the characters were n't so much more developed,like the rest of the movie it 's not that good but the story itself is very good and it 's not a good thing
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's worth a watch,the film is about a group of people who go to a remote
1,we get a lot of fun and fun,we are left feeling like we 're watching a
1,the movie was n't bad enough but it was n't that good,the film is about two men and a man who is a compulsive
1,loaded with a lot of fun to be sure it 's a good movie to see,loaded with great actors and great performances by the actors the movie is an enjoyable little thriller
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the movie is a bit slow moving and the
1,i was surprised to see that the movie had a lot of potential to,i was surprised at how many of these people have seen this movie
1,that is a shame because this movie is so bad it 's good,that 's why i think that the film is not a total waste of
1,it 's the story of a young,it 's not that bad either
1,if you are looking for a film that is a bit of a thriller it should be,if you want to see a good movie about this one you 'll find this one
1,and that 's the only way to make,and the movie is a total disaster
1,that 's a shame because the movie has,that 's the problem with the movie
1,definitely the worst movie i have ever seen,definitely not a film for everyone but if you
1,it is the best movie i 've ever seen,it 's a shame because it was a waste of
1,the acting is pretty good and the plot is pretty good,the acting is good the story is very good the acting is
1,whether or not you can find it funny you 're not going to be disappointed,whether it 's the script the script or the acting it 's not bad
1,infantry and a lot of the other,infantry is a very good film
1,the movie is a complete failure to sit through,the film is a very good one and a very
1,and that was n't the case,and it is a good movie
1,instead we get a very bland and boring movie that is just too,instead we have an excellent cast that includes a very good performance
1,the film 's plot revolves around a group of young men who have a,the film is not a bad movie but it 's a good one
1,they are the only one in the film who is able,they are both a great combination of comedy and drama
1,there are some good performances by the two leads,there are some funny scenes in the movie but they
1,the film is a complete mess,the acting is horrible the story is
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the film was a complete waste of time
1,they are all very attractive and very believable,they are the ones who have the best lines
1,in the end the movie is n't even worth a look,in fact the movie is a little over the top
1,it is not the best movie of the year but the fact that it is,it is n't the worst movie ever but it is still a great movie
1,they have to be a little too much to ask for the next gig to do this,they are all very funny in a movie that is so good that they are not funny anymore
1,i think the movie is a good example to the genre of movies,i was expecting a lot more from this film but i was expecting something
1,the movie has some of the most interesting and touching characters ever captured on,the film is a little too slow and too predictable and too short
1,the film is not about the evils of the human psyche but it is a very very very very good film and a very good one,the film is about the struggle between two men who are not in the same situation but are also a little bit different in life
1,so what if they 're not all that bad,so if you are looking for a movie that will
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't available on the dvd or vhs,it was a very good film and it was a very pleasant surprise to watch
1,the acting is pretty awful but the script is,the movie has a great deal of suspense
1,i was surprised to see that this,i was n't expecting a lot
1,it is a very good movie,it 's a shame that the director
1,it 's not even a comedy,it is n't a bad movie
1,presenting the same old man who has a lot of things to say and the only reason he is n't,presenting a very interesting plot and a very good cast and a story that makes you laugh and laugh and laugh
1,i was n't expecting a lot more from,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,a few years later the movie is about the same people who are in the same place,a good cast including the leads and the actors who are all good in this film
1,it 's a very good film with a lot of laughs,it 's not the worst movie that i 've seen in a
1,though this is a film about a young woman who has to,though the story line is not a good one at all
1,also the film has a lot of,also a good cast is wasted
1,this is a very very bad film,this is a very funny movie that is
1,or maybe it was the acting,or maybe they were making a sequel
1,buscemi is a great actor and he has a great supporting cast,buscemi 's direction is a little slow and the story is n't as
1,the film is about the power of a relationship between two men who are married in a very small and very,the film is a little slow at times and the story is too thin for a movie to be told
1,or is it the best movie ever made,or maybe it 's the same way that you
1,another reason why i gave this film a 2 is because it 's,another problem with the movie is the lack of any real plot
1,chaplin is a very talented director,chaplin 's direction is a bit too
1,by the way this film is a complete disaster,by all means watch the original and enjoy the movie
1,his wife and daughter have to be a child,his acting was very good and the story line was
1,keep your eyes on your tv screen you,keep your attention out of this movie
1,if you 're going to watch this movie you should have a good time with it,if you 're a fan of the series and the original series you will find this show
1,the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous the dialogue,the story of the movie is a good one
1,she 's a very good actress who,she is not a great actress
1,hmm i know it 's not the worst of all,hmm the movie was a little too long for me
1,however the movie has no real redeeming quality,however the film has some good points
1,usually the movie does not work,usually i do n't think the actors
1,his wife and her son have been killed in the middle of a busy shootout,his character is so annoying that i ca n't believe he has ever been allowed to
1,it 's not that it 's bad,it was a great movie to watch
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and you have a modicum of time to,if you are a diehard fan of the series this is one of the few
1,recollections that were so bad they were good,recollections of a young man who has been killed
1,get the dvd and you 'll see what,get it out on dvd or dvd
1,thankfully the film has a few moments of humor,thankfully the movie 's only redeeming factor is the fact
1,but the film does n't have a good story,but i think it 's a great movie
1,making the film more interesting is the fact that the movie is set in the same location as the first film,making a movie about a man who 's been born for the first year is a good idea but not enough to
1,come in the form of a great cast and crew,come on guys who are n't the only ones who are
1,i have to say i did n't like the ending,i have never been so disgusted by this movie
1,granted it has a very good plot but the story is so bad that,granted it 's a little slow but it was a bit too long
1,there is a lot going on here,there was a scene where the girl 's
1,territorial hayden 's performance is not as good,territorial slater is a very good actor
1,finally the film 's title is the most important,finally the film is a bit too long
1,all of the other characters are very likable,all in all i 'd say this movie is
1,i was n't impressed by this film,i was so excited to see the film
1,this is a very funny film that is n't just a vehicle for a movie,this movie has a great deal of humor and it 's a shame that it has
1,however i have a feeling that the movie,however the story was n't that bad
1,yet the movie has a few faults in it,yet the movie is not so much as a comedy
1,however it 's a great movie to watch,however the movie is a bit too slow and
1,nevertheless this is a great movie for those who love movies,nevertheless it is a film that will make you cry
1,save your money and rent a copy of the first movie,save yourself the money and watch this movie for yourself
1,after seeing the first episode the second season is the most entertaining and enjoyable,after all the film 's story line is about the same thing as the first
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is about a bunch of
1,i was expecting this film to be a great movie and i was expecting something more,i have seen a lot of movies that have been made by people who like this kind
1,in this case the movie is a little too long,in fact the film was a bit too long
1,some of the scenes in the movie are very funny and are n't funny at all,some people have complained about it being a good idea but i think it is the best
1,misses the point and the film is not,misses the mark and the first film
1,for me it was the first time i saw it,for me the film has a lot to say and i
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i was surprised by the way it was
1,i do n't know what to say about this film,i have never read the book so i ca n't compare
1,if you want to see a good movie about an assassination mystery involving a serial killer then this is the film,if you 're looking for a good movie with a good story and good actors then you will love this
1,i was surprised that the director was n't so interested in the project,i do n't know why this movie has so much hype on it and
1,it 's a shame that this movie has not,it 's the same story as the first
1,what is the difference between the two,what a waste of time and money
1,the film is a little too long for its own sake,the acting is pretty good but the script is n't bad enough
1,i have to say that it 's a great movie to see and i recommend this movie to,i have n't seen the original version of the film but it is a very good movie
1,seeing this movie was a waste of time,seeing a lot of the film 's shortcomings in
1,they are both a great movie,they are all very attractive and attractive
1,die hard is a movie that is not worth,die hard is the worst movie ever made
1,this movie is a must see,this film is a very good example
1,i was surprised by the way it ended,i was expecting a lot of this movie but
1,loving the movie is a very funny film,loving to a young man who is a little
1,perhaps it was because the film was a little too long and the ending was a bit unsatisfying,perhaps the most memorable thing about this film is that it has a very interesting plot line
1,slaughter on the nile is an excellent film,slaughter is a movie that is n't afraid to
1,i was surprised to see that the director did n't have to make a film like this,i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the film but i was n't impressed by
1,the film has a very good story,the acting and directing is horrible
1,goodnight and his friends are the same,goodnight is a very good show
1,a few of the scenes in this movie are,a few of the actors were very funny
1,i do n't know how it got a pg rating but i still ca n't,i have to agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie is a masterpiece
1,as for the film itself it 's not a bad,as a result it is a very good movie
1,rosanna arquette as the young woman is quite good as she is in the first film,rosanna arquette is excellent as the mother of the young woman who 's a little too much
1,starting with the great acting by the actors it 's not bad,starting with the great opening sequence of the movie and a few scenes
1,lundgren 's performance is the only one that can save the film and it does n't even make it any better,lundgren is the best in the film and it 's a shame that this film has n't received a cult following
1,yes the movie is a little bit dated but there 's a bit of,yes i know it was a low budget film but it was n't
1,there 's a lot of action and a lot of action in the film but that is n't,there 's a lot of nudity in this film and it 's not even a good movie
1,the film is not about a group of friends who have to fight for their,the film has a very strong plot and is a real treat to watch
1,like a few years ago it was a little more fun to see the film in,like i said the film is a complete bore but it is n't that bad
1,movie is n't a good film,movie has a lot of problems but
1,you 'll see that this is a great movie,you 'll be glad to see a good film that
1,but the movie was a bit too long for,but the film is not a bad film
1,8 out of 10 stars for the,8 stars for a good story
1,there are some very good moments and the movie does have a nice touch to,there was no real plot to the film and the acting was n't bad
1,that said this movie is n't bad,that 's why i think this movie was
1,both the story and the characters are very interesting,both of these actors are the only ones that are
1,overall the movie is very good and i think,overall this movie is a waste of time
1,and the movie was shot on a cheap budget so it,and the film is not a total waste of time
1,full of clichs and some very good acting,full of holes in the plot and a very
1,to me this is a very entertaining movie,to be honest i do think the movie has
1,the film is a bit long and boring,the film was shot at the height of the
1,but i think it 's a good idea to show the whole thing,but it is a movie that you can watch over and over
1,whilst i was n't really looking at the movie it 's a bit too talky and not worth seeing,whilst i was n't a big fan of the original series i was very surprised that this was not a
1,it 's a shame that the movie is not available on dvd,it is a very good film and it 's not a bad film
1,this movie is a great example of how to make something good,this movie is so much of a comedy that it 's almost impossible
1,all the other reviewers are talking about this movie,all the characters were believable the story was intriguing and
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt,and it 's a shame because the whole
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd,it is the best of the series and i have seen the original
1,i have seen this film twice and i still do it,i was n't expecting much from this film but i was surprised
1,again this film does have its charms,again i do n't know what the hell
1,do n't get me wrong i love,do yourself a favour avoid this
1,the film is not a bad film,the film 's premise is a bit of
1,in the first movie there are two things to do with the story and the characters and the story is not,in this film it 's the fact that the movie is a bit too long and it has no story
1,peter falk is the only one to get a decent performance,peter falk is the only reason to watch this movie and it
1,if you 're looking for the best movie ever made then this movie is a must see,if you are looking for a good film with a strong story this is n't it
1,now i have to say the acting is great,now the story of the film revolves around a man
1,6 out of 10 stars out of 5,6 the plot is a bit thin
1,in fact it 's a shame that the director and director chose to get the rights,in fact it 's not even a movie it 's a complete waste of time
1,essentially this is a movie for everyone who wants to see a movie that will be enjoyed by all,essentially the movie is a bit slow but it does not have the same plot as it did
1,these two are the two main characters,these are the only things i can say
1,as the film progresses you can see the pain and suffering of the two leads as they are,as i mentioned the movie does n't seem to have the slightest appeal of a good story
1,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is n't bad either,it 's a pity that the director and the writer have never made a
1,if i had n't read the book i would n't have been surprised by the ending,if it were n't for a few scenes i would have been surprised to see the ending
1,both are the best actors in the film,both are a great example of how to make
1,way back when the movie was released i was expecting it to be a comedy but the acting was n't,way too often the film 's story is not very interesting and the story is not a complete mess
1,this film was a total waste of time,this movie is a waste of time and money
1,there is no real plot and it 's not even worth mentioning that it is n't even worth the time,there is a scene where a man who 's been stabbed by the devil is stabbed by a bat in a
1,one of the most underrated films of the year,one thing that makes this movie is that the director
1,after seeing this film i was impressed,after seeing this i thought it was going
1,see it if you can get the dvd,see it if you have n't read the book
1,in this movie we are treated to a bunch,in this one the acting is very poor
1,there are some good moments in the film but it 's a bit slow at times,there is also the usual suspects of the main characters that are not in the book
1,a few years later i saw a film that i would have been able to watch,a lot of the scenes in this movie were just plain stupid and i was n't impressed
1,as a result the movie is a complete failure,as a matter of fact the film was a bit
1,when you see the trailer of this movie it 's a very funny and very funny movie,when he 's on the screen he is a little more than a little stiff and his character
1,wow the movie was so bad it was almost laughable,wow the film is a bit slow but the acting is
1,every time i watch this show i was hooked,every time he appears he 's not going to get
1,there is a scene in which the main character,there are some funny moments in this film
1,there are some funny parts and the movie is just too much to be funny,there 's also a very good amount of gore and a few good scenes
1,the acting is horrible the plot is awful,the film 's story is about a group of
1,fortunately i do not want to give this a zero i do n't know if it 's the best thing i can say about it,fortunately the film is not as good as the first one but the acting and direction is pretty poor and the acting is horrible
1,without the aid of any of the characters or any character development i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good film,without the aid of a man who is a little too old to be a man in the world of the world he 's not
1,you 'll be glad you did,you can see this film as an
1,sure there are some great moments in the movie but it is n't,sure it has some of the most memorable scenes of a long time in
1,i have to say this movie is a complete waste of my time,i was n't really sure if this was a comedy or a drama
1,i was surprised by the ending,i do n't think this is a
1,i think the movie is just a little too long for me to enjoy,i think it is a great movie and one that i would recommend to anyone
1,john cusak was a great actor,john cusak is a very good actor
1,obviously the film is n't the worst film i,obviously the movie has a lot of potential
1,this is the worst movie ever i 've seen,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,does anyone else notice that it is not a comedy,does anyone know why they did n't have any real problems
1,for a movie like this to be a masterpiece,for the first two thirds of the movie i was
1,this is the best movie i have ever seen,this is a movie that is n't worth renting
1,the acting is very good and it 's not a bad thing to begin with,the film was a complete waste of time and i would have given it zero stars
1,had the movie been a little longer i would 've given it a higher score,had the director been given the opportunity of a film that would have made a good
1,when the film is over i think that the director and writer were trying to make a statement about the subject matter,when i watched the first one i was n't sure if i 'd seen this movie in the theater or not but i
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this is a movie that should never have
1,i have n't read the book but,i was surprised by this movie
1,i was surprised that this was not only a movie,i was so disappointed when i saw this movie
1,i was expecting a lot better but this one is so bad it 's funny,i was surprised to find that this film was not only a comedy but it is
1,her character has a very complex personality,her acting skills are so wooden she makes
1,falling asleep and a few of the other characters are the same,falling asleep and being a big part of the movie the plot was
1,but this film was so awful,but it is n't a bad movie
1,unless you 're a huge horror fan you should n't watch this movie,unless you 're looking for a movie that will entertain you to tears you
1,perhaps the most memorable part of this movie is the ending which is quite good,perhaps he 's a bit too preoccupied with the material but he does not have any
1,it 's just so bad that it 's almost painful to sit through,it 's not a good movie to watch but you 'll find it
1,these two are very good actors and the supporting cast,these are not the best examples of the movie
1,but it is n't that bad,but the film is a complete waste
1,it 's a shame that this movie,it 's a very good film
1,my advice for anyone interested is that i have seen it in a few months,my advice is if you want to watch a movie that is so bad you 'll
1,that was the first time i saw this movie,that 's what i thought was that good thing
1,it is a very good movie,it is the best movie ever made
1,i have seen this movie several times and it,i was expecting the worst movie ever made
1,lugosi 's character has a very good,lugosi is a very good actor
1,i was expecting a good movie but i did n't really care what the,i was expecting a movie to be a horror movie and i did
1,this is the best film ever made,this film is not for the faint hearted
1,everybody else was either a good thing or two,everybody is a bit more than the sum of their
1,i was expecting a good movie but i could have done it with my own brain,i do agree with many other reviewers that this movie was a waste of time and money
1,we have to be seen as an actor,we get a glimpse of the man 's life
1,as a result i was not impressed,as the movie progresses we are left with
1,that is the only reason why this is a movie that is not for people like me who want to see the movie and you,that 's a shame because the whole film is about a bunch of people who have no idea what to do with their lives
1,few of these films have the ability to have a story that makes a lot more sense,few of the characters are likable and the story is not as strong as the book
1,still the film has a good story and some great performances,still it 's a very enjoyable movie to be sure if it
1,the acting was horrible the script was awful,the movie starts off with a couple of people
1,while the film is a bit slow it has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty,while i was n't impressed with this one it was a very interesting story of a woman
1,it is a shame because it has a few funny parts,it is a shame that such a film has n't been released
1,the film has a very strong and interesting plot but it,the film is a complete waste of time and money
1,it was the first time i saw this film that i thought,it 's a shame because the film is not very good
1,trained in his own way he 's a man of a man who is a little more human than he is,trained by a few people who are a big fan of the genre and have seen the original series and have seen
1,she 's a good actress and is the only one who does n't even get to play,she is the best actress in the film but she 's just not the right actress
1,it is a movie about the life of an outsider who has a son and son who has to,it 's a shame to see a movie like this that is n't so much better than this
1,after all the hype is about the film,after the movie i was n't impressed
1,one day i saw a trailer of this show in the theater and,one of the best movies i have watched in a long time
1,this movie was a waste of my time,this is a film that will appeal to anyone
1,after a while i was n't able to watch this movie again and i was n't impressed by the,after the first 15 minutes i was n't really bored but i was n't sure what was happening
1,it is a very good show that is worth watching for,it 's not the same thing that the movie does
1,the film is a bit long but the,the film is not a complete failure
1,the film is a bit slow and drags out,the movie is about two young men who are in
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is one of those movies where
1,it was a good idea to make,it was a very nice movie
1,if it were n't for that i would have given it zero,if you are looking for a movie that is a good one to
1,since i was n't expecting a good horror film i did n't expect much,since i have been a fan of this series i was surprised to learn that
1,bea is a good actress who does n't have to be the,bea and his friend are the two roommates in the film
1,it 's a very good movie and,it 's not a bad movie
1,and the movie is n't as bad as the first two but,and i do n't think i have ever seen the movie
1,it 's a shame that the director,it was n't even that great
1,however the movie is a bit too much,however it is not a good movie
1,this movie was a complete waste of time,this movie is a must see for anyone interested
1,the movie is about two people who go to the same house to find a cure for the earth of a mysterious virus,the story of the movie is based on an actual event that is told by the author of the story of the president 's
1,his performance was very good and the film really stood out,his wife is a man and a young man who is married
1,the acting in this movie is so bad that it makes the actors,the film is a bit slow but the film is very entertaining
1,stick to the original and the original,stick with the original and the film 's
1,i'm sure that the director of the movie would have been more interested in the plot,i'm sure the film was a bit of an improvement on the viewers but the story itself
1,many of them are just plain boring,many of the other reviews have said that
1,this is the first film that i have ever seen that i 've watched,this film does n't make any sense at all and the film is a little
1,chances are you wo n't be disappointed,chances are there are a lot of movies
1,as for the rest of the movie it 's a pretty good,as for the story it is n't even that good either
1,i was n't expecting a movie of a film but the movie was so bad it 's funny,i do n't think it was that bad but it did n't have a lot of action and it
1,he 's not the best actor in the film but he is the,he is a very funny guy and he 's a good actor
1,good acting good directing and some very,good luck for the first time
1,i'm a fan of the genre and i am not a fan of the genre,i'm a fan of horror movies but i have to say that this movie is one
1,the film is a very good one,the acting was terrible and the script was
1,you can tell that the director was a director and it was n't,you can watch the whole thing and it 's not even funny
1,the movie has a lot of action and the plot twists are so predictable that you ca n't help but laugh at it,the film is about a young man named kenny who has a crush on his son who is now living in a large mansion
1,later in the movie the two main characters are killed and the other is the killer who kills them and kills them,later in the film the two of them go to the island and the two survivors decide to go to their destination and
1,add a lot of the original elements and you,add some of the worst movies ever made
1,unfortunately the story is so weak it 's,unfortunately the story is n't that good
1,however the plot is n't as bad and,however it is a very good movie
1,there are many scenes that are so bad that i could n't even tell whether the film,there are a number of other movies that have been released in the past few years
1,the film is a very interesting film,the acting was good the story was good
1,the film is a very funny one,the acting is good and the script is
1,well the movie was a complete mess,well i do n't know why i do
1,barney and the other boys are not even close to the truth,barney 's character is so stupid it 's almost impossible to root for
1,bette midler 's performance in the film,bette davis is excellent as always
1,for me the film 's greatest flaw is that the film 's central focus on the story of the characters,for those who do n't know that the film is a masterpiece of the genre it is a mustsee
1,guillermo del toro is a wonderful actor and the supporting cast was excellent,guillermo del toro is a fine actor but he is a bit of a
1,if you have a craving for a film that has a lot more than you want a good movie,if you want to see a good movie about a group of people in a small town in london and
1,simply the film 's greatest strength is the presence,simply put this is not an action movie
1,if i had n't read it correctly it would have been a little shorter,if you 're going to make an asian film about the evils of the vietnam
1,the film is a little too long for me,the story is a bit slow but the story and
1,the movie was a bit slow but the acting and the acting was so good,the film is about a man named melvin who has a very small life
1,then there 's the fact that the film is not about a group of men in the middle of a,then the film switches gears from the start and the story is about as exciting as a root canal
1,but the story is so predictable that,but the story was very good
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that this film has a great story line and a good plot but the,i was so disappointed that i was n't watching this film because i was n't a fan of the original
1,second of all there 's a lot of nudity and violence and the city has a little bit,second the story is a bit thin and the characters seem to be in a different situation
1,regardless of the fact that it is the only film i 've seen in,regardless of what i think of the film it is not a movie
1,goldeneye is the worst film i have ever seen,goldeneye is an excellent film that i would watch if
1,i was expecting something more like a remake of this movie,i was n't impressed with the story but i did n't think
1,it is a great story with excellent acting,it 's a great movie and i recommend it
1,not to mention a few of the scenes,not only was he not a bad actor he
1,this is a movie for those who like bad movies,this film was a waste of time and money
1,i do n't know what to say about,i have n't seen this movie yet
1,when the film is over the top and the characters are introduced as the characters are revealed to,when he 's a little girl he is a bit too old to get into his role
1,both films are a lot more enjoyable than this,both are the most interesting characters in the film
1,but the movie is a bit too,but i was n't expecting much
1,ok so i do n't know if the movie was supposed to be a spoof,ok so i was expecting a great movie to see a lot of good things about
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is the first film i 've ever seen,with the help of a friend who 's been a member of his family he has to
1,lite in the first place the film is a very interesting,lite and directed by john wayne and starring edward norton
1,i was n't sure whether i was watching a bad,i have n't laughed once during the entire film
1,much of this is due to the fact,much of it was the first half
1,the film is a very interesting and interesting film,the acting is very bad the script is bad the
1,but the movie was n't that great,but i do n't know what to say
1,did they really have a way of making this movie,did i mention that it was the same movie with some
1,so i do n't know if i can see it again,so i was n't expecting anything from it but this movie is
1,the acting is horrible the directing is worse the acting is awful and,the acting was terrible and i was surprised that it got released
1,unfortunately it 's not a movie that you,unfortunately this is not one 's film
1,i have n't laughed at a few of the other movies that have been so bad i think,i was n't expecting a movie that was so bad that i had to turn this off
1,the movie has a lot of action,the film 's main character is a woman
1,it 's a pity because the film is not a good idea,it 's a shame to see him in such a role
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money,the movie is a bit slow but i really do n't
1,then again what do i know,then i saw this film on the
1,the acting is good and the plot was pretty cool,the movie starts off with a bunch of kids who have
1,the story was so bad it 's unbelievable,the movie starts out with a group of friends
1,but the movie is a little bit slow and boring,but the film is not about a man who is a
1,hints at the end of the movie,hints are not that the film is a
1,if you are into a bad movie or you want to see a good film about the evils of war in,if you are looking for a movie that is not just an action movie it is a waste of time
1,the film is about a group of young adults and their parents,the film is a bit slow but the acting is excellent
1,minus any other movie i have ever seen the movie is very bad,minus the usual suspects of the genre this film is a must
1,the acting is very poor and the story is so bad that it 's hard to believe that a good film,the film is a very interesting film about a group of young people who are living in a small apartment
1,and i think that is the reason why i give this a 1 out,and it is not a good film but it 's not that bad
1,and the movie is so bad it is n't even funny at all,and that 's why i gave it a 2 because it is not the
1,this film is so bad i almost forgot that,this movie is a must see for all
1,in fact it is a very poor film and i do n't know if it is the best of it,in fact i would n't have to watch it again and i 'll be a fan of the original
1,all in all a great film that should be watched by all,all in all i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good
1,gus van dien was great in his part,gus van cleef 's character is the only one
1,four of the main characters are all a bunch of friends,four men who were in their own way were a group of
1,the movie has a great cast that is also the most memorable,the movie starts off ok but then turns into something that is n't
1,the movie has a lot of action and some really good action sequences,the movie starts with a very interesting story and the characters are very interesting
1,yeah this is one of the best movies ever,yeah i do not know what to say
1,well it was n't the worst movie,well the first one was great
1,and that was a good thing,and that was the most important element
1,this is a very very very bad movie,this film was made in a very small town
1,eventually the movie is set in a very small town where the film has a little of a plot to it,eventually the film starts out with a very long flashback sequence where the two men get together and the two men get
1,and it 's a great movie,and i have no idea what the
1,i was expecting a good movie to be a good movie but it was,i think that this movie is the most underrated film of the decade
1,also the film has some nice moments in it,also the film was a bit too long for a
1,i have never seen such an awful film in my life,i have to admit i was n't impressed by this movie
1,by the time the credits rolled i was a little,by the way the movie is a complete failure
1,taking the movie 's title and the title and the book is the,taking the film and the other it is a very funny movie
1,the film has an interesting plot and some good acting,the film is a very interesting portrayal of the man who
1,just do n't expect to be disappointed,just like the first one it 's just
1,these are two of those things that make this film so great,these are the kind of things you would want to see a movie
1,too often the film is n't that bad,too bad that the director has no idea who
1,the film is a bit slow and drags on to a point where it is not,the movie was made for the romanians and the director of this piece of garbage should not
1,what 's more the movie is a complete mess,what is the deal with the character of the movie
1,lloyd 's direction is a bit too slow and it 's,lloyd kaufman 's the first featurelength film was a masterpiece
1,adventures of the characters and their motivations and actions,adventures are not the same as we are in the
1,all the while i do n't know what i was talking about but,all in all this movie is a waste of time and money
1,they are all in the same room with the same girl,they 're not even close to being a good film
1,the acting and script are very good,the film is a bit of an exercise
1,it was a very interesting movie,it 's not a bad film but
1,i'm not a fan of the original but i was very excited to see this movie,i'm a fan of the genre and i have never been a big fan of the series
1,the film is a complete mess,the film is a complete mess with
1,after the first 15 minutes of this film i was hooked,after seeing this film you can understand why it 's so good
1,also the film is a very funny,also the ending is so stupid
1,seeing the first movie was a bit like a remake from a different perspective,seeing this film is like seeing the first one and i think it 's a
1,peck 's character is so unlikable that it is hard to,peck 's performance was a bit too much for me
1,although the movie is a good one it is a very interesting movie,although i think the director is trying to make a statement about the movie
1,if you 're looking for an interesting movie with some good laughs and a good story line you 'll be disappointed by this one,if you 're looking for a good film to watch with the director and you 're looking for something more than just plain bad movie
1,the acting was terrible and i was surprised at how bad the acting was,the film is about a young man named krishna who is trying to get a
1,the movie is not a bad movie,the film has a very strong plot line
1,in this movie the actors do n't know what they,in fact this movie is not a good one
1,as a movie it is a bit of a stretch for me but the movie was a bit too long,as i watched the movie i had to see it to get a few laughs out of the movie and laugh
1,then there 's the scene where he 's trying to kill,then the movie starts and the end is so predictable
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a little bit,it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen
1,the film was shot in a small budget but it was n't a big budget film,the movie is a bit long but the story line is so predictable that i could n't
1,put it on the shelf and see if you can get it on dvd,put this in your dvd player and you 'll see the same thing
1,the film is about a man named melvin who is sent to a remote prison to retrieve the earth,the movie is not for everyone but if you want to watch a film that is n't a bad one
1,wonder how many people are willing to accept this,wonder if the film is not a masterpiece
1,this was a very good movie,this is a movie for everyone who
1,first of all it 's a movie about,first the plot is a bit thin
1,everything is so bad it 's good,everything else was so good and it 's
1,it is a very simple film with an intriguing plot,it is a shame to see this movie in the theater
1,and i do not think that the,and that 's what i got
1,batman returns is a film that i can recommend seeing,batman returns is a great movie for everyone involved and i
1,of course he 's a little bit too,of course it 's not that bad
1,it 's a great show that is not only a classic film but,it 's not even that good and the acting is pretty bad
1,to be fair the movie does not have,to me it 's a great story
1,the acting is horrible the directing is bad the story is worse than the original,the acting is horrible the script is bad and the story just seems stupid
1,a lot of people have already said it 's not,a very good film and i highly recommend it
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is the story of a young
1,less than the sum of its parts it 's a film that will appeal to all ages,less of a drama than an actual movie about a young woman who has a boyfriend and a
1,their characters are very interesting and interesting,their characters are so bad that i could
1,but the story line is n't too bad,but this movie was a total waste of time
1,she is not a very good actor but she 's a very good,she is also in the movie and is not a good movie
1,quality is the best part of the film,quality is a little too long for me
1,so i do n't know what it was like to have a good story line and,so if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll enjoy this movie
1,what 's the point of this film,what i liked most about this movie was
1,that 's why i gave up on this movie,that 's the problem with it is that the movie
1,but the film is a little too slow and too slow for,but it 's a great story and a very good one
1,he is not only a master of the universe but,he 's a little more than a little nerdy
1,this is a very good film,this film is a must see for
1,that 's what the story line is,that is a very good thing to say
1,though the film does n't have the same budget as the original it 's a bit slow and dull,though i have seen the film several times and i have to say that it is not a bad movie
1,there 's a lot of nudity in the film,there was a lot of action in the film
1,if you are a fan of the genre this is definitely worth watching,if you are a fan of this type of movies i highly doubt you
1,at least that 's what i expected from the movie,at first it seems the filmmakers are trying to get the
1,almost every scene is the same as,almost every scene is a joke
1,a few years later the film has been a success,a lot of the film 's characters are not developed as
1,it 's a very simple movie and the actors are all good,it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd
1,and it 's a very funny movie and the movie is a,and it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
1,suzanne is a very talented actress,suzanne and her husband are in their
1,whilst the film does contain the best in the cast and the acting is the only saving grace of the movie,whilst the movie does n't have a lot of sex scenes and some of the most gruesome scenes involve a couple of
1,que chahta hai is an entertaining film,que chien andalou was a great film
1,depalma 's direction is very good,depalma is a genius as the storyteller
1,this film is not only a very bad movie it,this is a movie that i will not forget
1,apart from the fact that the movie is a little bit too long and the plot is not very interesting the story is very predictable and the acting,apart from a few faults i have n't seen the film in a long time but i have to agree that the film is a little dated
1,in fact i think that the movie would have been,in this film the characters were very well developed
1,either way i do n't think it 's,either way i would recommend this movie
1,the acting in all of these movies is pretty much,the movie is not a comedy but a comedy
1,but it was not that bad it was,but it was n't a bad movie
1,they are the best actors i 've seen in a,they 're not even funny enough to be funny
1,the film was a complete mess,the acting was terrible the plot was
1,while it is a very good story it 's a bit too long,while the story is not as good as the book i still think the
1,if you 're not a fan of the original you 'll find this film very entertaining,if the movie had been made to have some of the worst cgi i 've ever seen
1,seriously this is not a film to see if you,seriously this movie is a complete waste of time
1,we are left to believe the story,we get a lot of fun
1,these are the two adjectives that i have read on the imdb,these two are the same characters and they are so funny
1,i have seen the movie multiple times but this is the one that,i have seen this movie and it 's still a good one
1,he is a great actor and he has a very,he 's a little too old for his role
1,but it is a movie that will not be forgotten,but the movie was so bad that it could n't have
1,yet i have n't seen it since i first,yet it was a great movie to watch
1,second it 's a shame the rest of the movie is n't so good,second it 's a movie with a lot of action and a good ending
1,whatever the reason i was n't disappointed,whatever the reason the film was shot in
1,basically this is a very funny film that has a great cast,basically it 's not a great movie but it 's a good example
1,then again the movie is not about a woman who is in her own way,then there was a scene where the two girls were in the same room
1,if you are into a movie that is n't so bad you 're probably,if you 're a fan of the series you should see this movie
1,it 's the kind of film that is so bad,it was a good movie but not the best
1,this movie was a complete waste of time,this is a movie that is not only for
1,why did n't they just kill the girl,why did n't she try to make her a
1,i have never seen the movie but the movie has a great cast and,i have to admit that the film is a complete waste of time
1,his character is a stereotype and the story is a complete mess,his character is the only one who has to face the role of
1,so the movie starts out with a bang,so if you 're looking for a movie that
1,i have to say the movie was a waste of my time,i was n't expecting much of the movie to be a horror movie
1,another reason why the film is so good is that it is so bad that,another example was the scene where the two men meet in a crowded cabin
1,good luck for all the good guys,good luck is the best of the series
1,the movie is not as good as the original,the film is about the power of war
1,here 's another movie that is n't even a good one,here is a film where you can see the influence of the
1,does n't it be the same,does n't that have to be the
1,there 's a lot of good acting and some really,there are some very good scenes in the film
1,i was so disappointed that i had to watch a lot of movies,i have seen this show and i have to say it is very good
1,they are not the same as they are in the,they are both very funny and are very funny
1,cute and funny and a lot of fun,cute little kids and girls who have a good
1,i was expecting a lot of this,i have seen it twice now
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed,i think it is a very good film
1,there is nothing inherently bad about this movie,there is a lot of action and a few
1,people have to have the same problem with me,people who have read the novel should be advised to
1,with this movie it was very good but it was just a waste of time,with the exception of the film 's plot and character interaction between the two leads the
1,ok it 's a little bit too much for,ok so the film is a little slow
1,you know that the film is a spoof of the original,you know that the film was a little too long
1,for a movie like this i think it 's a great movie to watch,for a while it is a film that will not disappoint and will appeal to
1,the story line is so bad that it 's almost laughable,the film is a little slow and slow paced but the film
1,this movie was made in the early seventies,this is one of those movies where the story
1,of the many people who say this is a,of course there 's a lot of action
1,the film is very well done and has a,the film is a bit of a mess
1,but this is the first time i saw the,but the film is a little too slow
1,this film is a very funny film,this film is a must see
1,this was a very bad movie,this movie was a complete waste of
1,along with the other actors in this one i was n't surprised that this was a movie that was so bad,along with a few good scenes and a few of the characters are the most memorable i 've ever seen
1,i have seen the original version of it and i think it 's a bit,i was n't expecting much from it but i did n't like the movie
1,in fact it was the most disappointing movie i 've ever seen,in the meantime it 's a good film and it is very well
1,the film is a very good film and it is,the acting is horrible and the script is awful
1,i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it was released on video in the uk,i was expecting a movie that was a little more interesting and i could have done without the ending
1,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,this movie is so bad that it is
1,sarah silverman 's acting was pretty good and the story was good and the,sarah is a very beautiful actress who is not a very good actress
1,kevin costner is a great actor but the film is so bad that it makes,kevin bacon is a great actor but i do n't know how to act
1,this is a movie for those who like a good horror flick,this is the first time i have ever seen the film i saw
1,there is nothing wrong with the movie but it,there is a lot of action and suspense
1,tanks are n't always in the vicinity and the story,tanks are the most important thing in the world
1,the acting in this one was superb and the acting is excellent,the film was very well acted and directed and i would recommend it
1,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the lead actress,the movie is about a man who 's been kidnapped by a man
1,it 's the story of two sisters who are sent to prison for a reunion of their own but the two of them have to deal,it 's a shame that the director never had a chance to show this film to the audience as it was a very poor film
1,the film is a little slow at the end but it is a very satisfying film,the acting is very good but i think the script was a little too thin for the
1,please do n't waste your time on this one,please do n't waste your time on this one
1,later the movie is about as good as it can get,later the film becomes a little more complicated and it is n't
1,i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen,i have never heard of the movie but this film is a
1,how can you make a movie that is,how can you have to watch it
1,he is also a great actor,he is the best actor ever
1,now the story is about a bunch of people who have been in love,now i am not the only person who has n't seen the film
1,mina is a very good character and the supporting actors are great,mina is the best actress ever and she 's not only a good
1,to me the best part of it is the ending,to say it all is one of the best movies i
1,sorrows and the film is about a man who is a woman who is not only a little bit more but he is,sorrows and lies are all the more intriguing and the film 's story line is quite intriguing and the performances are excellent
1,would you want to see a movie that 's not,would have been a lot more fun to watch
1,story is about a man who is a man who has a wife who is married to,story of the famous american family is a very interesting and very very very interesting movie
1,the acting was good and the story was good,the movie is a bit of a disappointment
1,judge is a good movie but not as good as the original,judge reinhold is one of the most beautiful and most underrated actors of
1,one of the worst movies ever made,one of the most beautiful films i 've
1,and that was n't the only reason i watched this film,and the film is a little bit too slow and boring
1,the film is a bit slow but,the film is a complete mess
1,this was the worst movie i have ever seen,this was the best movie i have seen
1,i was so disappointed that i could not find anything to like in the,i was n't expecting much from this movie but it was very entertaining
1,vacuous but not a bad movie,vacuous but the story is n't too
1,the story is a simple one with,the film was a complete failure
1,just as you would have thought it was going to be a bad movie,just a few minutes later it 's a very long drawnout and boring scene where
1,and the movie has a lot of good things going on it is,and the ending of the movie is just a little too much
1,kal ho naa ho is a very good film,kal is a good actor but he is n't a
1,however i have to say i was n't,however the film is a complete mess
1,i'm not sure what it 's supposed to be but i do n't know what it was,i'm not a big fan of the genre or even the slightest bit of a plot summary to
1,then there is the fact that the story is about a group of people who live in a small mansion,then there 's the fact that the movie is not only about a group of people who get married and are
1,having said that the movie is a bit of a mess,having seen the first film the first time i saw the trailer
1,inter spoilers for the film it was made in a time of the week,inter the movie is not as great as the original but it is still very
1,one of the best things about a movie is that,one of the most underrated films of all time
1,midnight cowboy is a film that will be remembered by all ages,midnight cowboy is one of my favorite movies of all time
1,there was a lot of action in the movie that i did n't know,there are many many scenes where the characters are supposed to be the ones who
1,sure it 's a bit of a stretch to be taken seriously but it does n't have to be that much,sure the story is a little convoluted but it 's a good movie and it 's not just that the story is
1,likewise the film is not as funny as it was made for a,likewise the acting was pretty bad and the plot was pretty lame
1,not a bad movie but a great one,not to mention that this movie is n't a
1,after all these years i have n't read the book but i have read that this is,after the first hour of the film i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry
1,i have never seen a film that i have ever walked,i have to say that this is a good film
1,alright i know i was in the mood for the movie to be made in the early 70 's but it was so,alright i 've read the comments on the film and i do n't know why i was n't impressed at the time
1,this is one of the best movies,this is a very good film
1,there is no real reason for the existence of a character to develop the motivations of,there are some good moments but the story is so weak that it becomes unbelievable
1,do n't get me wrong there were some very good moments in the film but it is n't a bad film it is a very good,do n't get me wrong i love this movie but it is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who loves good movies
1,you have to be one of the most talented actors to ever be able to make,you have to wonder how many of the people involved in this movie are trying
1,if you have n't seen this movie you 're missing a lot,if you 're going through this film with an open mind you will
1,more like a movie of a movie with a,more than a little of a good thing
1,unlike many other reviewers i have read the book the first time and i,unlike most of us i have seen a lot of the other movies
1,i have to admit that i am not a fan of this type of,i think the director was trying to make the movie a little better
1,randy quaid plays the lead character who is a bit of a caricature,randy 's character was so annoying that i felt sorry for him in this
1,and the acting was so bad,and the film 's ending was very
1,the movie is a little slow paced and the story is a little slow but,the movie is very good but the plot was weak the acting is bad
1,sooraj and his friends have a lot of fun with each other and the characters are likable enough,sooraj is a man who 's always trying to find a way to make the right people and to
1,first of all it 's a pretty good movie but it is not as good as it is in a movie,first i was a bit confused at the time when i was in a mental institution and was so disgusted by the
1,whatever the reason i did not give this movie a,whatever the case the movie is a complete mess
1,some of the scenes are so bad they,some of the actors are very good
1,another thing that bothered me was the way the movie was shot,another problem is that the story is not a complete disaster
1,the film is about the same thing as the other movies,the movie has a lot of potential to go along with it
1,the story is about a young woman whose life,the film 's premise was a bit thin
1,sorry i do n't want to spoil the film for you,sorry i did n't see this film in the theatre but the
1,few of the other characters are very likable or believable,few of the characters are very interesting but the film 's
1,i'm not sure what it is,i'm not sure what the point of
1,why do they keep making movies like this anymore,why does n't she do the right thing
1,why did they make a sequel to this,why did n't the director bother the question
1,paul rudd was great in this movie,paul rudd is excellent as a man who
1,the story is a little weak but it 's not a,the acting is horrible but the script is a joke
1,of course he has a good sense of humor but that 's not a,of course it 's a little too long but the movie is not
1,all in all it 's a pretty bad movie,all of the actors in this movie have a lot
1,in the end it is a great film to watch,in this case i was a little sceptical and i was

1,one of the most memorable scenes is when the girl is talking to her son in a car accident,one of my favorite films is when i saw the movie in the theater and i thought that it was
1,in fact it 's not even a movie,in fact the only reason i can think of
1,she 's a very good actress who,she 's a very good actor
1,particularly the scenes where they are shot in the dark and the camera work is so bad that,particularly when the film is over and over again i think the film is a bit long
1,i was n't expecting the movie to be a success but i found myself laughing at the stupidity and,i do n't think i 've ever seen any other movie that has made me think about this
1,the film is a complete mess,the film has an interesting premise but
1,not to mention the fact that this,not a bad movie for you
1,i have n't laughed so hard at a tv show since,i have to admit that i was very impressed with the movie
1,here 's a movie i would n't want to see,here 's a movie that is n't so much better than
1,besides this film is a very good movie,besides the plot and character development the film is
1,like i said i do n't know why this is,like the first one the acting is pretty good
1,kusama has a knack for making a film that is a little bit too slow and lacks any of the usual flair,kusama is the master who has been in the works that he has created and the film has a very unique look
1,his character is so unlikable that you can barely see how much of his character is the villain,his character is so annoying and so annoying that it 's hard to believe he could have been more
1,he was n't a good actor but,he is not a bad actor
1,how did the director know that he could do a,how can i not be able to watch this
1,the film is a very good one,the film has a lot of good moments
1,let me tell you it 's not a good film,let me just say that the film has a lot of
1,mystery of course is the story of two young people living in new,mystery science theater 3000 is a movie that you will never forget
1,in the end it 's all just a bunch of bad,in the end it 's a great movie to watch
1,having seen the movie i have to say i had the opportunity to see the,having read the book the book is a very faithful adaptation of the novel
1,following a series of murders that are supposed to be a bit more interesting to the story of the film the viewer is given,following the movie i was expecting a good story to be told and i did n't think it could be a good film
1,unfortunately it 's not that great,unfortunately i do n't want to ruin
1,as a result the plot is a bit thin and the,as for me i have seen a lot of movies
1,a lot of people have complained about this movie,a lot of the movie 's plot is told in
1,also the film is a complete bore,also the ending is very abrupt
1,appropriately the movie has a lot of action and,appropriately the film is not a complete failure
1,he is also in a wheelchair with a woman in a suit and a man,he 's a great actor but he does n't have much to work with
1,as a result of the film it 's a very good film,as a result of his life his wife has a nagging relationship with
1,there is nothing in the film that makes you feel like you 're watching the film,there 's a lot of nudity in this film which is why i gave it a 2
1,i was n't sure whether this was an action film or a thriller but it was very entertaining,i was n't really expecting anything more than a movie about a man who is a loner and he
1,310 rated r for graphic violence and gore,310 i love the fact that the movie is
1,still the film has a good message,still the film is not as good as
1,if you 're looking for a fun film that is n't really a horror movie you,if you 're a fan of the series you 'll find the film pretty funny
1,you 'll be glad that you 're going to be able to get to the end of this movie but i,you can see that there is a lot of people who have to be in the movie for no reason
1,i have to say this film is not a bad thing,i was expecting a good story and i was disappointed
1,instead it is a very poor film with an awful script,instead of the typical hollywood fluff it is a great movie that
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt,and the film is a bit slow at
1,like the previous reviewer i have n't seen the original,like the rest of the movie it is a very interesting
1,i have never heard of it so much,i was surprised that this was a sequel to
1,things start to go downhill when he discovers the truth and is n't really that much,things start to go downhill when the mother is kidnapped and the mother is killed
1,for the first half of the film the audience sees a lot of people walking through the,for a movie that is a bit of a spoof it is a very good film
1,and the ending was so bad,and i was surprised at how many
1,i do n't know how this movie got such a,i was surprised that i did n't see it
1,for me it 's a movie that is n't just a bad movie,for the most part i think that the movie was made in the early
1,the film has a great deal of humor and a few moments that will surprise you for years,the movie is about a bunch of people trying to get married and the only person who has a
1,the acting and the story is very poor and the,the film is a little bit of a bore
1,she 's a very nice actress,she is a great actress and a
1,i was n't sure what was going to happen to,i was expecting a lot better than i expected
1,come on the other side is that the film is a complete mess of a film,come on people who have a problem with this movie are not the ones who do n't
1,let 's get back to my opinion,let 's face it the acting is n't
1,an excellent film and a very good movie for those,an excellent film and one of the better ones
1,also i think that the movie is just too long,also the film has the same kind of feel as if
1,a few of the characters are good and it is a shame that they were n't given a lot of credit to them,a few years later the film 's success is to be a little too late for its own good and it is not a
1,a lot of people have commented on the lack of originality,a very good movie with great performances from the cast
1,unlike the first movie it was very good,unlike most of the other movies of the period
1,apparently the director of this movie was n't a fan of the book,apparently there is a difference between a movie and a good one
1,and i think that the film is a,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,director david lynch is the director of the original novel,director john mctiernan has done a good job in this film
1,it 's the only way i can,it was a very good movie
1,i was n't expecting a lot,i was n't sure if this was
1,the movie is a very interesting one,the film is a complete failure
1,have you ever read a book that is so awful and so lame,have n't seen this movie in the theater and have no idea how to
1,oh my god the movie 's main problem with this movie was the lack of,oh and i have to say that i was n't impressed with the movie
1,only the most ardent fan of the original would be able to find the original,only a small group of survivors who have to fight for the first time
1,inspector paul is a great movie,inspector and his wife are a couple
1,now i know i was n't,now i do have the feeling of
1,the film 's main drawback is the lack of any real talent and the lack of any,the film is a little bit of a mess and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,together with the rest of the cast it 's,together they are all in a different situation
1,it is a movie that is not,it is n't even a movie
1,however the film is very good,however i think the director and director
1,still it does have a few good moments,still the movie is a good one
1,i do n't want to spoil anything,i was surprised to see the movie on
1,but the film does not have the same problems that,but the movie is a little bit too long
1,in the end it is a very interesting and entertaining movie,in a way the film is n't even a good film
1,i have to agree with the reviewer who said that this,i have to say this is the best movie ever
1,the film is not a documentary of the life of a young,the movie is about a man trying to save his life
1,and i was impressed by the fact that the film was made by,and the acting was good but i thought it was pretty awful
1,unlike most movies i 've seen this movie is not a bad one,unlike the first film i have to say that i was n't impressed by
1,do n't worry to be taken as,do n't worry about this movie
1,this movie was made for the sole purpose of being a film,this is a movie that is not only for the sake of a
1,after all the hype is not only the most controversial film,after the film 's release it 's still pretty good
1,so if you are a fan of the series then you 'll find this movie,so i do n't think that 's the best way to describe this movie
1,this is one of those films that is n't funny and it 's not funny,this movie has no plot no character development no real acting no real plot no story
1,i was so impressed by the film that i was surprised by the fact that the story was a bit too,i do n't think this movie was made for the sake of a good film but the acting is great
1,martin scorsese has a great deal of,martin is a very good actor
1,the film is not as funny as the first one but it 's a,the film has a very nice feel and a nice pace to it
1,the story is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad thing,the acting is very good but it is the only thing that is good about it
1,in a sense of the word it 's not even the worst movie ever,in this film the main characters are the ones who are not in the film
1,until then the film is about a young woman who has a crush on a woman who is a bit of a sadomasochistic,until the end of the movie the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that the movie was so bad
1,do you want to know what the real world,do not waste your time on this film
1,the movie starts with an old man being shot in the head with a chair,the film 's premise is a little thin and the characters do n't seem to have
1,i was surprised to see this movie,i have seen it three times now
1,the film is a little slow but,the movie was made for tv
1,this film is a must see for all lovers of film noir fans and a,this film is a must see for anyone interested in the history of war
1,i was surprised that this film had been released theatrically,i was so excited that i had wasted my time with
1,why did n't he just kill the girl,why does the director have the audacity to make
1,it 's a very good story and a great movie for,it 's a shame that it was n't released theatrically
1,basically this is the kind of film you should have done n't expect to,basically a lot of the movie is about the characters and their relationships
1,i have to admit i was n't a fan of this movie and i do agree with the other reviewer who has said,i have to agree with the comments on how the film is a bit over rated as the first of the many
1,there is a lot of action and some of the action scenes are very good but not enough to save the film,there is also a scene in the movie where a woman is lying at a table with her boyfriend and says she has
1,let 's start off with the acting and,let 's get back to the movie
1,this is the first time i ever,this was a very bad movie
1,but this is not a good film,but i do n't think the director could
1,columbo is the most beautiful and intelligent woman in the world and,columbo is a very good character actor and a good actor
1,put together a film that is not only a good film but a good film,put it in the context that it was a good movie but not that bad
1,ridiculous and predictable this is a film that should,ridiculous plot and a lot of bad acting
1,all in all i would recommend it,all in all this is a very bad
1,he is a man who is a man who can be,he is a very nice guy and a good guy
1,would you want to watch the movie,would n't it be if he were to
1,i think that this movie was a complete waste of time and money,i do n't think this film is a masterpiece of its own but its
1,the movie is not a complete waste of time and time,the acting is good and i have seen some of her movies
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have to admit that i was very impressed,i was so impressed by this movie that it 's a shame that it has never been released
1,she 's the one who is n't in,she is also a very talented actress
1,the movie has a lot of action scenes,the movie is not as bad as it is
1,while the story is n't too bad the acting is good and the story line is very entertaining,while the story was a bit slow the movie was very well made and the acting was excellent
1,even though it 's not a good film it 's still very good and it 's a good film,even though i 've never seen a movie that is as bad as this one i have to admit that
1,what a wonderful film this movie is,what is the difference between the actors in
1,which brings us to the film,which is what the film is about
1,while the film is a bit slow the story is a little confusing,while i have n't seen the first movie i have seen the original
1,one of the most interesting films of the last twenty years,one day a woman named melissa is a young woman who is
1,as for me i have n't seen the original,as for the rest of the cast i think they
1,why do they keep making such crap,why do i have to write a comment
1,oh and the ending where a little boy,oh and the music in the background
1,especially if you 're not a fan of the original,especially if the movie is not a good movie it 's
1,the film was shot in color in the late,the movie has a lot of good moments
1,lately the movie is not as good as the first film and it 's a bit of a shame,lately the film is not as good as the first one but i have n't seen the original
1,deceptions and a few other things happen to them in a very different way and they have to do with the plot,deceptions are not the only ones who have to be in the film and are not the ones that are supposed to be
1,i have to say that the movie has a great deal of action and i think the film was a bit too dark for,i do n't know if i was a fan of either the book or the book but i was expecting a good film
1,it 's a shame that such a film,it 's a pity that the movie has a
1,no one can deny it and i have n't read the book so far,no wonder it 's a movie that is a little too long for the most
1,were they supposed to be the real people,were we supposed to be amused by the fact
1,if it was n't for the good actors and the bad acting i 'd be given a few bucks,if it had a chance to be the first movie i 'd have seen it in a heartbeat
1,after a few minutes of this film we get to see the first half of a film,after the first 15 minutes of the movie the audience was left thinking of a movie
1,here 's the plot of the movie,here is a very funny movie with a
1,will smith and douglas fairbanks jr as the main,will you be a fan of the movie
1,last year he has the chance to be the first person,last and not least the title is a bit misleading
1,after the first 15 minutes of it i was hooked,after a while it 's all downhill from there
1,this is a very good movie,this movie is not for everyone
1,the acting is good the script is great and the actors are excellent,the acting is pretty good and the script is very sharp and the acting
1,i do agree to say that the movie is a,i was surprised that the film was so bad
1,not only is the plot so bad it 's,not a bad movie for the whole family
1,the acting is good the story is great and the actors are excellent but it 's a,the movie starts out as a series of vignettes and turns into a series of flashbacks
1,but the movie is not a good film,but i was not impressed at all
1,looks like a bad idea to have,looks like a cheap tv show
1,i do n't think it is the fault that it,i was n't really expecting anything from this movie
1,a very good film that is worth seeing,a few years ago i had to see the
1,keep it from being a good film,keep it in mind if you want to
1,i was n't expecting anything much more than this movie,i was so disappointed that i did n't see the movie
1,i have n't read the books so i ca n't really compare it to,i do not think that this is one of the worst movies ever
1,like a movie about a woman and a woman,like i said before this is a great example of
1,it is a shame the rest of,it is a very good film
1,characterisations and music are all excellent,characterisations like this are the only thing
1,one of the most memorable moments is the one,one of his best and most memorable movies
1,it was n't a great movie,it 's just a little too much
1,in the first movie he 's just a,in fact it 's just not funny
1,and the ending is very abrupt,and the movie was so bad that
1,alec guiness plays an excellent character actor in the film,alec guiness was a great choice for his character
1,if you 're looking for an interesting story about a young man who is a bit of,if you have not read the books or seen the original film you 'll know why
1,i was n't expecting anything from this movie,i was n't really sure whether this movie was
1,it was the most expensive of the four,it 's not that i do n't want to
1,salim 's performance is the best thing about this film,salim is a very funny and very funny show
1,do n't be fooled by the comments here on,do n't waste your money on this movie
1,the film is a little slow at times but overall it works,the film 's story is a bit too long and the ending is
1,after the movie i was very impressed with the story and the performances,after seeing the trailer i knew i 'd seen it in my lifetime
1,stand out for a good movie,stand as a classic example of how
1,everyone in this movie seems to be,everyone is entitled to the end
1,apparently the film was filmed at the same time as the first time i saw the movie and i thought it was going to be good,apparently the film is not as good as the first but still it 's a very good film and it is a great family movie
1,but the story is a bit slow and the story is n't that good,but the movie is not about the war or the war it 's about the
1,tourette 's is the most entertaining film of the,tourette 's is a good movie for everyone
1,a very funny scene in a movie where a woman is killed by a,a few years later i was able to find a copy of it
1,we are left to ponder what is going on and what it is about,we are shown to be the first to see a film that was so great
1,this film is a very good film,this is the best movie i have seen
1,so the film is about a man who is a woman and he 's trying to save his,so i have to say it 's a great film to see if you can find it
1,if you want to watch a movie that has some of the same characters,if the movie is not a good thing it is not for you
1,that is what makes this film so good,that said the film is a complete failure
1,it 's not that it 's not bad and i think,it 's not the best but it is still good
1,for the first time the only thing that kept me watching this film was the fact that the movie,for me this film was not only a very good film but it also has a great cast
1,the acting in this movie is horrible and the script is just plain bad,the film was shot in a small town in the early seventies and it was
1,screen legend is a movie that has been released in dvd with a few friends and a couple of friends,screen adaptations of the classic novel are the ones that were originally intended to be a remake of the original
1,he 's not a bad guy,he 's a little stiff and he
1,the film has a very good story and a good premise to boot,the film is a little slow but the story is a little too thin
1,when he is a teenager he 's just a kid,when you watch a film like this you have a good
1,my advice is that if you have a chance to see the movie you should definitely enjoy it,my favorite part of the movie is when the girl is trying to get the girl to sleep with
1,i was surprised that i wasted 2 hours of my life watching a film that i would never watch over and over again,i do n't know why this film is so good and so many of the reviewers here seem to be in it
1,lemmon and dunne have a great chemistry together,lemmon 's character has to be the best character
1,he has the most disgusting scene and the rest of the cast is,he was also very good in the role of a young man
1,you know that the story is a little bit too convoluted but it really is not that bad it 's not even a great movie,you know the drill of the main character is the one that makes it so hard to understand why he has to choose between her
1,it 's a very good story and a great cast but the,it 's a very good movie with a very good cast
1,it 's a very funny film with,it 's just a bad movie
1,i do n't think that the movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever,i was so disappointed that i had to watch this movie to find
1,end spoiler the film is a little slow,end spoiler i think that it is a great
1,in the end it is a very good film with a great cast and,in a nutshell this is a film that is n't a total failure
1,is the story about the power of love or the,is it a comedy or is it a comedy
1,this was one of the best of,this is a very good film
1,it was a great show and it was a great movie,it 's a very bad movie and the acting is horrible
1,adam sandler is a great actor and he is a,adam sandler is the most talented of the bunch
1,the acting is good but it is n't the worst film i 've ever seen,the acting is horrible the plot is awful the acting is awful the effects are awful
1,there is a reason for that,there 's a lot of nudity in
1,i was surprised by how many of the characters in this movie were so stupid,i do n't think that this movie would be made for the family but it was
1,i have never been to australia before,i do n't think it would be a
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a serial killer who kills a girl and he is a,i do n't know what it means but i have to say that the acting was good
1,even the actors are n't as bad as,even the acting is n't that bad
1,there are some good moments in the movie but,there are many other things wrong with it
1,there are some good moments in this film but it does,there is no plot to be found in the film
1,the film is not about the war and the effects of the film,the movie is a little over the top but it is a great movie
1,furthermore the film is a very poor attempt at making a,furthermore this movie was made to make a good movie
1,this film is one of the most,this is a very good film
1,i do n't think i 've ever been a big fan of the series,i do n't think it 's the best of the two films but it 's
1,in this movie it 's a very good movie with a,in the end the movie is a very good one
1,worst of all it is a film that is n't funny and,worst movie i 've seen in a long long long time
1,the film has a lot of action and the plot is pretty basic,the film 's premise was that a group of teens who were in a
1,the acting is horrible the story is bad and the characters are stupid the story is ridiculous and the ending is so bad that it 's,the film is not about a man 's life and his life and his life and how he is able to deal with the problems
1,i have never been to a film theater where the director of this movie was in the mood,i was n't impressed with this movie because i was bored by the end of the movie
1,from a technical standpoint this film was very well acted,from the beginning i knew i was going to be disappointed
1,in fact i was n't sure what was going to happen next,in fact it 's a shame to see such an amazing movie
1,anyone who thinks that the movie should be enjoyed by a younger audience,anyone who is n't a fan of the genre will be disappointed
1,then i was looking to get a copy of,then i was n't sure what to expect
1,so the movie is n't a good one,so if you are into this sort of thing
1,it is a movie that will be forgotten and not only will appeal to everyone who has seen the original,it is n't that i do n't know what it is about the story but i do think that the film
1,then i was able to sit back and watch the movie,then the movie starts out and the characters are n't even likable
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but i found it,i was surprised that it was n't a sequel to the original
1,if you have n't seen this movie do not,if you 're a fan of the original then i
1,noir is a good thing but the film,noir was a good thing for me
1,there was a lot of nudity in it,there are some good performances and i think that
1,they 're not funny at all but it is,they are not funny but they are not
1,but the film does n't seem to,but it was not that bad
1,a very interesting story about a man who has lost his,a few scenes are shot in a very dark light
1,now that i have seen a lot of movies i 've seen that i have seen so,now the plot is a little weak and the characters do n't really make any sense
1,adapted to the novel by the director and the cast of the movie i have to say that i 've,adapted from a play by the author of the book i read the novel and read about this movie
1,at one point i thought it was a good idea to put a movie on,at least the movie was a bit of a joke but it did n't
1,especially when he is a little too young for his own,especially when the first one was about to be made
1,troma is n't the worst movie of,troma 's films are the same
1,mansfield is not the best of the bunch but it 's a fun,mansfield park is a film that i would love to see again
1,the movie starts out with the main character telling her about the story of a young woman named lila,the film has a lot of problems but the film is a little too slow for the most part
1,if you have n't seen this movie you 're not sure what to expect,if you have a craving for the movie you can get the feeling that it
1,he is the most annoying person in history,he was a good actor but he was n't
1,unfortunately the movie is not a bad movie,unfortunately this is not a film for everyone
1,the acting is horrible and the script was n't even funny,the film is a little slow but the acting is good and
1,do n't get me wrong i love,do n't worry about the movie
1,and the film is a complete mess,and that 's the only thing that is
1,oh and the last scene in the movie where the camera pans off in the middle of a crowded car chase and then,oh and a couple of people who have been in love with a girl who is not in a relationship with her
1,i have to say that this movie is not for everyone,i have never seen a movie like this in a long time
1,you 'll have a good time watching this film it 's a good thing,you know the kind of movie you have to see and that makes you want
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who go into a house and spend a night together in a small town,the film was shot on location in the early seventies and was filmed in the seventies with the lighting of the film
1,maybe it was a mistake to see the movie,maybe he should have had the chance to get the
1,i was expecting something more from a movie but i did not have to pay attention and the,i was expecting a lot of the same old movie but it was a lot of fun
1,i have seen this movie and i have to say,i was n't expecting anything more from the film
1,i do n't want to spoil it by the end of the film but it 's a very entertaining movie,i was surprised to find that this film was made in the early 1980s and the early 1960s in which we
1,with this movie i have to wonder why i was so disappointed,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 the movie is n't a complete
1,usually the movie has some good points but it 's not that good,usually the movie 's plot is a little too predictable for a movie but
1,after all it 's a film of the highest caliber and it 's not that it is n't,after all this is a film that is not only the most expensive film but also a very good
1,so what 's it with the whole movie,so what i did see was that it was
1,when i first saw this movie i was a little confused and confused,when i first read a comment of a movie i was looking for it
1,the film is a bit slow and boring,the film is about a group of young kids
1,it 's just so bad that you ca n't help thinking the movie is just,it 's a shame because the movie is not so bad it 's good
1,their performances in the movie are very good,their relationship is a bit strained at times
1,with a cast like this that i would have given up on the,with the exception of this film it was n't a great movie
1,i think this movie was made for the sole purpose of the movie,i do n't think i 've ever seen such a beautiful movie
1,it 's the kind of movie where you 're supposed to believe the story was a good idea to make a,it 's not that the movie is n't so bad it 's bad and it 's not even worth renting

1,i have to admit i was n't expecting the same thing to be said,i do n't know what to say about this film but it 's a very
1,i'm sure the filmmakers were trying too hard but it just did n't work,i'm not sure if this was a good thing but i think it 's a
1,how can anyone not even think this is a good movie,how can you have a movie that is a complete waste of
1,it is a shame that this is n't a good film,it 's a shame that the movie is a little more enjoyable
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that it has no redeeming features whatsoever,but the film does n't have the feel of a real horror movie or even a scary
1,mom 's mother was the only one who was able to find the killer,mom and daughter decide to leave and go back together with a married couple

1,his character was a little too unlikable to be true to the book but the story and the characters are very good,his character is a stereotype of the book and the film is a bit of a bore to watch and is a very
1,hey it 's all pretty good,hey i know that 's not what

1,stretch out the cast for this one is a great movie,stretch the plot of this film is that the characters were all
1,this movie is not a good film but it is a good film,this is one of those shows that you will never forget about
1,having seen it i have a feeling of nostalgia,having said that i have n't laughed so hard since
1,those are the only reasons why i give this movie a 1 because it 's not a bad idea,those who have n't read the book do n't read the book and do n't read the book
1,this movie is not a good one,this is a great film for those who
1,in the first film the characters have a very different story and the characters are so different and believable and the story is,in the end the movie is a bit too much for me and i do n't think i can remember the title

1,overall it was a very good film and i would highly recommend it to anyone,overall the movie is a complete waste but i think that this film was made for
1,saskia is the only one who has the strength to pull out a good performance and a very good supporting performance from a very talented cast,saskia 's character is the only one that has a motive for the killings and the killer is a little bit more than a little too nerdy
1,released in a time when the world was not a big hit,released in the late 1950 's and was a bit too much for
1,she 's a great singer and she,she is a very talented actress
1,when i saw this movie i was very surprised by,when i saw this film i was n't impressed
1,the movie has some great moments,the film is about a group of
1,but the movie is a bit slow and boring and the ending is so predictable,but this is a movie for those who like to see a good film with a

1,beauty is the best part of the film,beauty and the beast are the best part of
1,i was expecting a lot more from it,i was surprised to learn that this is not
1,cole 's character was so annoying and so unlikable that it could have been a little more interesting to me,cole is a good man and a good guy who is always a good guy but is not a bad actor
1,it 's a pity that the film is not available in dvd,it 's the same thing that the movie is so bad
1,they 're not funny and are n't funny at all,they were so stupid and so unfunny that they had to
1,even if you 're a diehard fan of the genre this is one of the few,even if you are not a fan of the genre you 'll love this movie
1,if you want to watch a good horror movie you should watch this movie,if you have n't already seen this film you will not be disappointed
1,there is a reason to watch this film but it 's still very good,there are many scenes where the characters are introduced as if they are not just
1,it 's not a bad film but it is a good movie,it 's a pity that they have n't wasted a better movie in
1,he is the only person who can,he 's a very talented actor
1,he 's a very talented man,he was a great actor and a
1,that was the best i can see,that 's a shame because it is a
1,the film is about the same thing as,the film is a very interesting one
1,for me the most interesting thing about this film was the fact,for the first time i was looking to see this movie
1,the movie starts with a bang of a car crashing into a lake,the film has some good acting and some of the best scenes are when
1,obviously the movie was shot in the same year as the original,obviously he is a little bit of a jerk to his wife but
1,i have to admit that i am not a fan of the book,i do n't want to spoil the movie for you because you have to
1,secondly it has been a very long time since i saw it in,secondly i do n't think that the movie is a good movie
1,i have seen the movie twice,i have seen this movie many times
1,anyway i think that this is the best movie i have,anyway this movie is n't a total waste of time
1,i have seen this film countless times and i can honestly say that the film was great,i was surprised that the director did n't have a clue that he was in the movie for
1,perhaps it is because of its lack of budget,perhaps the director was aiming to get the audience to
1,rating 12 stars out of 5 stars,rating 3 out of 10 stars
1,in this film the director is not a director,in this case the film has been made in the
1,the acting is pretty good but the plot is so bad that,the film has a very nice soundtrack and a nice pace
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a theatrical release in the uk,it is a movie with a lot of good action and some good action sequences
1,title o o e e o n,title o e e da da da da
1,this movie is a must see,this is a movie that is n't
1,finally the story of the movie is about a,finally the movie is a bit too long
1,however it 's a very good movie and the acting is,however the film is not as bad as the first
1,one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,one thing i can do is that the director did not
1,boyd and jane are not the same,boyd 's character is a little more believable
1,poirot is the only actor i can recall,poirot is a master of the macabre
1,in fact the film has a lot of problems and the story is not that bad,in fact i think the director was trying too hard to be funny but it was n't
1,i was n't impressed with the acting and the plot,i have n't seen this since i saw it on cable
1,this is a very bad movie,this film is so awful that i
1,multiple maniacs are a bunch of kids,multiple of the actors are the only redeeming
1,somewhere along the way he is a young boy with his family,somewhere in the movie there 's a scene where a woman is murdered
1,maybe it is because i do n't know,maybe it was the director 's fault
1,i have to admit that i was n't expecting too much from the film,i was expecting the worst movie i 've ever seen but it was a waste
1,actually i do n't think that the director was trying to,actually i do n't know what the director was thinking
1,mccoy and his friends and their son and the two are both very good,mccoy is a great villain and i have always loved his acting skills

1,i do n't think i have ever seen,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,the movie was n't even good,the film is not a comedy but
1,regardless the movie is a little bit too long for me,regardless of the lack of the story of this movie i was
1,also a lot of scenes are shot in slowmotion and the camera work,also i think this is the best movie i have ever seen
1,however the film has a very good plot,however the movie was a bit too long for
1,it 's a great story about love love love and,it 's not that it 's a bad thing
1,for the most part the acting is terrible and the script is so lame that the audience is laughing,for those who are interested in the subject of wwii and the holocaust of the late 1960s this film is
1,the film is very well done,the film is a complete waste of
1,by the end of the film you 'll have to see,by the way this was a great film for me
1,nick stahl is the best of the bunch,nick stahl plays a very funny guy who is
1,i'm a fan of the series and the movie was so bad that it was,i'm a fan of the original but this one is a waste of time
1,a few minutes later i saw the,a good film to be sure
1,after all it was the most boring movie ever made,after seeing a movie that was made by a young woman
1,john goodman plays a character who is the best of the bunch and he does not disappoint as a result,john goodman plays a young man who is a struggling man who has to cope with the fact that his mother
1,you have the feeling of being a great film maker,you can tell that the film is a bit slow but
1,stargate sg1 is a great show,stargate sg1 is a film about a
1,there 's also a good amount of gore,there is a scene where a man is walking
1,one day he meets a young girl in the woods,one of the most memorable movies i have seen
1,in the meantime of the story the characters are introduced,in the end the film is a bit slow
1,colleen moore plays the part of the woman,colleen turner is also excellent as always
1,fun to see but the film is n't as bad,fun to watch but it 's not as good
1,invite the audience to the next level of,invite the viewer to the next generation
1,she is the one who has the ability to be in the end,she has a lot of talent and has a lot to work with but
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so much a bit more interesting and the acting in this film is,i do n't know what the director wanted to make but i did not see the point of this movie
1,viggo mortensen was a great choice for his,viggo mortensen is excellent as the villain
1,for me the only thing that kept me from watching,for the record i have to give it 10
1,andre 's father is the son of the father of his father and his father is the son of a family,andre and his friends and their son and his wife are both very attractive in a way that is a real treat
1,i do n't understand why this movie was so awful but it,i was expecting the movie to end with a good story
1,the film is a complete mess of a film that is so utterly devoid of,the film 's plot is very simple and is not a very good one
1,he 's not the only one to be killed in his first movie,he 's not the only actor in the movie that 's not even worth
1,it was so bad that it made me laugh,it 's not that the acting was n't bad but
1,charlize theron is one of those who should have won the oscar for this movie,charlize theron plays a woman who 's a little too old to be married to her
1,the film is not a bad thing but it is a,the film is a little slow but it 's not
1,my friend and i went to see this film and we were n't impressed with the fact that the movie was a total,my friend and i were in the theater and i was laughing at the tv and it 's not funny at all

1,the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain awful,the acting was good and the plot was a little weak
1,the film has a lot of action and a lot of plot holes and the ending is very predictable but the ending is a,the film is a bit long and the story is n't that interesting and the story is n't as bad as the book

1,the film has a very good plot and a nice pace,the film is about a young girl who is sent to prison
1,i have seen this show several times and i can still remember the show,i was so disappointed that i had wasted my money and time watching this movie
1,it was n't a movie for the masses,it 's just that the story is so bad
1,gregory peck is a good actor but he was not convincing as the lead actor in this movie,gregory 's father is an old man and the mother of a family man is the daughter
1,the movie is a bit slow but i do n't think that the director should,the film is not as funny as the original but the acting is superb
1,thee 's performance is a bit of an exaggeration,thee is a good actress but the script is so
1,we are left wondering why the movie was made,we are not sure if it is a comedy or
1,i do n't know why this was,i was n't expecting anything more
1,ursus is a very funny movie,ursus is a great character actor who
1,federico is a great actor and i can see that he has a great,federico is a very talented actor and he is perfect in this role

1,the movie has a lot of action and the story,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,since the movie was so much better it was a good movie,since the film is a comedy it has a lot of fun and
1,the acting was n't as good as i expected,the film is about a young woman who lives on
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring,the film is a bit of an insult to
1,the film has some nice moments in the movie but the story is so predictable and so boring,the movie was shot on location in the early seventies but i did n't see the movie
1,it 's just a little bit of a shame that,it was a great show and i liked it
1,you have to see this movie if only to,you have to see it to believe it
1,impressive acting and an excellent cast,impressive acting from the entire cast
1,about the only thing that i found interesting was the fact that it was,about the only redeeming qualities i can remember was the acting and acting
1,i have n't seen this movie since it 's made,i have never been so disgusted by this movie
1,of course he 's a bit too old for the role but he is very likable,of course there 's a lot of action in it but it does n't matter
1,a very enjoyable and entertaining film,a lot of people who have commented
1,if you 're not a fan of this genre you 'll be disappointed,if you 're a fan of the original series or the series i would
1,she 's a little bit more than a bit,she 's the best thing about this movie

1,it is the worst movie i have,it 's a very good film
1,their relationship with each other is a little jarring but the,their relationship is not as good as the first one
1,one of the few films that i 've seen so,one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,the film has some good moments in it,the acting is horrible the script is awful the
1,now i have to say i am a fan of the original,now the plot has been done before but the movie is a bit
1,i have to say the movie was a complete waste of time,i have to say that this movie is a total waste of time
1,the film is very funny and is not just a comedy,the film is a complete waste of time and money
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film is a very good film and i
1,at the end of his career i was a little surprised by the fact that this,at the end of this film i was thinking about how the movie was made
1,he was a great actor and he had the right blend of talent,he is a very talented actor and he 's always a joy to watch
1,it is a shame that this movie did n't get released theatrically and the dvd release has been a,it is not even the story of a young woman who gets a chance to be a mother
1,as the movie goes on the movie becomes a little bit too long,as a fan of the book the film has a certain amount of charm
1,but the film is a complete mess,but the real problem with this movie is
1,even the acting is n't bad,even when the film 's final moments
1,although the movie is a bit slow paced the acting is pretty good and the story line is very good,although i have seen a lot of movies and have seen them all i can say that i am not a
1,i was n't really sure what to expect from this film but it is a good movie,i think the film is a very good example of how not to do a film about a
1,it 's not a good movie but it is a fun,it 's not a good film but it 's not
1,i was expecting a good movie but it did n't,i was expecting a lot from this movie but this is
1,that 's why the film is so bad that it,that 's the best way to describe this movie
1,that 's what makes it so good,that is the only reason why i give
1,it is not a bad movie but it is a great film,it is a shame that the film is so bad that it is
1,surely the best part is that they are,surely the film is not a comedy
1,and i have no idea why this film is so,and i think it is a very good movie
1,if it were not for the fact that they had to make an appearance in the film,if you are into this kind of thing then you will probably be a better person
1,all in all this movie is a waste of money and time,all the actors and actresses are good but the script is n't bad
1,from there the story unfolds in a way that is n't even remotely believable,from the very first scene where the killer is shot in the head with the
1,aside from that it 's not a good movie,aside from this the film is a complete mess
1,at one time the film was shot in black and white and it 's a very long time to have seen it in a theater,at first i was surprised to see how many of these movies are so bad that they do not deserve to have been released
1,i do n't know how this movie got such a low rating,i have seen the original movie and it 's a great film that
1,catherine zetajones is excellent and she is very good in her role as the mother,catherine deneuve is a wonderful actress and is very good in this movie but the acting
1,he 's the only person in the movie that is not so bad he is a real bore,he is also in the movie and i do not think he was in a movie that was so
1,it is a very simple film that is a joy,it is a movie that will appeal to everyone
1,it has a very nice atmosphere and the acting is excellent,it 's a shame that the film has n't got a theatrical
1,without a shadow of a doubt the worst is the scene where,without any spoilers i would n't even have seen this movie
1,there is no real reason to watch this film unless you 're a fan of the original and the,there 's no real plot to speak of and the whole film feels like a home video game
1,the story is about two young men who go into their own business to find,the film has no redeeming qualities to the film and the acting is terrible
1,you know it is a good movie,you 'll be glad you did
1,this is the best of the four,this is a very good movie and i
1,however the film is a little too long for its parts,however it 's a shame that this movie did n't get made
1,fortunately this film is not for everyone,fortunately the story is not very well done
1,i was expecting a good movie,i was n't expecting a lot from
1,why is it the only movie i can think of again,why did the farmers keep the same man in the first place
1,right now you can see the difference between the two and the two of them,right away the movie is a little slow but that is what i thought it was
1,much of the film 's plot is centered on the events of the book and the events that occur in,much like a film of the sort it 's the story and characters that are all over the place
1,nonetheless i was n't expecting much from it but i did n't expect a lot more,nonetheless this is a very bad movie with a very bad script and poor direction
1,his character is a caricature of a man who 's been reduced to a mental institution,his character is a bit dim and he does n't even seem to care for his actions
1,all of the characters are very likable and the story is very good,all in all a great movie for those who love the book
1,it 's just a bunch of random characters,it is a great movie and i recommend it
1,the movie was a complete waste of time,the film is a bit of a mess
1,third the plot line is pretty bad and the ending was pretty bad,third of all i do n't think it was a good idea to make
1,the movie is a little slow but i think the movie has a very good cast,the film has some good acting and a good plot but it does not work
1,if you have seen this film i recommend you to watch the movie,if you are looking for a film to watch with a group of friends
1,i was so excited about the movie,i have to admit that the acting was
1,not to mention the fact that he was n't a good actor but he is,not that i do n't think that the film is anything like the movie
1,sure it is n't that great but,sure there are some good points
1,i was n't impressed by the film and i did n't care,i was n't really surprised that the story was n't so bad and
1,if you have n't seen the first movie you will be disappointed,if you 're looking for something that will be a good idea for
1,the film has a lot of problems and the ending is so abrupt that it becomes,the movie was made in the seventies and it 's not even a good movie
1,i have seen it three times and i have to say i was,i have n't seen the first one but this one did it
1,a few years later i saw a preview for this movie and it was the worst movie i,a few years later the young girl is a young woman and the mother of the family
1,i think that 's a problem since the first time i saw it i was so scared that i had never seen the movie,i was so impressed by the story and the performances of the characters that i could not believe that the movie was actually filmed in
1,at the end of his rope he realizes that he has been,at the end of the day i was a little confused
1,the movie is not a comedy,the movie is a complete mess and
1,friend of a bitch and the two men are,friend 's son is a very funny one
1,with the exception of a few other actors in a film it is a little too long to be able,with the exception of a few other movies this is a great example of what a film should be
1,his performance is very good as well as a few of the supporting cast members,his wife is the one who gets the job and is a bit too old to
1,let 's just say that it 's just not funny,let 's just say that the film is n't bad it
1,the acting is pretty good but it is not as good as the original,the film is a bit long and the story is not that great
1,the film is a little slow and the acting is poor,the film is a bit slow moving with a few twists and
1,i was n't expecting anything from this movie and i did n't even get it but,i was n't expecting much from this movie but it was a waste of time
1,there 's a very interesting plot twist that is very well done and the film has a nice atmosphere and a good pace,there are a number of scenes that are so funny and so memorable that it 's difficult to understand the characters and the characters
1,aside from the aforementioned plot the movie is just too boring and too slow for the audience,aside from the fact that the film is a comedy it 's not very funny and is a
1,the movie is not a comedy,the film is a very interesting and
1,and that 's what i thought,and the film is a bit slow
1,the movie is a very funny film and a,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,it 's a shame that the film,it 's a very funny movie
1,the film has a few good points but it 's not,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,for a film that is a real treat to watch and is a film that,for the first time the only thing worse than this movie was the music
1,without the aid of a man who would have been a little more,without the aid of the original the story is n't very good
1,there 's no need to see a movie where it is not,there are some funny moments but the rest is a bit too long
1,all the actors are all good and i have,all in all this is a good movie
1,i'm not sure if it 's the director,i'm a fan of the original series
1,i have n't seen it in years and it is not a masterpiece,i do n't think that a movie is ever made to entertain people but
1,where the hell is the ending,where was the plot and the characters
1,i was n't expecting anything much,i was surprised that i had to
1,at first i was a bit puzzled when i heard the name of it,at first i thought that it would be a good movie but i was n't
1,so the film was a bit slow,so the film has a few funny scenes
1,if you 're a fan of the series i would highly recommend this film,if you have seen the first film you 'll know that this one is a
1,it is not a good movie to be seen but it is a very good movie,it 's a shame because it was so bad that i could n't even finish my own
1,they are both a very good movie,they are not funny at all
1,a few scenes are filmed with the camera and the camera work is jerky,a lot of the film is shot on location and it shows that there 's
1,frustration is the key to this movie,frustration and death are not all that bad
1,cotter 's father is one of his best friends and he does n't seem to be in the movie,cotter has a very difficult life and is a little too reluctant to be taken to the hospital
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie,i do not know why this film flopped
1,super mario is a very good film,super 8 is a movie about a man
1,or maybe it is the director of the movie that is not a good,or maybe it was the acting that made it a little more enjoyable
1,thought of this as a movie about a group of young men who are married to a woman who,thought it was an excellent film and i would recommend this film to any fan of the original
1,in the end the movie is n't a bad movie,in the end it 's a very funny movie
1,if you 're a fan of the series i suggest you watch this movie,if you want to watch a movie that is not a good film then you
1,the film 's main character is a young man,the film is a complete waste of time
1,it is a great movie to watch,it 's a shame because this is one
1,with all the shortcomings of a movie i have to say that i was so disappointed with it,with the exception of this movie the film is a very good example of how a director could be
1,a very funny and funny movie,a lot of the scenes in this
1,yes it is a bit of a stretch but the ending is just so ridiculous and so lame that i was n't even sure what the hell was going on,yes it is n't a good idea to have to rely on the story of a young man who is a bit of a geena davis lookalike but a good actor
1,screenwriter john hughes has a very good sense of humor,screenwriter david cronenberg is the master of this genre
1,basically this is the first film i saw that i saw and the,basically this is the kind of movie that you can enjoy watching
1,furthermore the film is a bit long for,furthermore the film is very well done
1,well this movie is a must watch,well it 's a good movie
1,this movie is not even funny,this movie has the same amount of
1,and the ending was just a little too predictable,and the ending was a little too abrupt for me
1,if you have a choice to watch a film with a good script and good acting then this movie is for,if you want to see a good movie about the hardships of the characters this is the one to see
1,all in all it 's a good movie,all in all this is a good movie
1,nightclubs are not bad but they are n't good,nightclubs and the movie is not the best of them
1,romantic comedies were not funny but they,romantic comedy and a good story
1,abc 's the big hit and the sopranos is a great film,abc 's version of the classic version of the classic novel was a
1,this movie is a great example of what a movie should be,this movie has the potential to become one of my favorite movies of
1,it was a good movie and i was n't too impressed,it 's a great story about the hardships and tribulations of the
1,this is not one of those films that you,this film is so much fun to watch
1,annoying and dumber the movie is a,annoying and stupid and not funny
1,what is with all the good points,what is the purpose of making a film
1,heck the film is a bit of a disappointment,heck the movie was so bad it was funny
1,having said the acting is excellent the story line is very good,having seen this movie i was impressed with how the movie is set
1,the film was shot in color,the movie is a complete waste of
1,several times i have a feeling of deja vu that is so bad it 's almost,several scenes of the movie are filmed with a lot of footage from the movie
1,you can tell they were watching the rushes for the first time,you know it 's going to be a bad movie but it 's
1,worst of all is that there is n't a,worst of all there 's nothing to recommend
1,what is the point of this movie,what is the deal with the film
1,trouble is that the film is not a good film,trouble was that the film was a total flop
1,to me the movie was made in spain and the film is a very good film,to be honest i do n't think i 've ever heard of this film and i have
1,sure it 's not as bad as some other movies but it does n't,sure it 's a great story but it 's still a great movie
1,pity that you can see the same movie in the first,pity is the word that this film is based on
1,when i first saw this movie i thought that it was pretty funny,when the movie was released it was released in the united states
1,for me the only thing that i can say about this film is,for me this is a film that should be watched for all
1,this is a very good film and a very good one,this is a great example of what the film has done to
1,he is not a good actor and he is not a great director,he is the best of his kind of films but he does n't have
1,killed by the devil 's mother and a woman who 's a child and a man with a crush on the man,killed in the middle of the film and the first one is a bit slow and the second is n't as good as
1,i have never seen such a great cast of,i do n't know what it was about
1,because the movie is so bad it 's good,because of the great acting and the wonderful performances from
1,it is a very simple and touching story about a woman who 's lost her husband and her son,it has been done by other people who do n't know that the movie is based on a true story
1,did they get the chance to see the movie,did n't it just be the same movie
1,the film was made for a very long time,the acting is very good the characters are well written
1,in the end it is a very good film,in the first film the main character was a young
1,i have to admit that i was a little disappointed by how bad the movie was,i have to say i was very impressed when i saw this film in the theater when
1,thank goodness the movie has a good,thank you for listening to me
1,i have seen a lot of films but this one just does not seem like it,i think the film 's greatest strength is to show the world of people that are capable
1,i do n't know what to say but it is the most entertaining,i do n't think that a movie like this can be made
1,wow i 've seen this film several times,wow it is a good movie to watch with
1,this is one of the best films ever,this is one movie you should watch if you
1,for the rest of it you can tell the director was trying to make the,for those who have n't seen the movie yet do n't read the book
1,but the story is n't that good,but the film 's plot is a bit
1,a good example of what a movie should be,a few years later the film has a very good
1,as a fan of a film i can appreciate the,as for the film it 's very well done
1,a lot of people who have reviewed,a very interesting and interesting film
1,he is a good actor but he is just plain awful,he was a little bit too old for this role
1,one of the most underrated movies ever made,one day the guy is a teenager and the
1,the movie is about a young woman who,the acting in this movie is horrible
1,i have seen it many times and i have never been able,i was n't sure whether the movie was intentional or not
1,perhaps he 's trying too hard to be cool but this is a very good movie to watch,perhaps the most memorable thing is the fact that this was a movie that was n't a comedy at
1,it is not the type of movie that is n't even worth a rental,it is a shame that it was n't released on dvd in theaters
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot is so predictable,the film is very well acted and the characters are very likable and believable
1,no one has ever seen a film that has such an,no one has ever been able to see the movie
1,the acting is pretty good but the plot is just plain awful,the film is a little too slow for the audience to enjoy
1,and the acting is so bad that it is hard to watch,and i do n't know if it 's a comedy or a comedy
1,as a result the film is very well photographed but it does,as for the rest of the cast they are very good
1,i was n't expecting anything more from the actors but i did,i was so impressed with that i could n't believe it
1,he is a very talented actor,he is a good actor but he
1,something that i would have thought was more entertaining,something about the story of a girl who is married
1,in fact the whole movie is a mess of a film,in fact it 's not that good to begin with
1,be warned that this movie is n't as good as it is and i do n't think that it is worth watching,be warned that the movie is a complete failure and i would rather watch the movie than i could possibly be
1,my advice to everyone who is interested in seeing the film,my advice for the movie is that you do n't have to
1,he 's the one to blame,he was the only person to be
1,it 's a shame that such an,it is n't even a movie
1,credentials is not to be missed by the director and the actors,credentials of a film that is n't as good as the first
1,make sure you 're not in a bad mood,make me laugh at a few things but this is
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who go to a small village in the middle of nowhere,the film is a complete failure to watch and it is n't even the story of two characters
1,when i saw this i thought it was a very funny movie and it was fun to watch,when the film is over and over again it 's a pity that this movie is a complete waste
1,there is a scene where a young boy,there was no plot to the film
1,our hero and his wife and the rest of the cast have been a bit too numerous,our hero and his wife are the only ones that really have a good sense of humor
1,that 's what the story was like and the characters were so believable,that said i did n't know what to expect and i do n't want
1,sarah michelle gellar and her husband are the best of all,sarah silverman 's performance is a bit over the top but the
1,the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the acting was bad but i really enjoyed it,the movie is about a young man named krishna who is sent to prison by the government to help
1,every character has a personality and a sense of humour,every character was a stereotype of a man who is n't
1,first off the acting is horrible,first of all it is the story
1,the film is a complete mess,the film has a lot of action
1,long live the first time he was a teenager and his wife is a man who is a child,long before the movie was over the top and the movie was just plain awful i could have had a
1,also the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending,also the film has an underlying message about it
1,but the movie has a lot of problems in the plot,but i do n't think it 's a great film
1,when i saw it i was n't expecting much,when he finally gets to the bottom of the building
1,one thing i did want to know was that i,one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,in fact it is a great movie,in fact i think this film is a
1,this was one of the most beautiful movies i ever saw,this film is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,since the first time he was on the set he was a big star for the part of the movie he was the most annoying character in the movie,since the first half of the film is a bit slow paced and the characters are not developed well enough it seems to be a little too slow for them
1,weather to the movie and the movie is not a,weather to say the least the film is not
1,the film is a complete failure,the movie is a bit too long
1,sophie 's character is the best thing in the whole movie,sophie 's father and his mother 's daughter are also a bit
1,the movie was a complete waste of my time i,the acting was good and the acting is great
1,also i think that this movie was a big mistake,also the film is a bit of a stretch
1,one of the worst films i ever saw in my life,one thing that is missing is how much the movie is a
1,it 's the story of a young man who is a man who is,it is not a movie that i would watch over and over again
1,costarring as the mother of a woman,costarring the great barbara steele as the wife
1,instead of having a good time with a film that 's,instead we are treated to a very poorly written script
1,the acting is good with the two main characters in this movie,the movie is about a group of people who have to go to
1,she is a very talented woman and a very beautiful woman,she 's not a very talented actress but she is not a
1,the film is not a documentary but it 's an interesting film that does not have a lot of action and it is,the movie has some great scenes in it and the movie 's plot is a good idea but the movie is not
1,the acting is horrible and the script is so stupid that it 's hard to follow,the story was n't too bad but it did have a few funny moments and the ending
1,it 's a pity because the plot was n't that good,it 's a very funny movie with a great cast
1,i was surprised by the way the story unfolded,i have to say i was n't impressed with the
1,neither of the characters are particularly interesting and the,neither is it the best of the genre
1,i have never been so compelled to write,i have to say i was impressed
1,three of the most memorable scenes of a classic film noir are,three men in a small village in the middle of nowhere
1,but it 's a great film and i recommend it to all,but i do n't think that this is a bad film
1,i have never seen the movie but i think that this,i was expecting a good story but it did n't
1,i was expecting something more than a little more than the average movie,i do n't think that this movie is a waste of time
1,it was a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone,it 's a pity that the movie did n't get a theatrical release
1,anyone who has ever read this knows what to do with the movie,anyone who thinks this movie should be enjoyed by a group of children is
1,some of the scenes are very funny,some of the acting is good
1,sometimes it 's just that bad,sometimes i have seen the original and
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie has an interesting premise but
1,right now the film is a bit,right up there with the best
1,it is the best movie i have ever seen and i will say this is my favorite of,it 's the kind of movie you can watch over a weekend and have a few beers
1,that 's what i thought it would be,that 's the only reason i can think of
1,the film is a little bit of a mess and the acting is pretty good,the movie starts out with a couple of people trying to find a cure to a
1,the film is a very good film and it is a very moving film,the acting is pretty good but i think it 's the worst movie i 've
1,either way i do n't care what,either way the acting was terrible
1,in the meantime he is a very good actor,in a way this movie does n't seem to have
1,the film has a very interesting and interesting,the movie is a little too long
1,suddenly the film begins to drag and the viewer gets to the end and the ending,suddenly it 's a good thing that the film is so much fun to watch
1,this was a great movie and the,this movie is a complete mess
1,he is a very talented character,he 's the only person who can
1,despite the title this is a great film to watch with a few friends,despite being a fan of the original film i was impressed to find that the
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and money,this is a movie that is n't even worth watching for
1,if you are looking for a good horror movie you should see this movie,if you have not seen the movie you will find it a little more enjoyable
1,before you know that it is a great film it 's a good movie,before the movie is over you will find a lot of things to say about
1,in a way this film is a complete failure,in fact the movie was so bad that i could
1,this movie is a great movie that is n't a waste of,this is a very funny film and i really enjoyed it
1,kudos to the writers for making the best of this,kudos to the director for putting on a good film
1,it is a shame that the filmmakers decided,it is a great movie to watch
1,the film was a complete waste of time,the movie has some good moments and the story
1,when the movie was made and it was a little bit of a letdown it was a little too,when you 're in the mood for a good laugh you 're not going to get a laugh
1,not to mention the fact that the film was shot in a studio and edited by the,not a great film but it 's not a bad movie and the acting is terrible
1,in fact the movie is a bit too long,in this movie it 's a very good film
1,excellent acting great direction and great music,excellent performances by all of the actors
1,its just not a good show,its the kind of film where the
1,tom hanks is the only one who,tom cruise is a great actor
1,the acting is very poor the plot is a bit weak and the plot is n't that great,the movie is about the struggle between the two men and it 's a bit of a stretch to
1,no matter what it is the movie is a complete mess of a film,no matter how many times you see the movie you will probably be laughing at
1,quaid is the only one who has the ability to pull the trigger,quaid and his wife and the two are in a class together
1,the film is a very good film and a very good one,the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous and the acting is horrible
1,resistant to the film is a story of the same name and the same story,resistant to the story of a man who 's not a good guy he 's just
1,he 's not the most convincing character in the world,he is a very talented director and a very funny one
1,as i watched this movie i had to wonder how many times it,as the title suggests the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,for those of you who are not familiar with the,for the most part the characters are very likable
1,though i have n't seen this movie i do n't want to see it again,though this movie has been made by a bunch of kids who do n't get it
1,all of this is the only thing that makes it worthwhile for a movie like this,all the characters are all so likable that i have to give this a 1 out of
1,nobody else has ever seen the movie,nobody is a good guy but the movie
1,but i have to say that the film is a little too,but it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
1,if you have n't seen it you will probably like the movie,if you want something different than the first movie this is the one
1,why do they make such a bad movie,why do we need to be a part of
1,the movie is a complete waste of,the movie is a complete mess
1,but it 's a good movie,but i do n't want to spoil
1,so i have to say that this is the best of the three,so the film is about the only thing that can be said about this
1,and i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece of the original or even the,and that 's why i think that the movie has a lot to do with it
1,two of the most memorable scenes in the film are the ones where the hero 's wife is shot in a car and the camera pans off the screen and the scene where he 's walking through an airport and the scene of the,two of the most memorable scenes are the ones with the mother and the woman in the bar and the girl who is the one in the room and the scene where she 's in her room with a woman in a room
1,it is not even the case with the original,it is the best movie i 've seen in years
1,one thing i can say is that the acting was good,one thing that makes this a good film is the fact that
1,in the first half of the movie the,in fact it is a great movie
1,i was n't really expecting anything more,i was expecting a good movie
1,all in all a good film,all the while i think that this
1,it is a great movie and a good one at that,it is a great movie and it is a must see
1,as a matter of fact i do not understand what to expect,as a matter of fact there was no real reason for the film
1,as the film continues the film is a bit slow paced,as the film continues the story is a bit confusing
1,it 's a shame because the movie is n't as bad as the first two,it 's a shame that this movie has not been seen in the us since its
1,i have to say the film was a little too slow,i was n't expecting much from it but it was a good
1,i have seen this movie several times and still have a fondness for the movie and the fact that it is so good,i have to wonder how this movie could be released theatrically and i do n't think that it was a waste of time
1,bad acting horrible acting and a lot of bad acting,bad acting poor script poor acting and a bad story
1,there are some good performances in the movie but it is a bit too long and too long,there is a scene in which the two men get married and the other two are the ones who
1,si is a very good example of how a film should be,si i have to admit that i was n't disappointed with this movie
1,much better than most of the other reviews i,much better than i expected this to be
1,i was so bored to see the first episode,i think that the film is a bit of a
1,the film is about as much fun as it,the film is a complete waste of time
1,while the film is a bit slow at first it is not a good film,while the movie is n't the best it 's a bad one and a lot better
1,of course there is the usual clich of the film 's first half,of course the story is n't all that bad and the acting is bad
1,he is a very talented man who has a heart,he is a great actor and he is a joy
1,this film is a must see for all ages,this is a movie that is n't a complete failure
1,and the acting was n't bad but,and the ending is very abrupt
1,anyway i have seen this film a few times and it 's a great film to watch,anyway the movie is n't that funny and i do n't really know what it is
1,the story is simple enough to make you think,the film has a lot more to it but it
1,i was n't expecting much from this film but it was a great movie,i was expecting a lot of this film but the movie was n't as good
1,what 's more interesting is that the characters are,what 's the point of the film anyway
1,this movie has no plot and no real acting,this movie is a must see for all fans of
1,the movie was a little slow but it was a good film,the film is a very interesting film that does not have any redeeming
1,let me start off by saying that i have never heard of it,let me just say that this is the best of the series
1,think that this is the best film ever made,think that it 's a good movie and a good
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this was a great movie for me to watch
1,for a film like this it was a very good movie,for a film that is a little more interesting and more entertaining
1,hopefully it is n't a movie,hopefully it 's not a bad idea
1,how did they get it in a movie,how did they get to the point where this
1,sure this movie is not as good as,sure it 's not a good movie
1,i was surprised by the amount of violence that was put into the film,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot was very confusing
1,somebody else should have done this movie a little,somebody is a little more forgiving than this
1,i was expecting a lot more than the movie,i have to admit i am a huge fan of
1,i was surprised to see the film on the cover,i think the movie is a good example of how a
1,he 's not the only actor that i have,he is the best actor of all time
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by the story and the characters,i was n't expecting much from it and i was expecting the same to be a
1,how many times do we see a,how could this movie be made
1,it was a waste of time and money,it 's a very simple film that has the
1,there is a scene in the film where the camera is shot in the head of an old man in a scene,there 's a very good reason to be a fan of a movie that has a lot more to offer than this one
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed,i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about
1,instantly enough the movie is a bit too long but it 's a bit of a disappointment to see the ending of the movie,instantly the movie is about as bad as a brick 's tail and the movie is a bit too long for its own good
1,should i have known the film,should i say this is the worst
1,ennio morricone is the best director in the world,ennio morricone is the best actor of the lot and
1,i do n't know how it got a pg rating but it 's not a good one,i have n't seen a movie in years but i have to give it a chance
1,there is no reason for it and the acting is,there are many scenes that do n't make sense
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this film is so bad it makes it hard
1,both of them have been a staple of their lives,both films offer an insight into the lives of the people
1,whatever i think is a good movie i think i will have to watch a lot of movies but this one was just so,whatever the case the director should not have taken a film to make it a little more enjoyable and a little more entertaining
1,the movie is very well done but the story is n't too bad,the movie is a little slow but it does not have a lot of
1,it is n't a good film but the acting is good the story is good and there 's a lot of great scenes in this movie,it 's just a bunch of random characters that make you think of the worst movie i have ever seen but this one is so bad that
1,maybe i missed something but i did n't care for the rest of the,maybe it 's a bit too long and too much of a complaint
1,although it 's not as much fun as the first one it is,although it 's not a bad movie it 's a good movie
1,talbot is one of those movies that you can enjoy and you can tell the director was trying to be,talbot is a good actor but the movie has a lot of action and a lot of action scenes
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this was a very poor film with a
1,it 's not that i do n't know what i mean,it 's not a bad film but a good one
1,were there a lot of people in this movie who did n't know how to act in a,were we to believe that he was the one who had the best friend of the child
1,dad is a great actor who is a great actor but he does n't really do much,dad and daughter have a relationship that is both the same and the two men who have been
1,i was so impressed by the fact that i was so engrossed in the story,i have to admit that i have seen the original version of the scarlet pimpernel and

1,again it was n't even that good to be,again i think the film is very good

1,john huston is a great director and i do think that the film is a good one to watch,john wayne 's portrayal of a man who has to be the most complex person ever to be in the
1,that 's a big problem for the whole thing to be made,that 's the only thing that made me laugh and cry

1,this is a movie that is not only,this is a great movie for everyone
1,i have seen the movie and i have seen the,i do n't know what to call a movie

1,ving is a great actor and i hope,ving rhames 's character is a stereotype
1,tim robbins plays the father and wife,tim robbins is great as always
1,that 's what makes this movie a classic,that 's the only reason why the movie is
1,he 's the only person who can make it a good movie,he is also the only one to get his own life

1,in the end he 's just a little bit too much of a loser but that is n't enough,in fact this was a very funny movie that i could n't watch because of the good performances
1,so i have a lot of time,so i guess i was wrong

1,there are some funny moments but it does n't really make sense,there is a lot of violence in the movie that is n't really
1,somewhere in the movie you get an idea of how a movie is going to end,somewhere in the middle of the road he finds the body of the dead woman and her
1,so if you 're looking for a good movie with,so i guess i 'll give it a go
1,nonetheless i think that the movie is worth seeing,nonetheless i think that 's the best part of the
1,pity the movie is n't as good as it should be,pity that the director did n't make a movie about the holocaust
1,she was a very nice guy and i was very impressed with her,she 's the only one who knows how to act like a normal girl

1,it 's the kind of movie you 'd watch on the big,it is a very funny film with some very funny scenes
1,like the other two movies it is n't that great,like i said i was very impressed when i saw the
1,now the plot is n't that good and i think it 's a good film,now the movie was a little slow and i was expecting a lot more

1,it 's not a movie that i would n't watch as,it was a waste of time and money and time
1,when i first saw it i was n't impressed by the story,when the film finally ended i was left wondering if the director was
1,the acting was n't bad the story,the film is a complete bore
1,nothing is ever explained or explained in,nothing is ever shown on screen
1,i have never been a big fan of his work but this was one of the best,i have to admit that i have to say that this movie is one of the worst i

1,the movie was a complete waste of my time,the film is a bit slow but it 's still
1,the film is a bit slow moving,the story of a man who is trying
1,i do n't think i 've watched any other movie,i have to agree that this movie was made in the
1,steven spielberg is the master of the genre,steven spielberg 's direction was very good and the
1,then there 's the fact that it 's a comedy,then the movie is a bit of a joke and the

1,i was n't expecting a lot,i have n't seen the first movie
1,lol i do not know why,lol i do n't care if this
1,but it was a great idea,but the film 's biggest flaw was
1,while the film is a little dated it has a good deal to it,while the film is n't as bad as the other two films i have seen
1,dermot mulroney plays the character who is a little too young for the role of a lifetime,dermot mulroney is excellent in his portrayal of a man who is trying to solve the mystery of
1,jim carrey is the best in this movie and he,jim carrey plays a very likable and sensitive man

1,it was a very funny movie and a great one,it is not the best film of the year but it
1,the film is a bit of a disappointment,the acting is pretty good but the script is
1,i do not think this movie is the best of the bunch,i think that the movie is a good example of how a movie

1,every time i watch it it is a joy to behold,every time he opened his mouth he could have made a movie
1,the film is about the struggle between a group of people and a,the acting was n't too bad and the script was pretty lame

1,i was n't sure whether i had seen the movie or not but i do n't,i was expecting a lot of the film but i found the ending very disappointing
1,the film is not a complete mess but rather a movie that,the acting was good and the story was very well done
1,from the opening scene of the film the film is very much a bit slow and the ending feels like a cross between the,from the beginning i thought the acting was pretty decent the story was interesting but the story and characters were just too weak

1,cyborgs have been a staple of the,cyborgs are not always the same
1,if you are looking for the real story you should definitely see the movie,if the movie is so good you can see it at the end
1,i was surprised to see the film on the dvd box,i was expecting something more than a little less pretentious and i
1,an interesting premise for a film,an old fashioned man with a heart
1,and the acting in general is good,and the ending was so predictable that it
1,i was n't sure what to expect,i do n't want to spoil the movie
1,this movie is a must for anyone who likes a movie that is n't afraid,this was a great story for the first two movies and it was n't
1,something that is not only a vehicle for,something is missing in the first place
1,and it does not matter that the story is n't a good thing,and it 's a great shame that they did n't get it

1,i do n't think it was the fault of the film,i do n't know what the hell happened to this movie but
1,more importantly it 's a very good movie,more than just a bunch of random characters the
1,while it does n't matter what it 's supposed to be it 's a good movie,while the plot was a little weak i was expecting more of the same kind of thing
1,sure it 's a bit too slow for me,sure there were plenty of good movies and this one
1,very few movies were released on dvd,very good film with excellent acting and a
1,the acting was n't great but there was a lot of good acting,the movie is not about a man who has a heart attack
1,i was so disappointed by the film and the plot was n't that interesting,i was n't sure whether it was the same guy who played the first film
1,both of these actors are great and it has,both films are so bad they 're funny
1,while it 's not exactly perfect it was still very enjoyable,while it is n't as good as the first one it still
1,since the film 's main drawback is that it is the only film that has been made in recent years it 's,since the movie is about the same thing as a whole i would say i would like to see the movie
1,the acting was horrible the story was awful the acting was awful and the script was just awful,the movie starts out as a typical teen slasher flick and is n't even funny at all
1,it 's not a great film it 's a good film to watch,it 's not a movie that will make you laugh and it will probably
1,it was a very nice movie to watch,it was a great show for me
1,you know it 's not going to be a bad,you can tell that it 's a good thing
1,the acting is very good the script and the directing,the acting was horrible the story was awful but the acting
1,while i do n't know what the appeal of it is to have been,while it does n't work for me it 's just a fun movie

1,its a shame that this movie was not available on dvd,its not a movie that is not a total waste
1,this is a very funny movie and i,this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,however the plot is n't as bad as the book and it has some,however i do not know how this is going to be a film
1,only one of the main characters is in the movie that is the only one who has to face the whole thing,only one thing is that it is not a bad movie and it is a bit of a stretch to sit through
1,every time she is in a place she has the ability to be a bit more believable,every time i see this i will just conclude that i do n't know how to describe it
1,the film is a bit of a,the film is very well done
1,it 's a shame that this is a movie about a man who 's not even a good guy,it 's a shame because the movie is a little too much for me but it 's a very good
1,so what i was expecting was a very good film,so i guess i can see that the movie is a
1,in fact it 's a shame that it was released theatrically in the uk and that 's why i did n't like it,in this film it 's a bit of a stretch to see a man who is a bit of an actor but is n't
1,the story is about a group of people who are trying to get married and have a,the movie was shot in black but i did n't know that it was a movie
1,the film was made by the same director as the blair witch project but the acting is so,the movie starts with a bunch of people walking around the woods and then they get killed
1,art carney 's character is the best thing in the movie,art direction is the best i have ever seen in my life
1,now i have a lot of time to say,now i have to say this is a great movie

1,it 's a shame that the film,it 's a very bad movie
1,to be honest i did n't know it was a comedy but it was n't,to me it was the best performance in the entire movie but i was not impressed
1,the film is a complete failure and the acting is horrible,the film is a little slow but the film is a bit
1,that was one of the most interesting parts i had,that 's the only reason i can watch it
1,there is a scene where the two men are sitting,there is a lot of action in this movie
1,i was surprised to find that this film was n't made in the us,i have to say the movie is a little over the top and the acting
1,hagen and the other characters are all pretty good but the film is so bad that it is hard to watch it,hagen 's character is a little bit too unlikable but he is very believable as an actor and his character is a bit
1,why is n't it a bad movie,why did n't she try to save her
1,then the story is about as much as you 'd expect,then the movie goes to a climax where the two main characters
1,so i guess i was n't going to,so the movie is n't that bad
1,sorry i did n't have the patience to watch,sorry but i did n't care about it
1,it is the story of a young girl who is attracted to her son and her mother,it is a very simple and powerful movie that i can only assume that it was a very
1,i'm not a fan of the genre and this is one of those,i'm sure the movie has a lot of fun but it does
1,the film is about a young woman named,the film has a lot of problems
1,noone seems to have any idea what the film was about and that 's about it,noone is able to speak and speak and is n't even remotely funny or funny
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i was surprised to learn that this was
1,he is a very good actor but he is n't a good actor,he was n't a bad guy but he was a good guy
1,there is a scene in which he tells his,there is no real reason for this film
1,arthur lowe is a great actor and i hope his career will be,arthur lowe is a fine choice for his role as the villain
1,an excellent cast of characters that have,an interesting and very entertaining film
1,i was n't expecting a lot,i have n't seen the movie since
1,it 's a very funny movie and,it is a very good movie
1,the film is a little bit too long and it 's not,the film has a very strong plot and some interesting characters
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on,it is a movie about the hardships of the war
1,this movie has been made in many countries,this movie is a waste of time
1,then the movie switches gears and the end is so predictable that you ca n't help but feel sorry for the guy,then again the film is n't a bad film it 's not a great film it 's just a poor film
1,this movie is not a bad movie but i,this movie is so bad it is good
1,while i was n't really looking at all the characters the story the story and the acting was just plain awful,while the movie was a bit too dark and the characters seemed to be in a different mood it did n't seem
1,colombian cinema is one of those movies that is so much fun to watch,colombian film is a film that should be avoided by everyone who likes the original
1,if i could get my hands on this movie to be a good movie i would have to have a little more respect in the plot than to watch this film,if it was n't for the fact that it had to be a bit of a joke i could n't help but laugh at the lack of anything remotely redeeming
1,the movie is a complete mess and,the film is not a comedy
1,one of the most interesting things about this movie is that it is not a movie about a man 's life,one of the most beautiful scenes in the history of cinema is that it has a very touching story and is a
1,the movie is very well done but not enough to keep me watching,the film has a lot of action sequences but it 's just a bunch
1,this film was a complete disappointment,this is the best film that i
1,bad script poor direction and a bad script,bad movie bad acting bad script bad editing and
1,on the other hand it 's not as good as,on this one the actors do a great job
1,the movie was a bit too long for me,the film is very well done and is a must
1,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted but a little bit of,it 's the kind of thing that would have made the film worthwhile
1,this movie is a must see,this is a film that is not
1,the film is a very funny one,the film is not a comedy but it
1,absent to the director 's previous comment i have to say that the movie was a bit slow but i found it to be a bit of a disappointment and,absent from the first movie the director and director have been able to create a movie that is not only a visual masterpiece but also a very good one
1,i think the director was trying to make a good movie,i was n't sure if this was a bad movie or not
1,but the film is not as good as the original and it is not the best,but the real thing here is the fact that the story is a bit slow
1,stop the film from the good old fashioned and the bad guys,stop the movie from getting so bad that it is good
1,the acting is horrible the directing is poor the,the acting is horrible the script is awful
1,i was n't impressed with the story but the acting was,i think this was the first time i saw it
1,the acting in the film is so bad that i actually cringed at how much it sucked,the film has a very nice cast including robert montgomery and a young laurence fishburne as the main
1,he was a very good actor and a very good actor,he is a good man and he is a great actor
1,but this movie is a must see for everyone,but it 's not as bad as i thought it

1,macarthur is a great actor and he 's very funny,macarthur is a great actor but he has the ability to
1,the film is about a young boy who lives in a small town in london,the movie is a very good example of why a movie should be made
1,watching this movie is like watching the grass grow,watching this movie i was a little sceptical
1,and the movie has a lot of fun,and it is a shame that the film has
1,but the movie is n't bad,but this movie has the best of

1,the film is a bit slow but the film does have a few,the movie is a bit long and it 's not the same
1,a good cast of characters and a story about,a very funny movie with an allstar cast
1,men are the most popular things to happen in the,men and women are a little bit too young
1,i was expecting the same to be a lot of the,i was n't sure what was the point of it
1,i do n't think it is a good thing to watch this movie but i do n't think it 's the worst movie,i was n't expecting a lot from the story but i found it interesting that it was made in the first place
1,i do n't know if i should have had a headache,i have n't read the novel but i do n't think it
1,worth seeing if only for the music,worth seeing for all concerned with the film
1,both of those movies are the best,both of those actors are very good
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the film was a bit long and the story
1,this was a very good movie with,this is not one of them
1,because of the fact that it was made in the late 1990s and,because it is a movie that is n't afraid to be funny
1,lila and her husband have a very good relationship with the young girl who 's not afraid to get a job in the house,lila is a very attractive woman who has a very difficult time with her and her life is not as bad as the first

1,it is a very funny movie that,it 's not a good film
1,many people who have seen it know that they are not,many of the scenes in this film are very funny
1,but this is a film that will appeal to everyone who loves the genre,but i do n't have to say the same thing about this movie
1,it 's the story of a man who has been,it was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,why did n't he just kill her,why did they do this film
1,xica 's character was a bit too,xica is a very good film
1,like a lot of the film 's other films it 's a little slow and boring,like the first one it 's just a little too old and not that funny
1,especially the final battle between the two men,especially when you 're in a coma and you
1,the film 's story is about the lives of two friends who live in the same building as their parents,the acting was horrible the plot is bad and the plot is so predictable that it is impossible to believe that
1,malkovich is a great actor but the film is a bit slow and the ending feels like a contrived mess,malkovich is one of those movies that is a bit of a comedy and a bit too long and the film
1,but the movie is a bit slow at times and is,but i think the movie is a little too long
1,see it for the first time in the dark,see it if only for the sheer stupidity that it
1,although i have n't been a fan of the original series i was still able to find a new version of,although i do n't know how i could have seen this movie the movie would n't have been as good
1,aside from that it 's just a bad movie and i ca n't believe it was even,aside from the aforementioned plot twists and turns of the movie the plot is pretty weak
1,this is one of the most beautiful,this is a very good film
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,for the most part the movie is pretty much the same as the first,for a long time i was looking for a movie that was a good idea
1,first the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain stupid,first of all the plot is a little confusing and the story is
1,which is why the film was made in a very short and very early manner,which is what i thought was going to be a good idea to show up
1,after a while i was hooked and moved into tears by the movie,after the first hour i realized the movie was going to be about a
1,sadly the story is not very good,sadly it was n't the best of the
1,the film is a very good film,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,i have n't read any of these other comments about this movie and i have to say that,i do n't know how many times i 've seen a movie this one is so good
1,it 's a very good film,it was a great movie and it
1,in this case it 's a pretty decent movie with the usual plot twist and the characters are,in the meantime it 's a very good movie and i think that the actors are good
1,what i did n't like was the way it looked and looked very fake and,what a shame that i had n't seen the movie before i was born
1,to be honest i was not expecting the same kind of thing as it did in the,to be sure the movie was n't bad but the actors were n't as good either
1,the movie is not a bad film but it is not a bad movie,the movie is a bit too long but the movie is n't a complete waste
1,disney is the most popular film maker of this generation,disney 's the thing that was a big success
1,slowly he finds out that his son is the father of a woman who was killed by the devil,slowly it is revealed that the film is set in a remote town where it is set in new mexico
1,this is a very bad movie and it,this film was a waste of time
1,i do not recommend this movie to anyone,i have to admit i did enjoy watching the
1,it 's a shame that the film never got,it 's the only reason to watch it
1,to say that it 's a bad film is a mystery to,to me this movie is a complete waste of my time
1,things go wrong when the young man 's wife is murdered and killed by the devil,things are going downhill and we get the idea that the film is not a comedy
1,if you 're a fan of the original you should see this movie,if you 're a diehard fan of the original then you 'll probably like
1,but i was so disappointed that it was canceled,but the movie does a great job of capturing the
1,and i do agree that this was the worst movie,and the ending of the movie was so predictable
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad,i was surprised that the story was n't a bit predictable
1,yes it was a little too predictable but it is n't,yes the plot is simple enough but the movie is n't really
1,even the most ardent fans of these two have a very high tolerance for this film,even though the movie was a little bit of a bore i found the characters to be
1,the film is very slow moving,the acting is pretty good with some
1,but it 's not a good idea,but it does n't matter that the film
1,i do n't understand why the director decided to make a movie that,i do n't think i have seen this movie in the past
1,walter pidgeon plays a man who has no interest in his life but his wife and his friends are,walter matthau and john wayne are the perfect pair of characters and the film is very well made
1,it 's the story of a young,it 's just a bad film
1,but the real problem with this movie is,but this is a very bad movie
1,yes it is a great story but not the least,yes it 's a bit of a shame that the film
1,i was surprised to see this movie,i think the director was trying to make
1,i have seen this film countless times and it 's one of,i do n't think i 've ever heard of this movie
1,think about it and you have to watch,think of the movie as a whole
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but i was surprised,i'm a fan of the original series but i was disappointed
1,ditto to the actors and actresses who were in the movie,ditto for the fact that the movie was a little too slow
1,for the most part it was a little slow but i was surprised to see how it was made,for the record i would like to know that it was n't a good idea for a movie and the
1,ok the movie was n't so bad as the first but still a good one,ok so i was expecting a lot more from this film but i was expecting something
1,i was n't really expecting much from the movie,i do n't know why i did not like this
1,was it the same thing over and over again,was it the same thing as the original
1,for a while it was the first time i saw it and i still remember it fondly,for the first time in the series i had to stop watching the film for the first time
1,but this movie is so bad it 's funny,but the real problem is that it 's not the
1,the film is a little too slow for a horror movie but it 's a little bit too long and,the movie starts off with a bunch of guys trying to get their hands on a bunch of people
1,the film is very well done and the story is,the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,there is no reason why the film is so awful,there 's no real reason to see this movie but it
1,the film has a lot to do with the plot of the film,the film was a complete waste of my time and money i ca n't
1,the film was shot in a very grainy digital format but the acting,the acting was good but the script was n't very good either
1,for those of you who have n't seen it yet you will probably be disappointed,for the most part i found the film very entertaining and i liked this movie
1,no one is a good guy,no matter how hard you try to
1,it is a very funny movie,it is a very funny show
1,the acting in this film is very good,the film is about a young boy who is
1,but it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen,but the movie is a good mix of the two genres and
1,drew barrymore is a good choice for a role,drew barrymore and john cleese are the best actors in
1,at the same time the movie has a lot of action and some of the most memorable,at first it seems like a movie that is not funny but the acting is good
1,of course it 's not a great movie,of course there are some good things going on
1,the movie starts out with a group of friends who have to deal with,the movie is not a bad movie but the acting is pretty bad
1,paul lukas plays a man who gets involved with a group of people who are a bit of fun,paul muni is the perfect choice for his role in the movie and his performance as a character in a
1,of course the movie has a good deal of humor but it 's just not,of course it 's the only way to get the money to see it
1,if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this movie,if you want to make a movie about a group of people who are
1,a lot of the scenes are filmed in the background in the background,a lot of the scenes in the movie are very funny and funny to
1,jack frost is a movie about a,jack frost 2 is a classic
1,the acting is very good and the script is a good one,the acting was good the plot was pretty good and the acting was
1,i was expecting a movie about the evils of the human,i have n't laughed so hard since the last movie
1,when i saw it on tv i was surprised that it had been,when the movie was made i thought it was just a joke
1,she is the most convincing character in the movie and it 's hard to imagine why the director chose to make this film,she is a beautiful woman who is a woman who loves her husband and wants to be a father and a mother
1,awful acting bad script bad editing bad music bad editing,awful acting terrible direction bad editing and bad directing
1,i do n't know how this film was made,i have seen a lot of movies and have been
1,written directed by steven spielberg and starring edward g robinson this film is,written by a director who is n't afraid to make a movie
1,i do n't think that this movie was meant to be a comedy but,i was so disappointed that i did not get a copy of it
1,being the first to be a good film to see the first two films are the best of the two and the most notable one,being a fan of the original series i had to watch it to see what it was like to be a fan of the first movie
1,but the film is not as good,but the story is so weak that i
1,gary oldman is a good actor,gary cooper plays a very good actor
1,about the only thing that i did n't like was the fact that the movie was shot in black and white,about the only thing that kept me watching is the fact that the director and writer were trying to make the audience
1,i think this was a good movie,i was surprised by the ending
1,the acting is very good but the script is not bad,the film is about a man who is accused of his craft
1,but the film is a bit too,but it is a great movie
1,this is one of the most underrated films i have seen,this movie is so bad it makes me wonder how much it
1,dryly the film is a total mess of the first film,dryly the movie is about the same kind of people who are
1,the film is not a complete waste of time and,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,it is a very good film and it 's not even that great,it 's the story of two men who are in a different place in
1,there is a scene that is supposed to,there 's no plot to speak of
1,you can tell the director was trying to make a movie that is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch,you can tell the director was trying too hard to create a movie that was so bad that it was n't even funny
1,at least the actors were not very good,at the end of the movie the viewer is
1,the film was shot in a time where the film was shot,the film is a very interesting film and a great movie
1,rip torn is a film about a,rip offs from the first film
1,scorsese 's film is a very interesting film that,scorsese has made a film of this type
1,how can a film be made,how could they possibly get the money
1,possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen,possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever watched
1,what a shame that this is the best,what is this supposed to be about
1,i do n't know what to say,i was surprised by the amount of money
1,in a sense that the film is a little bit too long to,in the end the movie is a very good one to watch
1,he 's not a bad actor and he does n't really do anything,he is also a very nice guy but he 's a little too old
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a bit,it 's the kind of movie you should watch
1,some of the other actors are good but,some of them are just plain awful
1,after all these years the film is about a group of young men who are trying to survive in a remote town in the mountains,after the death of his wife he is forced to leave the family and his son who is in a wheelchair with his mother
1,the film is a little over an hour and half and the story is a bit too thin,the acting was good the directing and directing was great the direction was excellent and the writing was great
1,definitely a film for fans of the classic genre of horror films like,definitely the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life
1,to be fair i do n't know why,to me it 's a good movie to watch
1,then i realized i was watching a film that,then the movie starts out with a bang
1,more than just an hour long it is still,more importantly the movie has some good acting
1,music is a very good one and i think that 's what the story was all about,music score is a bit choppy but the music is also very good and the film is quite
1,maybe he should be able to make a movie with a little girl,maybe it 's a good idea that it 's not a comedy
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie,i think that it is one of those movies that you
1,the movie has a lot to say and,the acting in this is pretty bad
1,not only was the acting terrible but the story and the acting was so good,not only does it not have to be the worst movie i 've seen this year
1,my only problem with this is that the plot is n't even remotely interesting,my only criticism is that the film has a very long list of characters and
1,in this case he is a very talented and charismatic director who has a very difficult time producing a story,in a nutshell the movie is about two men who are married and are married in the same country
1,just as the film is so boring it 's not even that good,just do n't expect a lot of it and the ending is a bit
1,it 's a pity that the movie,it is a very good film
1,for those who have n't yet seen the film and have read the novel the book should be seen by anyone,for those who like to see the first two movies i would like to see the sequel to the first film and
1,perhaps this is the best film of the decade,perhaps it was the script and the acting
1,lake mungo was a great show and the first episode was very enjoyable,lake mungo and the texas chainsaw massacre are a lot better and i think
1,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the history of,this is a movie that i would advise anyone to watch it
1,been the first movie to have an audience member in the audience,been a fan of the original i had to be surprised at the
1,they are not even close to the truth,they were n't even nominated for a film
1,anne heche plays the role of a woman,anne hathaway was a very good actress
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film was a complete waste of
1,featuring some of the most ridiculous and ridiculous scenes of all time and a half hour long long drawn out,featuring an interesting cast and the supporting cast it was a great surprise to see it in the theater
1,that is a shame because this is a very very,that is the best part of the whole movie
1,in fact the only good thing about this movie is the music,in the first part of the movie we see the young boy being
1,the film is about a man who,the film is not a comedy
1,i was expecting a lot of this movie,i have to wonder why they made such a
1,indeed this is a very good film,indeed it is a very bad movie
1,honestly this is not a movie that is n't,honestly the movie is not a bad movie
1,it 's just a shame that the director and his crew,it 's not a great film but a great one
1,we have the movie in a way that is n't a bad one but it is not,we get the feeling that the characters were real people who were supposed as they were
1,rani mukherjee is the only good thing about this film,rani mukherjee was a great actress in the film
1,in fact this is one of the best movies ever made and it has to be said that the film was very good,in fact the film is not only about the plight of two men and the relationship between the two men but the relationship between
1,if i had to give this a zero out of 10 i would,if you 're looking for something that 's not bad it 's not a
1,pros are not the best actors in the world,pros of the story is not a good one
1,it 's a shame that the director did n't get the chance,it was a very good movie and the acting was excellent
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt,and i do n't want to talk about
1,but it 's a shame because i have seen the original,but the story is not so much a character study
1,the film is very slow and boring,the acting is good and the story is
1,leeds 's character is a little more complex,leeds was the only character in this film that
1,this is a film that is not just,this movie has a very bad story
1,also i thought it was a great movie,also the film is not as bad as the
1,in this film he plays a character who is a bit of an antihero,in the end he does the best he can but he is n't
1,welcome to the movie 's title,welcome to a few other films like
1,for those of you who have seen this movie you have a great idea of what the movie is about,for those who have not read the book i think this movie was very well written by a very talented cast
1,the film has a very good story and the actors are,the movie is very funny but not a bad thing
1,both films are a lot better,both the film 's detractors and the
1,daniel craig is the only actor in this that is able to play a role in his,daniel daylewis as the villain who was a great actor was a real treat to watch
1,i was expecting a good movie and i did,i do n't know if this was the best movie
1,i have seen this movie many times and have seen it countless times,i do n't know how to make a movie that i can watch
1,this movie is so bad i ca n't even begin to describe how awful this film truly,this film is a must see for anyone interested in a film that is very good
1,now i know i have seen the original movie and i have n't heard of it,now i know i 've seen the original but i ca n't remember the last time i
1,the movie is a complete bore,the film is a little slow paced
1,before the film is over you will find yourself asking yourself what is,before i wrap my head off i was surprised by the movie
1,for the first hour or so of the film i thought it was,for the rest of my life it 's a pretty good film
1,aside from a few moments of humor it is a,aside from that it 's a very good movie
1,the film is a little slow but it,the film is a little slow paced
1,after seeing the movie i thought it was pretty good and i did n't get to know the characters,after the death of his mother the father and son of a young man named lila is a little too
1,the acting was terrible the plot was awful and the plot was just a waste of time,the acting was n't bad but the story line is so awful it 's hard for me to
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's not a bad film,it 's a pity that the movie is not so bad as to be
1,while this movie is n't a bad movie it was a very good one,while i do n't like it i can honestly say that the film is a
1,diplomacy is the best of the bunch,diplomacy is a very very good film that
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie and it is not a movie to be taken seriously,the film has a very good cast including a young man who is also a compulsive gambler who is a man who has
1,i was surprised by the amount of money spent on this film,i was expecting something more of a film but i was n't sure
1,i have seen this movie many times and it is very funny,i do n't understand why the people who made this film were not
1,awesome movie and i would n't have been so disappointed by the ending,awesome film with an excellent cast a great story and a great cast
1,dopes and dolls are not always the same,dopes are always the same people in the same
1,i have n't seen it since it was released,i have seen this movie several times and have watched
1,this is the first movie i 've seen that,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,the acting is pretty good but the script is n't really bad and the actors are just bad,the film is about a man named benjamin who is in love with his mother but he 's a
1,i was surprised to find that the film is not as good as the first one and it is n't even that good,i have never seen such bad acting and yet again i ca n't wait for the next sylvester apatow to die and the movie
1,it 's a great film for those who,it 's not even worth a look
1,there are some very nice moments and the story is very well told,there are some good scenes of the movie and the movie is not very
1,this movie is so bad it 's funny,this film is so bad i ca n't even
1,some people have said that the movie is about the life of a man who has a heart attack and the consequences he makes,some of the scenes in the movie are so bad that you feel like you are watching the movie with a little more of a
1,that said it is a very good movie,that 's the only reason i can think of
1,examples include the fact that it 's not a bad movie and is a waste of time to watch,examples of the film are that they are not the ones who are in the movie and the film does
1,btw the movie is n't really about a,btw this film is not for everyone
1,spoilers i was n't surprised to find that the film,spoilers ahead the film is a very good one
1,just a little more than the sum of the parts of the story,just as the film is set in the middle of a crowded desert desert
1,this was one of my first time viewing,this was a great film for me and i
1,stewart and his wife are a bit too old to be taken away from a very difficult situation,stewart is a great actor but his character is a bit weak and he does n't seem very convincing
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the film is a little bit of a mess
1,disney is the best of this generation,disney is a great director and this is
1,needless to say that the acting is bad the plot is bad the acting is bad the plot is awful the script is,needless to say it is a movie about a man who 's been born in a mental hospital in a foreign country
1,despite the fact that this film is set against the backdrop of a new york city it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie,despite being a fan of the original film i have to say it was a great idea for a movie but i think this is
1,this film is one of the most boring,this is one of my favorite movies
1,i do n't want to spoil it for you but you have to see it to believe,i have n't seen the original version but i do have a problem with this movie
1,it 's the story of an older man who is in the business and,it is a shame that the movie has not got a cult following
1,okay so the movie is a little slow and the ending is,okay so i do n't think this is a good film
1,save your money and rent the dvd,save your own money and rent this movie
1,and it 's not even the best,and the film has a great cast
1,her character is a caricature of the story and her character is the one who has to deal,her character is so unlikable that she is n't believable and she is n't even remotely funny
1,i was n't sure whether i should have been in a coma or not but it would have been better to see,i was so impressed by the story and the characters that you feel the need to know what is going on
1,donald pleasance 's portrayal of the film 's protagonist is a little too,donald pleasence is the perfect choice for this role as the villain
1,a lot of people have complained that this is the worst movie i have ever seen,a few of the scenes are just too long and too little to be funny
1,also the ending is very predictable and i do n't think that the ending,also the movie is very good and the actors are all very good
1,add a little extra nudity and nudity to make the audience enjoy the movie and it will make your head hurt,add to that a great cast a great cast a great script and a good script that is so funny that you
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so,it was a waste of time and money
1,this is one of the best movies i 've,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,the movie has a lot of action and a lot of action,the acting and direction are so bad that i could n't help but
1,after the first half of the film the viewer gets to know,after all this movie is not about the evils of war
1,the story is a bit of a mess but it 's,the acting is good and the story is very good
1,they are all the more powerful and more interesting than the characters,they have a lot to do with this movie and i do n't
1,for a movie that has been made to make you feel like you are watching a movie,for a movie about a woman who has been abused by her husband and her family and the
1,ditto to the actors who are not a good actor,ditto for the fact that it is a very good film
1,juon 2 is a very good movie but i think it is,juon is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,instead of the usual clichs we get to see the characters and characters in this movie,instead of having a child and the girl in the movie we are supposed to root for
1,their relationship with a married man who has been in the past for years is not a good idea for the role,their characters are so real and so real and so real and the story lines that you can relate to them
1,such a shame that it was not a success of the,such a film as the other side of the tracks
1,pretty soon the movie is a little over the top but it 's a,pretty soon the film is about a man named benjamin and his wife
1,this is the first movie that i 've ever seen in which the actors are so good,this is one that i have seen in years and it 's a very good film to watch
1,not only is this movie a complete waste of time it does n't even have any,not only is the story a little weak but the characters are likable and likable
1,now i have seen a lot of movies and i have n't seen this one,now i am a fan of the series but i do n't have any complaints about
1,not to mention that the acting is horrible,not only is this a very good show it
1,the acting is good with all the actors and actresses,the story is very simple and is very interesting and the
1,also the film is a bit slow,also the movie is a bit too long
1,the film is a complete waste of time and,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,risque acting and the plot is not really a bad one,risque and not funny it was n't even funny and i was
1,i have n't seen the original but,i was expecting something like this
1,my friend and i were laughing at the tv,my advice is do n't miss the opportunity to see
1,was it a dream movie with a few twists,was he really the best man in this movie
1,i do n't think that a good film could be done in,i was surprised that this film had n't been released theatrically
1,showing a little girl who 's been married to the,showing the world of the world and its consequences
1,same goes for the rest of the cast,same for the rest of the movie
1,as a matter i would n't have been surprised that this was a movie,as i watched the film i felt like i was watching a documentary
1,i do n't think this is a movie that is so,i do n't know what to say about this film
1,still i do n't know what this,still the story was very good
1,the acting is pretty good with a very good performance by the lead actress who is also the only one,the story is simple and the characters are so well done that it is hard to care for them
1,s epatha merkerson is a very good actress and is also very good in the role of her mother,s h macy 's character was a bit of a caricature but the film is a bit too long to
1,the movie has a lot of potential to do with the story,the movie is not as good as some of the other movies but
1,i was expecting a good movie but i was,i was n't really sure what to expect
1,i do n't want to spoil the ending but i 'll say it was one of the best films,i have n't seen the movie yet and i have to say it was a very enjoyable film
1,most of the actors are very good but the script is so weak that i could,most of it is the same as a child and it 's not that great
1,yes the film is not about the evils of a family and the people involved in,yes the movie is n't a bad film and the acting is n't bad either
1,every time i watch the whole thing i was reminded of,every single character has a personality and is so believable
1,the acting was horrible and the script was just plain awful,the acting is pretty good but the script is awful
1,really bad film and not for the faint hearted but i recommend it,really this film is n't a complete waste of time but a very good
1,this was one of the best films ever,this movie has a lot of potential
1,it 's a shame to see a,it was n't a good movie
1,plus the acting is so awful that you ca n't help,plus the movie is not so bad it 's good
1,this is one of those movies where you do n't have to have,this film is a great example of how to make a movie
1,ms and his men are the best of the bunch,ms and the men are the same as the ones who
1,this movie is so much better,this movie is a must have for
1,that said it is a very good film,that is the only positive thing about this movie
1,all the actors are good but they are all wasted,all i can say is that it was a waste of
1,i was expecting a good movie but it was not,i have to admit that i was n't expecting much
1,i think the movie was made by a competent director and it 's,i think it was one of the best films of the year
1,it 's a shame that such a bad movie is n't made,it 's a shame because the movie is a little slow
1,some of the scenes are just plain awful,some of the other reviewers have said that this
1,even if you 're in the right mood for a film that is not a complete disaster it 's not worth your time,even if it 's not for the fact that it is not the best film ever made and the fact that i was watching
1,jerome palminteri is the perfect actor to play a role,jerome palminteri is the best actor in this film
1,ethel barrymore is a delight as the woman who is in her own,ethel barrymore is a wonderful actress but she is n't a great actress
1,she is not a good actor,she 's not the only person who
1,so i guess i 'll be a little disappointed,so the film has a lot of good moments and
1,the acting and direction are excellent,the film is not as good as
1,the story is about a young man who is sent to prison to,the film is very slow paced and the acting is very bad
1,we have seen a couple of movies that are made in the,we are left with this film and we are not alone
1,furthermore the film is a little too long,furthermore the film is a bit long
1,with the exception of the two leads in the film the film has an odd plot,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is a movie that i recommend watching
1,instead of a good laugh or a joke,instead it is a very good film
1,thus i was expecting a movie that was n't,thus the movie has a few funny moments
1,sadly the story is not a very interesting idea,sadly this was the first film in the series that
1,apparently there was no way to go to a movie with the actors and the director,apparently this movie has a few funny moments and it has a lot of laughs
1,in fact it 's just not funny,in the end the film is just a

1,but the film is a bit slow at times and,but i do n't know what the point is
1,as the film opens we get to see him in a different way,as the story develops you have to wonder how many people who have commented

1,i was n't expecting much from this,i was expecting a lot from this movie
1,moore is not only an actor but a good man,moore 's performance as the lead character in this movie is
1,here 's a movie that you can watch with,here he is the embodiment of the group
1,while i do n't know how i could get a copy of it i would n't have,while the film is a bit of an action movie it is a bit too long
1,the film has a lot of potential but the film 's direction was very slow and,the acting is good the script is a bit slow and the acting is bad
1,there are some good moments and the acting is good,there are some good moments in this movie but the story
1,they were n't even close to the original,they 're just so bad they are just so
1,but it is n't the worst movie i 've ever watched,but the film is not so much a comedy as a satire
1,and that 's why i think that the movie is a,and it was the most expensive of the three films
1,at least i think it was the first movie to make me laugh,at one point i was a bit puzzled that i had n't seen the

1,i do n't think it was a great idea to make,i do n't think that the movie is worth watching
1,i do n't think it 's that bad,i do not know what it was like to
1,it 's not even the same old,it was a very funny movie
1,in a way this movie is n't a complete waste of my time,in fact the film is a little too long and is not a very
1,i was surprised that the film was made,i have n't seen the original series yet
1,max steiner is the perfect choice for the role,max steiner is a great director who has made a
1,for those of you who have n't seen it yet you 'll probably be a little disappointed,for the first time in a long long time we were able to see the movie as the
1,despite the title this movie has no redeeming qualities,despite the fact that he has the talent to be
1,sir humphrey bogart is one of my favorites as a singer,sir john gielgud has a good sense of humour and he is

1,this is one of my favorite movies of all time,this was the first film i 've seen in quite some
1,the movie is not as bad as,the movie is a complete mess
1,this movie has a great cast and a very good story,this movie has a lot of problems with the movie
1,it was a very funny movie but the story is so weak that you ca n't,it is n't a film to be taken seriously but it 's a great movie
1,it 's not a great film but it is still a very good movie,it is a shame that the filmmakers decided that this is a good idea to
1,the acting in this film is excellent,the movie is a bit too long
1,i have seen this movie twice and still ca n't wait to watch it again,i have to say i was very pleased with the acting and the plot
1,elizabeth taylor is the only reason why i give this movie a 2 instead of a 0,elizabeth shue is a very attractive and talented actress and she 's not only the best actress but
1,she 's a very good actress,she is a great actress but she
1,but it is n't that much more than,but the film is a complete failure
1,ritter and his wife are all very funny,ritter 's character is a little bit too old
1,if you have a craving for this film you should see it,if i had a choice for the movie i would n't have to
1,in the end the movie is just a,in this case i was very disappointed
1,tim robbins plays a man who is sent to prison to investigate a mysterious incident,tim curry plays a man who is a man and is not afraid to be in
1,when i saw a preview screening of the film,when the film finally ended i was hooked
1,i do n't think i can remember that,i do n't think that a movie should be
1,on the other hand it 's a great film that is worth seeing for any,on the way home is a very good and very very very good movie
1,that 's the only thing that made this movie so bad,that 's a shame because the movie is a total mess
1,anyone who has seen it knows that the film is not a comedy and a serious one and the only other one i 've ever seen,anyone who has seen a movie about the holocaust or the other side of the tracks will notice this film is not a complete success
1,dean stockwell is excellent in the role of his wife,dean stockwell is a great actor and i do n't know
1,if you are not a fan of the genre this is a film to watch,if you 're looking for a movie with an interesting story line this is the one
1,only the most hardened and interesting character of the film is the girl who is,only one thing is the fact that he was n't a hero at all
1,once the movie begins it becomes a joke,once again the movie is about a bunch of
1,a very good film with great acting by all involved,a very interesting movie about a man who is in love
1,he was a little more than a year later,he is a good guy and he 's a great
1,i do n't think i have seen the original movie,i have n't read the book so i can understand the
1,although the plot is n't as bad as the original the acting is pretty good,although i do n't know what to say about the movie it 's just plain boring
1,and the movie is a bit of a mess,and that was the reason for this film
1,i was n't expecting a good movie to be honest but i was n't expecting much from,i think the movie was a bit too long and it was a bit too long
1,the film is a complete bore and i do n't know why i watched this movie,the film is about a young man who has his own problems and is a man who
1,nancy michelle gellar is a good choice for this film,nancy drew and her husband were all in attendance
1,so i was n't expecting anything else,so i have to say i did n't
1,one of the most interesting things about this film is,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,and the film is a little too much to be judged,and the movie is not a total waste of time
1,the movie is a bit of an action thriller,the movie was a bit of the same
1,then there is that scene in which the two men go to the woods,then there 's the fact that the film has a very good cast
1,now that 's not the point,now that 's what makes it so
1,we are shown a lot of the movie,we have a movie that is n't a good
1,if you 're a big fan of the original you 'll like this,if you are looking for something that is n't bad enough to get you
1,oh yes and the film is a bit slow,oh and it is the worst movie i have ever
1,shortly afterwards he is a young man who 's been diagnosed with the life of his,shortly after the movie 's release it is a very good movie to be seen
1,we have a lot of people who have n't seen the,we are left with a feeling of what is happening
1,he 's not the only one to do this and that is the only way,he has the ability to be a hero and he has a good life
1,that 's what makes it so good,that 's what i got when i saw
1,even the actors were not very good,even if you are looking for something more
1,obviously he has a lot more to do than the usual suspects of the town and the way he,obviously the film is a bit of a mess but it is not as good as the first
1,like the other reviewer said it was n't a great,like the first film the acting was pretty good
1,strangler is the best of all the blackadder movies,strangler is a movie that should have been released on
1,well i do n't think that this is a movie that is a waste of your,well the story is a little too thin and the plot is n't that interesting
1,director robert de niro was a genius,director john carpenter is also a master in
1,for those of you that do n't have a taste for this movie i would say that the movie is a bit of a mess,for those who have n't read the book and have read the book and have read the book the book is based on the novel by

1,angry and confused is a movie that you will enjoy watching it in a,angry and unhappy are two men who have been killed by their parents
1,the film has a very strong plot but is n't a movie,the film has a lot of action and the acting is superb
1,for a movie made in the late seventies this is a must see for all fans of the genre,for me it 's just a shame that the director did n't have the budget to make a movie that
1,i'm not a fan of the book but i was n't disappointed,i'm not a big fan of the genre but i have to admit
1,in fact the whole cast is very good,in fact the film is so poorly written and
1,wish i had n't seen the original,wish they 'd made the movie
1,also i do n't think it is that a movie like this should be made in a hurry,also the film has some nice scenes and a good cast but it is a very enjoyable movie
1,really bad film about a bunch of people,really this is a movie that is not only
1,they are all in a very good place,they 're the best of the two
1,well this movie has a lot of potential,well it 's not as funny as some other
1,and it 's a good thing to see the film as it 's a good thing that i do n't know about,and i think the reason i did n't give it a chance is because the plot and characters are so bad
1,while i do n't think that the movie is good it,while i was watching a film i was n't disappointed
1,it 's a very good movie and a great film for those who enjoy the,it 's a great show and it is one of the best shows ever
1,the movie is a bit of a mess and,the film was shot in black and white

1,you have a great time watching this one,you can get a lot of money for a
1,this was a great movie to watch,this movie is not for everyone
1,most of the movie is about the characters and their interactions,most of the film 's plot twists and turns and twists were
1,although the movie is a bit long i think that the film was shot entirely in the style,although the film is a bit slow the plot is very thin and the characters are underdeveloped
1,how did they manage to make such a bad film,how could it be possible to have a film with such
1,perhaps the director was n't going to be the only person to do a remake of the film,perhaps the most memorable scene in the entire movie was the scene where the hero was trying to kill
1,overall this is an excellent film,overall this is a good film
1,even though it was a bit long and the story was not a complete,even though it was a long time ago i still found it interesting
1,i was expecting something more than i could chew,i was expecting something like this and i could not
1,i'm a huge fan of this movie so i do n't really care what happens next,i'm sure it 's the best of the series and the best part of the film is
1,the film is a complete mess of a film with the exception of the director 's name,the film has a lot of action sequences and the plot is very good and the characters are
1,this movie is one of those movies,this film is a great movie
1,frankly i do n't know what to think of this film,frankly i think this film is a waste of money
1,but it is n't a good thing that,but the movie is a complete mess

1,i was n't expecting a good movie,i have n't read the novel but i
1,if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll find this one,if it was n't for the good acting and the directing and the direction
1,although the film was made for the first forty minutes or so it was just a waste of time,although i do not understand the plot i do n't care what happened to the characters in the movie
1,riding a truck in a small highrise town,riding lessons and a few other characters are the
1,the acting is pretty good but it is n't a good thing,the movie is about the same thing about the life of an artist

1,there are some good scenes but it is n't that great,there 's a scene in which a young woman is stabbed and
1,this movie is a waste of time,this is a very bad movie with a
1,within the first five minutes i was wondering if the writer was trying to be clever or funny or something,within the first 15 minutes of the film the film is set in a very interesting and interesting way and then
1,the film is very well made and the acting is superb,the movie starts off well enough but it does n't
1,you can tell it was a low budget film that was n't even nominated for best screenplay,you know the drill is n't going to be as scary and the killer is a bit more
1,as for the rest of the movie the acting and direction are very good,as the movie opens you know that this is not a bad movie
1,the film is not a documentary about a man who has a heart attack,the story of the movie is about a young girl who has been abused by

1,this is a very bad show,this is not a good movie
1,but the film 's plot is n't too good,but i think that the movie was a bit too
1,and the movie is so bad,and i do n't think that 's
1,it was a very good movie,it 's a very simple story of
1,the film was shot in the same year as the first movie but i was n't sure what the real thing was,the film has a very strong plot and is a good example of why a film like this can be released
1,the film has a great cast including a great,the movie is a little over the top
1,the film is about a group of people who have a very strange,the acting was horrible the plot was bad the script was awful

1,all of these actors are very good,all in all a great movie
1,this movie is a must see movie,this is not the best film i 've
1,when you 're in a movie about this movie it 's a very,when the movie was released the film was released in the us
1,merging a couple of scenes together with a few exceptions and a good ending that makes you want to see more of the characters,merging a story with a story that is a good one to follow the story of a man who is not alone in the world
1,my favorite character was the one with a lot,my friend and i rented it on dvd
1,the story is about the same people who are married to a young girl,the film has a very good cast and the supporting cast is excellent
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the film is a bit too slow
1,after a while i was a little confused,after the movie i was very disappointed
1,but the movie is n't that good,but the real problem here is that the
1,secondly this is a film of a certain type,secondly i was not disappointed in the film
1,obsessed with the same problems with a woman he is a little more interesting than the other,obsessed with the death of his mother she is forced to confront her own problems with her and

1,still it is not a movie,still the movie is n't a good
1,you can see this movie in a very different way than in the other films,you can get the idea of the film and it 's not the same

1,when he is asked by a friend to take him back to his family they,when i saw this film i thought it was going to be another one
1,over the course of the movie there is the fact that the movie is a comedy,over the years i have a theory of a movie and i have to admit that i
1,a few years ago i was a bit reluctant to have seen the movie,a few minutes of the movie are shot and shot in the head with the
1,the film 's main drawback is its lack of originality,the acting is good the story is very good
1,now i have seen it in a few years,now that 's a good thing to be done with
1,ninety minutes into the movie i was just hoping it would be another,ninety minutes of this movie are the only ones i have seen
1,hollywood 's film is not a good one but i think it was the first one that made me think of a good film,hollywood 's the film is a classic and the best thing about it is that it is a movie about an aging family

1,it 's not the worst movie that i 've seen in my,it 's a shame because it is not a bad movie
1,why do they do that in the,why is n't he a murderer
1,and that 's what i got from the movie,and it is not the best movie i have ever
1,if you are looking for a good movie with some good actors and a good plot line then you should definitely check this one out,if you 're a fan of the original series and have read the book you will find yourself asking yourself what the heck was going on
1,catchphrases like this are not funny and not that good,catchphrases are n't as bad as some other films have but
1,at the beginning of the film we see a young,at least the film is n't a total failure
1,seldom have i seen so many of my favorite actors,seldom have i been so disgusted by the film and the
1,dominic monaghan plays a man who is trying to get his money back,dominic chianese is a good actor and he is good in it
1,coming from the us the film was made by the bbc,coming from the director 's chair and the director and the director
1,all i can say was that this movie was a waste of time and i,all in all this is a great movie that is a joy to watch
1,just like the first film i have to say this is one of my favorite movies,just as the film was shot and the lighting of this movie is the same as the
1,like a lot of movies i 've always liked and i have seen it twice,like a lot of movies that i have ever seen i was very impressed

1,the film is very well made,the movie is a very interesting one

1,virginia mayo is a fine actor and she 's very,virginia madsen is a delight as the young lady
1,he 's a little too young and he is too old,he is a good actor but he is not a bad actor
1,those of us who do n't know about the movie and,those who have not seen it will probably enjoy it
1,these guys were n't the best actors in the movie but they were n't good,these guys are just so stupid that i do n't know where to begin
1,their characters are so real and so believable that i was able to predict,their performances are not as great as they are in the original movie
1,owen and the gang of friends and their families are the only ones who are able to find the truth,owen wilson is a great director and a great actor but he does n't have much to work with

1,this is one of the best movies of all time,this movie is a must see for anyone who likes to
1,i was surprised that the movie had a lot going for it,i do n't want to give away much of the plot
1,another thing is that the film does n't have a lot of action and the ending is pretty,another thing that i did like is that the film was made in a very cheap manner
1,instead of a good story it just does n't work,instead of the usual clich we get a bunch of characters
1,it 's not even a movie,it was the first time that i
1,at least that 's what it is,at least the film was made by the
1,the film is about a woman who lives,the film 's premise is the same
1,in this case the movie is a complete mess,in the end it was just another movie
1,and the ending was so predictable and predictable,and the ending is a little abrupt
1,i have seen the film several times,i was surprised to learn that the movie

1,the acting was n't bad either,the acting is very good and the
1,after all the movie is a bit too,after all it 's a great movie

1,so the film was a complete mess,so i was n't impressed at all that
1,but it is not the most important,but i have seen the film and i
1,colossus has been a great film since,colossus was a very good movie
1,if you are into the genre of the genre you might,if you have n't seen it yet do n't bother
1,a very interesting story and a good story,a few years later she is married to her
1,it was a great film and it,it was n't even that funny
1,we are not sure whether it is the fact that the characters are so bad they just are n't funny,we have to be a bit more careful to understand that the director 's decision to make it work is a
1,i have seen it three times and i can still,i think the film is a bit too slow
1,near the end i found myself wishing i had n't been able to see it again,near the end of the movie we are left to wonder if the director intended to make
1,i do n't think that the movie was meant to,i do not know how this film got made
1,albums are the only reason why this movie is so bad it,albums and the music is excellent and the music is wonderful
1,so i do not know how to make a movie,so the film is a bit slow but the acting is
1,and the acting is pretty bad the story is very weak and the characters are just plain boring,and i have to admit that i have n't seen it in the past 15 years and it was
1,the film was a complete waste of time and,the film 's plot was n't that bad
1,this movie has a lot more to say and it is not a bad movie,this movie was so bad it was good and i was so disappointed i decided to
1,not to mention the acting is horrible,not to mention it was made in the
1,i do n't know what the point of this is,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but it
1,this film is so bad it makes,this movie has been a staple
1,although i was not impressed by the film i did n't like it,although i do n't have a problem with the fact that i have n't
1,thus the film is a little too long and it has no story,thus it is a film that has no real meaning to the story and
1,he 's not the most interesting character,he was a very good actor
1,joao and the girl is a pretty,joao is a very talented character
1,chevy chase plays the role of the father of a man who is a,chevy chase is a fine actor and he 's not a bad actor
1,lastly the film is a bit of a mess,lastly the story is a bit weak but there are
1,while i was watching the movie i was n't expecting much from it but i was pleasantly surprised at how bad it was,while it 's true that the film was made by the same director as the original it 's still a good film
1,my advice is that if you 're a big fan of the series you,my friend and i rented the dvd of it and i loved it
1,this film is a must see for any horror fan and for fans of the horror genre,this movie is so bad that it is hard to believe that this is a film that has
1,my only complaint is that it was n't a comedy,my advice is to avoid this one at any cost
1,too bad it 's not even worth renting for the,too bad that the film was n't even released
1,this is the kind of film you would watch if it were in the theaters and the movie is a bit over,this movie is so bad that it is hard to believe that it 's actually made by a group of people
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money,the film is very well made and is a great movie
1,the acting was good but i was n't impressed by the story and acting,the film is about the power of the characters the characters the plot and the
1,almost all the other reviewers have mentioned the fact that it has,almost all of the actors in the movie were very talented
1,this was a good movie and i liked it,this film is a must see for anyone who wants
1,yeah i know the film was n't going to be a sequel but the movie is a complete mess,yeah it 's a bit of a shame that the movie has a little bit of a plot but the
1,in the end it is the worst movie i have,in the end the film has no redeeming qualities
1,seldom do you know that the real murderer is a real person,seldom do we get to see the characters in the film
1,for those who have n't seen this movie i would say it was a waste of time,for those who have n't seen this film you have a very difficult time to watch
1,who is that the real murderer,who is that the only person who
1,he is not the only one to be able to get a good deal of time,he is not a good person but he does n't seem to be a hero
1,as the movie opens we learn that the film is,as the movie opens the story becomes increasingly convoluted
1,following the plot of the film is a little bit too long and it is n't as good as the first movie,following a series of murders and a couple of the most gruesome murders i had seen in the last few decades i had
1,although it was not a great movie it was very well done,although the film is not as much a masterpiece as in the original
1,sam neill is a great actor,sam raimi 's film is a masterpiece
1,the film was a little slow at times but i found myself,the acting is good but the story is not very interesting
1,and it was the most expensive movie i,and it 's not that i do
1,mehmet ali khan is excellent as the villain,mehmet ali khan was great in his role as
1,they 're just so stupid and so lame that you can barely tell what 's going on and the,they are not funny and they 're all pretty funny and the movie is n't even worth mentioning
1,from the opening sequence the viewer is left wondering what the hell is going on with it,from the very start of the story i was really looking forward to watching this movie
1,soon after a few minutes the film is about as much of a joke as the rest of the film,soon after the first time i saw this movie i had to watch the first movie and i did n't even
1,save your money and watch a film that is n't even worth renting or buying,save your money rent the dvd and watch it with a friend of mine
1,the film is a bit too long and it,the acting is horrible the plot is bad
1,i have seen this film several times in its entirety as a very good film,i do not think that this is one of the most beautiful films of the last
1,i have seen the movie multiple times,i was expecting a good story and a
1,they are all very good actors and actresses and the,they have a lot of fun to work with
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the film is about a young woman who is
1,against the backdrop of this film i have no idea how this is going to be a movie and a movie about a man,against the backdrop of the movie there are a few things that make it hard to find a movie which is not a good movie
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was pleasantly surprised,i have seen this movie several times and it still has me hooked in
1,to make this a horror movie is a mystery that is,to me the film has a lot to recommend it
1,and i think that the director 's cut was the best,and the ending was a bit abrupt and i do n't know
1,i do n't think that it was the intention of the movie,i was surprised to learn that this is a good movie
1,it 's a shame because it has no redeeming qualities,it 's not a great movie but it 's still a
1,this is the first movie i 've ever seen that has been done by,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the subject matter
1,it 's a very funny and funny movie that is not just about the people who live there and it is the most powerful movie of all time,it is the story of a man who is trying to get his wife to a life in a world where he is a little too old for his
1,it has a very good cast and a,it 's a great movie to watch
1,i was expecting this movie to be a great movie,i was n't expecting anything from the movie but this movie
1,the acting was terrible and i was bored,the film is about a man who is a
1,but it was not a good film and i would n't be surprised to find a movie to be,but it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't have to be so much more than that
1,after a while the movie becomes a big hit,after a while i was n't able to see any
1,just as you would think a film with the title card would n't be,just as you know the movie is n't going to be a success
1,great performances by all involved and a,great acting and a great script
1,it is a great movie and it is not a movie,it 's not the worst film i 've ever seen
1,this is the best film i have ever seen,this is a very good movie and it 's a
1,if you 're a fan of the original you 'll find the story a bit,if i had to watch this film i would have had a better life
1,if you have n't seen the original you 'll find this film very entertaining,if you are a fan of the original you 'll probably love it
1,although the film is a little slow it is a bit slow at times,although it is a very poor movie and the script and script are so bad
1,that is what this movie is,that 's why i love this movie
1,even the music was a little too loud,even the acting is terrible the story is awful
1,i was surprised to see how this film,i have n't seen the original version
1,the movie was a complete failure to watch and i do n't even think that it,the film is very slow paced and the characters in the movie are very unlikable
1,the acting was n't too bad either,the movie is a bit long and it
1,the film is a bit of a mess and it does not have the impact of a great film but it,the film 's premise is to be commended for the lack of a decent script and the director 's direction
1,even the music is n't very good,even the music is n't very good
1,never mind the fact that the movie,never have you been so disgusted
1,martin landau and his wife are the best in the movie,martin landau and james cagney have been in this film for over
1,on the other hand i think this was the worst movie i have ever seen,on the other hand the movie is a bit of a bore and it is a
1,it 's a shame that this film is not only a,it was n't a good film but it was good
1,garfield 's character is a bit dim,garfield is a very good actor and is
1,do n't be fooled by this movie,do n't worry about this one
1,from there the story is about as simple as it gets,from the opening scene of the film the film is a little
1,what is the point of the story that is so predictable,what a shame this film was not nominated for a academy award
1,by far the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen it all,by the way the film 's biggest problem is the lack of a coherent script
1,welcome to the movie 's title is,welcome to the film 's plot
1,despite this film being a good movie it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen,despite the fact that the film was filmed in a very limited budget it was still a very
1,there 's no real reason to watch it,there 's a lot of action in it
1,the acting is good and the script is good but not as bad as i expected,the acting is good but the plot line is n't as good as the first one
1,it is a movie that is not only about the war and how,it 's not a great movie but it 's a good movie
1,he is a great actor and is a great actor,he was a very good actor and i was surprised that
1,looking at the cast and the script,looking for a better movie than this one
1,kenneth branagh is the only good thing in this film,kenneth branagh 's character was the best one of the three
1,sue has been married with the woman for years and her husband is still a little too reluctant to get,sue is a great actor and a great movie for those of you who have never seen the film
1,though the movie has a bit of a good story it is not a good one,though it was not as bad as it was in the original it was still pretty good
1,this movie was a great idea and a great one at that,this is a movie that is not only for those who want to
1,i have seen it many times in a week,i have never heard of it before and i do
1,it was a waste of time and money,it 's not a great movie but it 's
1,trying to make a movie about a man is not a good thing,trying to be a little more serious and more intelligent than the original i
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful,the movie was a bit too long for me
1,it is a shame that such a great actor could not be,it 's a shame that this movie is not for everyone
1,bizarrely it 's not the same as the first one,bizarrely the film is a complete mess of a film
1,so i was expecting to be entertained and i do n't,so i do n't have a problem with the movie
1,some of the scenes are just a little slow and the story is too predictable to be interesting,some scenes were so bad that they could have been cut to a chair and a little bit longer
1,just as a person who has to do it is a,just a few years later he was a great actor
1,totally different from the usual hollywood fare,totally different from a lot of movies i
1,snoop dogg is great as the evil,snoop dogg is a great actor
1,did n't you know it would suck,did i mention that this is the first
1,a lot of the scenes were shot and edited in the same way as if they were in,a lot of the film has been done before but it 's a good movie to see
1,it 's a shame to see a film,it is n't even worth a watch
1,it 's the kind of film that makes you think and you 'll be able to see it as a comedy,it 's the only movie that i have ever seen and i have never seen a worse movie than that
1,i was n't sure what to expect when i saw the trailer for this movie but i thought the movie,i have n't seen this movie since i saw it in the theater and i was impressed with it
1,whereas i do n't know why the filmmakers were trying to make a sequel so,whereas this movie was made for tv the movie is a little too long
1,as a matter of fact i was not impressed,as a result the film was very well shot
1,the film is a little slow at times but it 's a good film,the film is a very interesting film about a young woman who moves to her
1,while this movie is an excellent film it 's not a bad movie,while i have seen this film many times and have seen it many times
1,louis gossett jr is the only one who has a chance to shine in the role,louis calhern is a fine actor and he does a fantastic job in the movie
1,still it 's not a bad movie,still this is a movie that is n't
1,a good example of how a film can be made,a lot of people are complaining about how bad this is
1,this movie was made in the early 80 's,this movie was made in the late '80s and early
1,normally a good movie to watch,normally the plot is so stupid that
1,it 's not a movie that you will not regret watching,it 's not a good film but the acting is good
1,played by a young man who is a bit of a loser to the point,played by john wayne and the aforementioned ms moore is a very beautiful film
1,the story is very simple and the acting is superb,the film is very well done with excellent performances by all
1,a few scenes of the film that were n't,a good movie that is not a comedy
1,donna is a good character and she 's very likable as the mother,donna reed is excellent as the mother and the daughter of a rich girl
1,other than that it 's just not that funny,other than that it was a pretty good show and
1,rambo 's story is about a group of four men who go to the island to,rambo and his mate are a group of people who are killed in the woods
1,what is more important is the fact,what 's with the whole thing
1,um the movie is about a young man who has been living,um i 've seen this movie many times in a row
1,i was expecting a good movie and i was expecting a lot of fun,i was so disappointed that i was able to find a copy of this movie
1,it 's a very good film with,it was a very funny movie
1,the film was a bit too dark for,the film 's premise is the same
1,no one is really interested in this,no matter what you 're supposed to be
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful,the film has a lot of good moments but
1,making it to the top of my list of all time favorite,making a film of this caliber is not a good idea
1,then again i do n't think that this film,then i saw a lot of the movie
1,most of the time i had n't read a review of,most of the film takes place in the same building
1,it 's not that i do n't,it 's not a good thing
1,horrified me and a little too harshly,horrified and disgusted by the fact the film
1,the film is about a man who is a,the film 's plot is a bit thin
1,evil dead ii is a very good film and,evil dead ii is a very entertaining movie
1,as a matter of fact i did n't think that the film would end up being a good film,as a matter of fact i have a soft spot for this one and it is a very good movie
1,it is the worst movie ever made,it is a very interesting film
1,that 's what the movie should have been,that 's the way it 's supposed to be
1,what 's more the film is a very,what is the deal with this movie
1,it 's not the best film ever but it is a good,it was the most expensive and funniest of all the movies
1,there is a lot of action in this movie but the story is n't really that good either,there is a lot of action and a lot of action but this is just a movie
1,it is a great movie to watch,it was a waste of time
1,the film is a complete mess,the film 's main character is a
1,it is a very good film,it 's a very good movie and
1,i was n't really sure whether it,i have seen this movie twice
1,i was surprised that the film did n't,i was expecting a lot from it
1,there is nothing wrong with that and i do n't know how it ended,there are some great moments in this film and the film is quite good for
1,i do n't know how it ended up being the worst movie ever made,i was surprised to find that the film was a bit of a mess
1,you know it 's a good idea,you have a very nice film
1,if you want to watch a good movie with a decent story and great acting this is the film for you,if you 're going to make an anti movie with a few twists and turns you should be left with a good
1,so the story is n't that bad either,so i do n't know how this film is
1,most of the time the movie was shot with a digital,most of the time it 's not even that funny
1,the film is a very good film with some great performances from everyone involved,the film 's main drawback is that the film has a very slow pace
1,he 's a little more than he is,he 's not a bad guy but a man
1,as the film continues we see a very unpleasant and unsettling scene where the hero is,as the film opens it is clear that this movie has a very low budget
1,but it 's a great movie,but the movie is a little slow
1,that 's what i thought the director was going,that said it 's a very funny film
1,there are a number of scenes where the camera is shot and shot in closeup,there was no need to make a good movie but i think the film is a
1,i do n't know how to describe this film but,i was expecting a lot more from this movie
1,well the story is n't that great but,well the movie is n't as bad
1,i do n't think this movie is a good film but i would n't have to say it is one of my favorites,i do n't want to ruin this movie but i have to admit that i did n't have the expectation of the movie
1,later the movie is a bit slow but the acting was so bad,later on in the film he 's a young man and a woman
1,probably because of the lack of originality,probably the worst movie i 've seen
1,i'm not a big fan of musicals but i have a fondness for the fact that it was a movie,i'm a big fan of horror movies and this movie is one that i would like to see again
1,and the acting in this movie is just awful,and i do not think that the movie was really
1,it is a shame because this film is so awful that it,it was a great show that had to go to syndication
1,guy is a good actor and the rest of the cast is excellent,guy ritchie 's acting was so bad that i was n't convinced of it

1,watching the movie i felt that i was watching an,watching the movie i was wondering what was that
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was pleasantly surprised at,i was expecting this to be a good movie but it was n't
1,i do n't think that this movie is really bad but it does have a lot of potential,i have seen a lot of movies and this is the first one i 've seen that i can
1,a very good film with some good actors and an interesting storyline,a few years ago i was a little surprised at how much of

1,the acting is horrible the plot is awful,the film is a very good film
1,the film is a very funny one,the film is a complete mess
1,just as the movie goes from a good to the very beginning of the film,just a bunch of people who do n't know what to do with their lives and
1,great acting great story and the characters are great,great movie that is worth watching for its beautiful performances
1,but the film does not make the slightest attempt to make the movie a,but i was not surprised that i had wasted my time on this
1,i'm not sure what i was going to do but,i'm not sure what to say about this movie
1,especially when they were in the film and the movie was shot,especially the scene where the hero is walking through the air
1,being a fan of the series the series was pretty much an exercise in the,being a fan of horror movies i was expecting something more from a movie
1,naturally the movie is n't even a horror movie and it 's a,naturally i was surprised that the film did n't get released theatrically
1,in the end i did n't care,in fact i think the movie was a
1,this is one of the most underrated films ever made,this film is so bad that it 's funny
1,otherwise it is n't a movie that is so bad it is funny,otherwise it is a movie that is n't a good movie to me
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i was surprised,i do n't think that it 's a bad movie
1,i do n't think this was a good movie but,i have n't seen it since i saw it
1,i have never been so disgusted in a life,i was so bored by this film that i was
1,and i think it 's the most overrated movie i have,and that 's the only reason why this movie sucks
1,however the film 's plot is a little weak but the story is so complex,however i have a feeling that the film is n't a masterpiece of art
1,quoting the book and you 'll see what,quoting the script is a good movie
1,the film is very well done,the story was n't that bad
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie starts out as a typical slasher
1,it 's a shame that this is not a good thing,it 's a shame because it 's just not funny
1,first off i was n't impressed,first off this is the only movie
1,it 's the same old time that you 've got to watch it,it 's a shame that such a great actor could n't save this one
1,from the beginning of the movie i knew that it was a bad movie,from the beginning i found myself wondering what would have happened if the movie was
1,example the movie is a complete failure,example a lot of the movie 's plot
1,tyrone power is the best actor in the movie and it 's a shame that this film did n't,tyrone power was a good choice for his role as a villain and he is a good actor
1,there are some great moments and the film is a bit over the top,there is a lot of nudity in this movie but it 's not a bad
1,dw griffith is one of my favorite actors,dw griffith has an excellent performance in the film
1,exactly the same as the first one,exactly what i would have thought was a
1,you can see that this is the first film that made me want,you can tell that the director wanted to make a good movie
1,the movie is very well done and,the movie is a complete mess
1,i have to say this movie is one of the best movies ever made,i was surprised that this movie had n't been released commercially in the us
1,get the dvd and you will be hooked,get a copy of the original and i think
1,peak of a doubt is the worst movie i 've ever seen in,peak is a movie that is n't afraid to be a classic

1,therefor it 's a good movie,therefor i have to agree that i
1,walter brennan 's portrayal of the president is so much better,walter huston plays the part of a young man in a mental
1,it is a very simple story about a,it 's not a movie to see
1,oliver reed is a good actor but he is n't as good as he was,oliver platt 's character was so stupid that i was surprised at the end
1,one of the worst films i have ever seen,one of the most beautiful movies of all time and
1,i have n't seen the original but i 've been a fan of the original,i have n't been able to locate a movie that is so awful and pointless i
1,and it is a shame that the film is n't as bad as it is,and the acting is so bad that it 's almost painful to watch the whole thing
1,i was n't really expecting anything from this movie,i do n't know if it was the fact that
1,there are some very funny moments in,there 's no plot or tension
1,but i think that 's the best thing about the movie and the story,but the movie is not about the war or how it affects people
1,but the movie is not a good one,but the real thing here is the script
1,rupert everett is a great actor,rupert everett is excellent as the conflicted
1,was it really the point that it was in the first place,was this a good idea to make a movie that was n't
1,a lot of the scenes are just too long,a very good movie and a great film
1,prior to the original i was expecting a lot more from this movie,prior to the film it was a very nice and enjoyable movie
1,the film is about a man who has,the film 's plot is very simple
1,it is a very good movie and the acting is great,it 's the same old man who has the same name
1,it 's a pity to see such a bad film,it 's a shame that it 's not as good as
1,and it 's not that the film does not have any real redeeming features,and it 's not a great film it is n't as good as the others

1,god bless the audience for this,god is the best movie ever
1,i do n't think that this movie is the best of the bunch,i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one was so bad
1,to me it 's just that the movie was n't so much of a surprise as it,to be a little too much i do n't care what the point of it is
1,this movie does have some funny moments,this is a movie that i will watch
1,here 's another thing i have to say about,here is where the movie begins to unravel

1,you can tell that the director was trying to create something that was n't really funny,you know that the movie has the best of all the characters in the movie
1,sounds like it was filmed in the same,sounds like a cross between the original
1,now i know that i do n't like this movie,now the film has been released in the us and it
1,with all the hype surrounding it i would have to say the film is not a complete waste of time,with the exception of the first one the film has a very interesting story line and the characters are well developed

1,the acting is horrible and the plot is so lame and so unbelievable,the film is a little slow paced and the acting was terrible
1,the movie is very good and i think that it is the most important aspect of,the film is about a man who is a man of the age of kpax
1,swayze is one of my favorite actors and i 've always been a,swayze 's character is the most interesting character of his entire career
1,the film was a bit long but it did n't really matter,the story is about the same thing as a young man who has
1,major spoiler below a lot of people who have,major quibbles were the casting of the leads

1,i'm not sure if it was intentional or not,i'm not sure why the movie was made
1,i do n't know what to think about this movie,i do n't think it would have been so bad
1,by the time it 's over you will not be bored,by the time you watch this movie you have a great cast
1,make me laugh and i 'll give the film credit to the director for making a film that is n't a masterpiece of art or even a good movie,make sure that it will be a lot better and more importantly it will be remembered for its rightful release of this movie and its a great film
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed,i think it is a good thing because the story
1,the movie is a complete failure,the film is a very good movie
1,that 's a shame because the movie is so good and so good,that is why i think that the movie would have been better
1,the film was a bit of a letdown but it was,the film is about the same thing as the book
1,some of the other reviews are very positive but the,some people may find this a bit too bad
1,he 's a very good actor and,he is a very talented director
1,the movie is not a comedy but it 's a fun,the story is about an aging family and their lives
1,unless you want to watch a movie that has some good actors and a few good lines this movie is for you,unless the film is a bit of a thriller it 's a very good film and one thing that is n't really good
1,and that 's why it 's not funny,and it 's a shame that they did n't
1,aj is a great character actor,aj is a very good actor
1,so i do n't know what it was like,so what 's the deal with the film
1,there is also a very good scene in the movie where the main character,there are many scenes where they 're not even close to the original
1,the film 's plot is a little weak,the film is a little too slow
1,ok i know that 's a good thing,ok so it 's not a movie that is
1,this film is a must see,this is a very good movie
1,hey it 's not a great movie,hey i know it 's not going to
1,sweet but the film is a little bit slow and the story is too predictable to be enjoyable,sweet and funny the movie is not a bad film but it 's a great piece of work
1,sadly the story is n't as good as the first one which is,sadly it is a very good movie and the actors are great
1,it is not a film for everyone,it 's just so funny and so stupid
1,from the beginning to the end it 's not a bad movie but the film is a little slow,from the beginning of the film there 's a lot of the usual clichs that have n't been done before
1,black and white photography is very nice but the music,black and white cinematography is a bit too much
1,this movie is so bad it 's good,this is not a bad film but it is
1,but the film is so bad that it is n't even funny,but the movie does n't have a plot and it is n't that
1,the acting is good and the script was great,the movie is about a group of kids who have
1,i do n't think this movie has a cult following,i have to say the movie was pretty good
1,actually i do n't want to spoil it,actually the movie has an interesting plot
1,i have n't seen the movie since i was in a theater and,i do n't think it 's that bad but it 's not
1,this is the worst film i 've ever seen,this is the first film i have ever seen in
1,i was surprised to find out that this was one of the best movies,i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good movie
1,i was expecting something like the movie to,i think it was a great idea
1,the story is simple but the movie has a very good story and a good cast but i think that is what i would,the film is about a group of young kids who are trying to find the missing loot in the woods of the past
1,i do n't think that it was a bad film,i do n't think this was meant to be a comedy
1,to be honest it was a great movie,to say it 's a bad movie is a
1,watch this movie if you want to see a good horror film with good,watch it and decide that i can watch it over and over again
1,or maybe the director was trying to make the movie a little more realistic,or maybe it is a movie that is n't even worth a look
1,i have seen it several times and i have to agree with,i was surprised to find that it was n't a movie
1,last but not least a very funny film with the,last and only a little bit of a surprise
1,the acting was good but not bad,the acting is horrible and the acting is
1,the film is a bit of a spoof for the first half,the film was a waste of time and money and time
1,the story is a little weak but the story is,the acting was terrible and the script was horrible
1,and i think it was a very nice idea to put the film on a good,and i do n't know what it was like when i saw the first one
1,the film 's premise is a bit confusing,the film is a little slow and boring
1,there are some great scenes but the movie is just a bit too long,there are a few scenes where i found that i was watching a movie with
1,al pacino is the perfect choice for this movie and he 's a fine actor,al pacino is a good actor and he 's a great actor but he is n't
1,license of fury is a great example of how a film can work,license of the living dead is a very entertaining film with a lot of
1,once the film is finished it is a bit of a mess and the movie,once again it 's a great film and it has a lot of fun
1,the film is not about an ordinary person and the way it was done and how the film was made,the acting is good and there are a number of good performances from all the cast including the likes of the
1,i do n't think it 's the best film of the,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad
1,it 's a shame because the movie is so bad and so,it is a great film and a great movie to watch
1,this movie does not even try to be funny but it is n't a bad movie,this is a very good movie and a good film that i recommend to anyone looking for
1,oh and the ending is just plain stupid,oh and a lot of the scenes where they
1,i do n't want to ruin it but it 's just not a,i have seen this movie twice and i have seen it twice
1,i'm not saying that the acting is bad but the script is n't bad,i'm not sure if this movie was supposed to be funny or funny but i
1,after the first hour of the movie i was hooked and i had,after all it 's a movie about the evils of a war
1,earlier in the film he is shown to be the most beautiful of the bunch and he 's not even the same guy he is supposed,earlier in the movie the characters get a chance to shine in the movie and they have to be in a movie with the characters
1,then there is the scene where the two girls are sitting,then the film switches gears and the film becomes unbearable
1,martial arts movies have been made in the late 70 's,martial arts fans are the ones that are the ones who have
1,since this is a movie i would n't have seen it in any of my favorites,since the first time i saw it i thought it was pretty cool and i liked it
1,even the music is n't as good,even if you 're not a fan of
1,culturally inaccurate and not very exciting,culturally accurate in the first place
1,i was surprised to see how many people have been in the cinema and that this film is a must see,i do n't know what it 's like but i have to say that i am a fan of the book and
1,i do n't think that it is a bad thing,i was surprised to learn that the movie was made by
1,no matter how much you try to be a movie about the characters you just want to see,no one is going to be a fan of this film but it is a good movie
1,one of the best movies i have ever,one of my favorite movies ever made
1,intimate to watch and a bit of an action film,intimate and exciting in a sense of the word it is
1,not that it 's funny but it 's,not to mention the acting was horrible
1,even though this is a good movie it 's a great film and a,even the music is n't as good as some of his other movies
1,she 's not a great actress,she is a very beautiful actress who
1,and it is not the same as the first movie,and the film is a bit of a bore
1,and it was the last film i 've ever seen,and i think the film is a bit of a stretch
1,it 's a shame that the film is not as good as its,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is n't bad
1,you 'll be glad you did,you 'll have to watch the movie
1,a good movie to watch for all,a lot of people have commented on it
1,wait for this movie to get released,wait for the movie to end
1,very few movies have been made in the past,very little of the movie 's success is that it
1,spend a few hours of time on this turkey and i 'll be damned and say,spend a few minutes of the movie trying to get the movie to work out
1,a few of the other actors are great,a good movie that will make you laugh
1,for a movie that is a bit slow paced and a bit too,for me the best performance was the performance of the young man
1,but the film 's main flaw is that,but the movie is a complete mess
1,well i guess i do n't have to pay for it to get any worse,well it 's a great film and i recommend it to anyone looking for a good
1,into the movie the viewer has the feeling that the director has been influenced by the,into the mix of the two leads the film is a bit slow and slow
1,when i saw it i was n't impressed,when the film is over the top and the
1,the film is a complete mess of a film that 's not worth a,the film has a very strong plot and the actors are all good
1,instead we are left to ponder about the plot which is so predictable that it,instead it was an insult to the intelligence of the viewers and the audience
1,it was a very good film with a great deal of action,it 's a shame because the story line is very good
1,the film is about a woman who has to deal with her mother 's death,the movie starts out with a bunch of people trying to find the killer
1,then there 's the fact that the film is a bit slow and it does n't seem like,then there are some very funny scenes that make it hard for me to laugh at it
1,i was so excited about this one that i was expecting to see a lot more,i have n't read the book so far and i do n't think it was the worst
1,about the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was n't a movie,about halfway through this film is about a young woman trying to find out who she is
1,generally i think the film is a bit,generally the story is not that bad
1,kathryn danes is also a very strong woman who is,kathryn forlani plays the young daughter and her daughter
1,but the story is so bad that it becomes laughable,but the film has a few moments of unintentional humor and
1,yes it is a little bit too much but it 's a bit of a stretch,yes the acting is good and the story is very good and the actors are all very
1,john cusak 's performance is a bit stiff and i do n't agree with the other,john goodman is a great actor but i do n't know what it was like
1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the characters are stupid the characters are stupid,the film was shot in a very small budget and the production values are very low
1,every single character in the movie is a stereotype and a stereotype to,every character is either a parody or a stereotype of the characters
1,ambitious and funny the first time around and i do n't think it,ambitious characters and a few of the supporting characters are all excellent
1,half the time i was n't able to sit through it and,half way through this movie i had to sit through it
1,instead of a film that has a few flaws and some of,instead of a good story it was n't even that bad
1,just like the other movies this one is not a good one,just as a film about a young woman in a mental institution who
1,a lot of people have said that this is,a very funny movie with a good cast
1,everything about it was so bad it could n't have been any worse,everything is a bit contrived and the story is a little weak and it
1,however the movie has a lot of potential,however the movie is a bit too long
1,hmmm i have to say i was a bit disappointed,hmmm i do n't think this was supposed to be a
1,c'mon i know this movie is supposed to have appealed to the masses but it,c'mon i know that the film is n't a complete waste of my time
1,actually it 's not a movie that 's so bad it 's funny,actually i have to admit that this movie was very bad and it was
1,again i have to admit that the movie is very good,again it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen
1,as a movie it was a very poor movie,as the story continues the story begins to unravel and
1,we are shown in a different world,we have to see the movie
1,nightmarish is the best of all the batman series,nightmarish and disturbing this movie is a must see
1,i was surprised by the fact that this movie is not about the,i have to say that this is the best of its kind
1,while this film is an attempt to make a movie about a man who is not a good person he 's a very human and a very human and,while i am not sure if i was watching a film that was meant to be the one that made it the first movie i was n't impressed
1,not that i have any idea why it 's a film or a movie it is a very bad,not only does it take place in the middle of nowhere but the movie is a complete mess

1,they were all in the movie and i was n't sure whether it was a comedy or,they are all in a very good place and the movie does n't make any sense
1,firstly this movie was a waste of time to watch,firstly i have a feeling of gratitude that i can see

1,bronson 's performance is the only one i 've ever seen him in,bronson is a good actor but the rest of the cast is just plain
1,he is a very good actor,he was a very good director but

1,the film was a little too much to be,the film 's premise is a little confusing

1,a lot of the movie is a bit slow and slow but it does,a few minutes of the movie are shot in the middle of nowhere

1,the film has a very strong and intriguing look at how people can be treated,the movie starts out with an interesting premise but then the movie ends abruptly
1,i have seen this movie twice and it was very good,i was so bored by that i was laughing at the screen
1,a very funny film that is not a comedy it is,a good example of how a film can be made

1,but the film is n't as good as,but the film has a few faults
1,hopefully they will get a chance to do so,hopefully the film is a bit too long but it
1,describing the film 's success is a film that is a little too hard to follow,describing the film 's success in the form of a film maker and a woman in the
1,this is one of the best movies,this movie was a great movie
1,definitely not the best movie ever made but,definitely the best film of the year
1,most of the time it 's just not a good movie,most of the actors are good but the story is so weak

1,when the film is finally released the film becomes very boring and the,when i saw this movie i thought it was a great movie
1,honestly i do not think that this movie was made by a 14 year,honestly this is a very good movie with a great deal of action
1,the acting is very bad and the story is just plain stupid,the film 's premise is a bit of an insult but the film
1,goldie hawn is the only reason to watch this film and it 's worth noting,goldie hawn is a great actor and is the best thing in this movie
1,the film is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes and,the movie is very well done and it is very well done
1,of course the only way i could describe this movie was that it was so bad it was n't even good enough to be a bad,of course it 's not that the film does have a good plot but it does n't have the potential to be a good film
1,as i watched this film i was very impressed and i did not find the ending to,as for the acting it was n't that bad but it was a little too bad
1,i do n't know what this film was supposed to do,i do not think that the film is worth watching
1,starts the story and the characters are introduced to a group of young people who are trying to find a way to save,starts off promisingly with a few minutes of pure boredom the movie starts off as an interesting premise but it does n't

1,he 's not even a good guy,he 's a very good actor but he
1,you have to wonder what the movie is trying to say,you know it 's a bad movie but it 's not a
1,i have to agree with the reviewer who said that the movie is not a,i have seen this movie several times and i still have n't seen it
1,however the film is n't a bad film it is n't as bad as the first one,however the film 's main flaw is the fact that the film is not as good as the
1,the story of a young woman who,the movie was n't even bad
1,i'm not going to say that the movie is a bit of,i'm glad that i did n't pay to watch this movie
1,there was no real reason why it was n't available on dvd,there is a lot of good acting and a few good actors but
1,mind you i do n't want you to,mind you it 's a good thing
1,jonathan pryce is a good actor as the villain,jonathan shields is excellent as the young and loving wife

1,travellers are not a bunch of characters,travellers are always a lot more fun to
1,editing was good and the story line was,editing is ok but it is not
1,none of the characters seem real,none of the actors are particularly good
1,dean jagger plays a very good guy who is a very good actor but is a bit over the top,dean cain is an excellent actor and he is a good actor but this is not his best role
1,i do n't think this movie would have been much much more if they had been given the opportunity to make,i do n't think that it is possible to watch it again and again but it 's worth a look
1,some of the scenes were filmed as,some of the acting was good
1,as i watched the whole thing i kept hoping that someone would make a sequel,as for this film it was n't a good film but it was not

1,andrews plays a young man who is trying to find a way to,andrews and his cohorts are a bit of a stretch to behold
1,however it is not a film that you 'll see in your own lifetime and you will probably be disappointed,however it is the story of a young man 's life and the relationship between his son and his son who
1,somewhere between the two men is a bit too long,somewhere along the way he 's a bit of a jerk
1,who cares if the director is trying,who would have made it better
1,this is a movie that is so bad i almost fell asleep during the whole production and it was just awful,this is a movie that is n't afraid to make you laugh at the jokes and jokes that are made to be
1,oh and the ending was n't really a surprise ending,oh and i do n't know why i did n't get
1,based on a true story the story was very well developed,based on a true story of the life of a man in

1,the film was a little slow but it was not,the acting is very good but the script is so awful

1,jack lemmon plays a young man who is sent to a wheelchair to investigate,jack nicholson is one of the most talented actors of the 20th century
1,this was the first movie that i saw in the theater and it was a very pleasant surprise,this is a movie that is not just a vehicle for the director 's imagination but also because it
1,mickey rooney plays the role with a very,mickey rooney is a very talented actor
1,soon after he has been kidnapped by the police he is sentenced to investigate and murder him,soon enough the film begins with a young girl who gets a bit of a makeover on the
1,an excellent example of what is the best movie ever,an excellent film with great performances by the actors
1,first i was a bit skeptical when the film,first of all it was n't a movie
1,i have n't seen the first two films in the series but i have to admit,i have to say i was very impressed with the movie but it was not
1,the film has some good points to it but it 's not,the film 's story is a simple one but the acting and direction
1,i do n't know why i was n't laughing at it,i have to admit that i am not a fan of the
1,i think it 's a shame that they made it to dvd,i do n't know how many times i 've been able to watch
1,there 's also a lot of nudity in,there is no reason for this film
1,the film has a very good story,the acting is horrible the story is awful
1,trek has been released on dvd for the last 20 years,trek is the only one that is worth the money
1,but the film is not a bad movie,but i do n't know what the real purpose
1,even when the film 's plot is revealed in flashback the movie is about as close to,even though the movie is not as good it has to offer some of the best
1,for a movie like this you 'll be able to,for a while it 's a very good film
1,i do n't understand what the point of this is,i was n't expecting a lot of the movie but i
1,as the film progresses we get to see a bunch of people in a different situation,as for the rest of the film i was expecting something like that to happen but it
1,what is with the way the story unfolded,what a waste of a great cast
1,and it is the best of the two,and i do think that it was the most
1,this movie is so bad that it becomes laughable,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,all i can say is that i am a huge fan of the original,all in all this movie is a complete waste of your time and a waste

1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous and the acting is bad,the film has a lot of action scenes and it does have a few
1,the film is a very good film,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,and i do think the director should have,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,there is a lot of action and the acting,there is a lot of action and suspense
1,lots of action scenes are thrown into the,lots of people are killed and killed
1,it 's a shame that the producers decided to make a movie that would make the audience think that it,it is the story of a woman and her son who live in new york and reunite to survive
1,the movie was a complete failure to sit through and i was bored,the movie has a lot of action and the acting is pretty good
1,sorry i did n't have the same opinion as this movie is,sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever
1,back in the early 1980s i had a fondness for a movie that had me laughing so hard,back to the film it 's a little bit too long and the story is very predictable
1,this is the first film i have ever,this movie is a waste of time
1,you have to see it to believe it or not,you can see the director and his crew of the actors
1,after seeing this movie i was expecting a lot,after all the movie is a complete mess
1,you know that the movie is not a bad movie but it,you can tell that this is a low budget horror film
1,it was a great movie for the,it 's a very good movie
1,i have never seen a film that i,i was surprised to see the movie
1,but i have to say i did n't like it so,but i do n't think it 's a great thing
1,but it is not as good as it is to be a movie,but the film is a bit slow and the ending is too abrupt
1,i do n't think this movie was made in the us but it is still a very enjoyable film,i have to say that this movie was very funny and i was surprised that i had n't seen it
1,plenty of action and lots of action,plenty of people are killed in the process
1,your only real gripe with this film is that the story is n't a complete mess,your only real complaint is that it is so bad it makes you wonder how much more
1,i do n't think i can see,i have seen it many times
1,move to a small town and the city,move to the top of my lungs
1,i was expecting something like this to be a good movie but the acting,i have to say that this film was a total flop for me
1,the film is a very good film and it,the film is a complete failure to watch
1,each character was so different and the movie is a little too slow and boring,each character is a stereotype of a man who has a heart attack and a very
1,two of the most beautiful and memorable scenes of a classic film,two of my favorite movies are the ones where the main character is
1,facts are n't answered by the film,facts like this are not funny
1,the acting is horrible and i do n't,the film is a very funny movie
1,before you know it the acting is n't that bad,before i wrap up this film i was very impressed by
1,kids' movies are not always a bad thing,kids' movies are a lot better than this
1,what a waste of time and money,what is this supposed to be about
1,just like the other reviewer who commented on the,just do n't expect a lot of action
1,when the film is over the top and the actors seem to be trying,when i watched the first episode of the show i was really surprised
1,this is a very good movie,this film was made in a small
1,you 'll see the movie in its entirety,you 'll never get to know the characters
1,as a fan of the original i can see the point of,as a fan of the book this film was a disappointment
1,its not a movie that is n't funny or even,its the most annoying thing i 've ever heard
1,meanwhile the movie is a very bad attempt to make a statement about how to be,meanwhile the two men find their husbands and the two lovers of the same husbands
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and you have seen a few of the other films you will,if you are looking for a movie about a group of people you 're not sure who you are
1,i do n't think that the movie is so,i think this movie was made for kids
1,do n't waste your time on this movie,do n't be fooled by this movie
1,vincent d'onofrio is a good actor but he,vincent d'onofrio is great as the villain
1,the movie was made for tv and,the film is very slow moving
1,using the same plot rehashed the film to get a new perspective on the audience and the,using the same old formula that is the case with the first one and the first
1,the film is a complete mess,the acting is very bad and the
1,the acting is horrible and the story is just a little too much to ask,the film 's plot is very thin and the acting is n't that good
1,anyway the movie has a very good plot and is not a,anyway i was n't sure what to expect from this film
1,and that 's the reason why i gave this movie a 1 out of,and i have no idea what it was like for the first time
1,novel is the best film of the year,novel by the same title and the same director
1,the film 's main drawback is that it is not even close to the book,the film is a bit long but there are so many things that make you think
1,the film is a very good one,the movie has some good moments but it
1,i have never seen the movie so i can watch it over and over again,i was n't really expecting a movie to be so bad but i was n't
1,i do not think the filmmakers would have had the chance to,i do n't know how many people who liked this film
1,the film is a very interesting one to watch,the film is not about a man who 's a
1,certainly a good movie but not a bad movie,certainly a good film for those who like the genre
1,all in all i would recommend it to everyone but for those that are,all the characters are all so bad that they 're just plain bad
1,however this is a movie that is not worth,however the story is not that great either
1,it 's not a movie for everyone but the,it is the best of the two films
1,inside of the film i was impressed,inside of the house of frankenstein and the
1,but i was n't sure if it was really,but the movie is n't a good film
1,an excellent film with a very touching ending,an excellent film that i recommend watching for the
1,also the movie is n't even worth mentioning,also the movie does n't have to be a
1,so the film has a few funny moments,so i guess i can see that the film
1,one of the best movies i have seen in,one of the best movies of the year
1,avoid this movie at all costs,avoid this movie like the plague
1,we have a bunch of people who have a lot of fun and they 're all,we are supposed to sympathize with the characters but they are all in the way
1,the movie has a great cast and a very good story,the film is a complete mess of a film that is so
1,pharaoh is a very good movie and it is not a movie to be seen,pharaoh is the only person that is n't the most interesting and important to the story
1,i was n't expecting a lot of this film and it was very disappointing,i do n't think this movie is the best of the series and certainly the
1,there are some good performances in here and the,there are some good scenes in the film
1,this was a good idea to put it mildly,this movie was so good that it was a good
1,but the movie is n't that bad,but this is a film that is not
1,speedway 's character is a bit of a,speedway is the best of the series
1,he is a great actor and a good man but he is not in a,he is not the only one who can be forgiven for being the best
1,if you want to see a good film that is a little slow and boring at least you can find this film funny,if it was n't a little bit of an improvement it would have been a good movie if it were n't for the technical
1,while i do n't know what to say i was surprised that the film was made in,while i was not impressed by the story i was n't expecting much from this film
1,the film is a little slow but it 's a good movie to watch,the film is very good in the way that the characters are portrayed
1,humor is the only reason for the film 's audience to invest the opportunity to watch it in,humor is n't a problem but the film is not as bad as the first two films
1,luckily i was n't impressed with the,luckily it 's the same thing
1,watch the movie and you will see how much it 's,watch this movie if you 're looking for a laugh
1,go see it if you want to be entertained,go see the film and you 'll be pleasantly surprised
1,the film has no real plot,the film is a complete mess with
1,his character is a little more than he is,his wife 's daughter is a very good and very
1,the film is a bit of a spoof but,the film is a bit slow and slow
1,it 's the story of two young men in a very humdrum situation that,it 's a shame that such a great movie could not be made
1,wow i do not think that this film is a total waste of time,wow i 've seen the original movie and i can safely see that there are
1,it is a great story and i recommend this movie,it 's a shame because the plot is a lot of
1,the movie is very well made,the film is a very funny film
1,sex is the only thing that makes the movie so,sex is the only reason to see this movie
1,it 's the same thing with the same old same old same,it 's a pity that this is not available on dvd
1,a lot of people have commented on this film and the film,a good movie with great performances and a very interesting ending
1,as for the rest of the cast it was very,as for the story it 's a little confusing
1,in fact the only good part is that the movie is a bit slow,in the first film he is a man who has a heart attack and is
1,these are the two main points of view,these are not a bunch of people who are
1,i have n't seen this movie in a long time,i was so disappointed when i saw this movie
1,they were the only ones who were,they 're all a good thing
1,i was n't impressed by this movie,i think that this film is a must
1,then the story is a bunch of people and their,then i saw the first episode of the series
1,definitely the worst film i have ever seen,definitely a movie that will appeal to anyone who
1,this is a very good movie,this is a very funny movie that
1,in the end the film has a very very bad script and is not even worth mentioning the title of the movie,in a way the film is so bad that it is hard to imagine anyone who has ever seen a movie that actually
1,his character was so unlikable that he was n't believable,his character is so unlikable that he is so unlikable and
1,the film is a very interesting one,the movie has some good actors
1,legendary director robert altman has made a good film,legendary actors who are so good in this film are
1,this film is a must see,this is a film that is so
1,by the time it came to the head of the,by far the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's a shame because the movie is not very funny or funny,it 's a pity because i think the director and director should not have
1,ah the movie was a total mess,ah the movie is a complete mess of
1,an example of how the director was able to create,an excellent film that is very well worth watching
1,ray is a good character and he does n't have to be,ray liotta is one of the best actors of all time
1,those who do n't like this show are either very funny or just want to laugh at the jokes and laughs that they,those who do n't have the slightest clue of how to make a movie about a man who has a good heart
1,she 's not the only actress that i could identify with,she has a good voice and she is the perfect actress
1,an excellent movie that is worth watching,an excellent cast and a great cast
1,many of the actors are very good especially the ones who have the ability to shine,many of the scenes were shot in color and were used for a cheap camera

1,i was n't sure whether the movie was intentional or not,i do n't know if the film is supposed to be a
1,i was n't sure whether the director intended to be a little more of the director or the director but the director was n't trying to,i have to admit i did n't like the film because the movie was so boring and boring that the movie is a complete mess
1,a very enjoyable film that is n't just about the best known of people in hollywood 's history,a very funny movie that 's not only for everyone but also for those that enjoy it
1,whenever you have a film you have no idea about the characters are the same,whenever the movie ended i thought the film was a little slow and boring but i

1,and i do n't know how many times it,and the ending was pretty bad as well
1,i was expecting a lot more than i could chew the movie but it was n't a total waste of time,i have seen this film and i can only hope that the next generation will find it a bit more interesting
1,without the sex scenes the film is a little bit of a bore,without a doubt the worst movie i have ever had to sit through
1,we have a bunch of people who are not so much,we have a lot more to say about the movie
1,as for it i would have given it a higher rating,as for the acting it was a bit of a letdown
1,4 the acting was n't bad but the story line was horrible and the ending was so predictable,4 out of 10 for the fact i was watching this movie and i was so disappointed
1,also the ending is so ridiculous that,also the film is very good
1,he is the only person who has to be one of those,he is a very talented actor and he is very believable
1,for the first time in a while i thought that this was,for the first time the cbc was still a big hit
1,the film 's plot is a mess,the story is about two young men who

1,when the first one was made i was expecting to find the,when the movie was over i could n't help but laugh
1,my only complaint with the movie is that it 's not even a good,my only complaint was that it was n't even nominated to be nominated
1,note the fact that the story is so stupid that i ca n't help thinking that it is n't even remotely entertaining,note the movie 's plot twist is n't really that interesting and the characters do not even have the decency to pull it

1,i think that 's a shame because the movie has a good plot but it 's just too much to make it good,i do n't know what the hell was going on but i did n't care for the character of a girl who was supposed
1,often the film is a bit too much to bear but i do recommend it,often the film 's main flaw is that it is not a comedy but a drama
1,opening night is a movie that i would recommend to all,opening with the first one being shot at the end of the
1,it 's just not a good idea and the movie is n't,it 's not even the best of all of the other
1,some of the actors are n't bad but they 're,some people say that it 's a bad thing

1,for a film of this type to have the same impact as the first one i think it,for those who are not familiar with the genre of films this movie is a must watch
1,anyone who has ever seen the film should see the original,anyone who has seen the original series will be disappointed
1,many people have commented on that,many of the scenes are very good
1,i have seen a number of films that have a good story line,i was n't sure whether it was a comedy or a drama
1,about the only thing that made it worth seeing was the fact that i saw it on cable tv,about the only redeeming factor of the film was the fact that the director had to use the same technique
1,apparently the director and the director did n't know what to do,apparently it 's a shame that they did n't make it
1,and i do n't know why this movie is so bad it 's good,and it 's a shame that the film has been made in the us
1,despite the fact that he 's not the most interesting person in the world i do n't think,despite being a little bit of a letdown the film does not have much of an impact
1,for the first time in the life of a man who was,for the first time the producers decided to make a movie

1,the film was a waste of money and time and money,the film is very slow moving and the acting is terrible
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is a great movie for those
1,just a few minutes later it 's a movie that i would n't have seen as a whole,just as the movie goes on the whole story is just a little too much for me to care
1,because of the fact that the film is a bit,because the movie was a little slow and boring
1,every character is either a stereotype or a stereotype,every time i watch this movie i was reminded of

1,it is not a movie that will appeal to everyone but for all its investment,it 's the only way this movie can be seen as a movie that is not
1,i think the movie 's biggest problem is the lack of a story,i have to say that i am a fan of the genre but i
1,while the film was shot on location it 's a real treat for the entire cast,while i am not a fan of the genre of movies i still find it hard to
1,derek 's performance was so bad it could have been better suited to his character,derek and his wife are the only two people who are willing to take their jobs

1,storm 's edge is a film that is not a complete waste,storm and the beast are the best thing about the film
1,or maybe it 's just that the director and the actors were n't going for the script and it was n't,or the fact it is n't a movie that is a bit too long for the audience to handle and to appreciate

1,dennis hopper is a fine director who has a great talent for producing this movie,dennis hopper plays his usual self and does a pretty good job of playing the villain
1,i have never been a big fan of his films but this movie,i was surprised by how many people were involved in this production
1,i'm sure the filmmakers were trying to make a point about how,i'm not sure why this film is so good to watch
1,this is not a movie about a group of people who get to the same destination in the same way,this is one of those movies where you can watch it with a bunch of friends and have it on tape

1,i was n't expecting a good movie,i was n't impressed by the movie but
1,is it that the movie is about a bunch,is it a comedy or a horror film
1,for the first half of it i was bored and disappointed,for a film about a man in a suit who has a
1,nevertheless it 's a good movie,nevertheless it is a good film
1,there 's nothing wrong with this movie,there are many scenes that do not make
1,and the acting is so bad that i actually cringed at times,and i think the film is a bit too dark and too slow

1,bob newhart 's performance is very good,bob newhart is a great actor but he
1,i was expecting something more from this film than i expected,i was n't sure if it was the director 's fault or
1,this is a very good movie,this is a movie that is a
1,i do n't think that it is that good,i do n't know how many of you know it
1,were they trying to make a film out of it,were they supposed to be a little more than the typical
1,if you 're looking for a good movie that 's not bad enough it will probably be your ticket,if you want to watch a movie about a man who 's been kidnapped and you do n't want to
1,the film was shot in a very tight manner and was very well made but the script was so weak that it could have been a lot better,the film is a bit slow but the ending is so abrupt and the ending is so abrupt that i could n't help but feel sorry for the guy
1,the film was shot in the seventies and the director had no idea of what it was supposed to,the film is a complete mess of a film and it is n't a complete waste of time
1,both of those films are a lot better than,both films have a great deal of humor
1,i was surprised to see that it was a movie,i have never heard of this movie but it 's not
1,altho it 's not a great movie it,altho it 's not a great movie
1,quote of the movie is the fact,quote is a very good movie
1,i was n't impressed by the movie but,i was n't impressed with the film
1,however i think the movie 's biggest flaw is that it has a lot of problems,however the movie is n't as much of a comedy and as a vehicle to watch it
1,no matter how many times you watch it you 'll be able to see it in the theater or the theater,no one has any motivation for this film and the director has to be a little too hard to find a film
1,yes it 's not as good as the book but it is a great movie,yes the movie is a little slow but it 's a bit slow and the ending
1,well i was n't disappointed by the ending,well the movie was a bit of a mess
1,the acting is good and the story is good,the film has a few moments of humour and some
1,the acting is horrible and the script is so bad that it,the movie has a great soundtrack and the music is great

1,and i think the movie is a bit too long for me,and that was the only reason why i gave this movie 2 stars
1,the movie starts with some interesting characters and the story,the film is a little bit slow and boring
1,state of affairs is one of the best and most,state of the art is not a bad thing
1,it is n't a bad movie,it is a shame that this movie
1,i'm not sure if the director is supposed to be a comedy or a,i'm not sure what it is but this film is a complete failure
1,the acting is horrible the script is horrible and the acting is horrible,the movie is a little slow but the story line is so interesting that
1,but the real problem is that it is not as good as,but the story is a little thin and it is n't
1,the film is a very good one with the same amount,the acting was good and it 's a great movie
1,movies such as these days and the same is the case with the first film,movies like this should be released in the united states and it 's still a shame
1,i do n't think this movie was meant to be a sequel but it was a great movie,i do think that the film is a bit slow but i think it was made for tv and
1,it is a great film to watch and it will make you cry,it is a very interesting film and it 's a shame that the movie
1,well the movie is a good example of how,well i have a problem with this film
1,these two are not the same ones who have no clue about their own problems,these are two of the best movies ever made and i think that it is a
1,they 're not funny but the acting is so bad,they have no idea of what they were doing
1,liza minelli 's performance was a bit too wooden and the film was not,liza minelli is a great actress but she is n't a great actor
1,in a way i do n't care what the point of the movie is,in a nutshell this film is n't even worth the time to watch it
1,though the film is not as good as the first one it 's a pretty good one,though it 's a good thing that the movie is n't a complete waste of time and money
1,american audiences have not been able to understand it,american graffiti is a film about the power of a
1,finally the movie is not about the war and its subject matter,finally the film is about a young woman who lives in a small
1,85 years later the two are the only ones in the film that will make you feel a connection to the characters and you 'll find the story,85 years later the two of them have to deal with the same problems and the two of them are married to a group of men who have been
1,i was surprised to see that he was the most talented actor in the world,i do n't know if it is the fact that the movie is so bad it
1,the film is a bit long,the acting was good the script was
1,i was expecting the same to be a movie,i have seen this movie and i have to say
1,unfortunately this movie is a complete waste of time and,unfortunately it 's not as bad as it sounds
1,and i was n't expecting much,and that 's not the only explanation
1,it is a shame that such a film,it 's a shame because the movie has a
1,it 's a shame that it was not released theatrically,it 's not the worst movie ever but it 's not
1,i was expecting a movie to get a few laughs and i was n't expecting a good movie but this,i do n't understand why people would rate this movie a zero but i would give it a 1
1,i do not think this movie has any appeal whatsoever,i do n't know how many times i 've seen this
1,here 's the breakdown of the movie,here we have a movie that is so
1,it 's not that the movie is n't bad,it is a shame because the movie is a complete
1,the movie is about a young woman who,the acting in this movie is terrible
1,in this case the movie was made for the sole purpose of being an action movie,in the end i was n't really expecting anything from the movie but the movie was very
1,this film is a complete mess,this is one of the best movies
1,this was the worst of the worst,this film was made in a very small
1,i think that this was an excellent movie,i have n't seen it since i was 12
1,this movie is not a good film and it does not make any,this is the kind of movie that i would n't watch again
1,you can tell that this is not the,you 'll be able to watch it
1,although the movie is a little dated it is still very good and it is not for everyone,although this is not a great movie it has some of the best acting i have ever seen
1,it is a very good movie that i would recommend,it 's a shame to see him in a movie that
1,in fact it is a bit of a stretch,in fact the whole cast seems to have no idea
1,take the time to see this movie,take a look at the cast the movie
1,secondly it 's a great film to see,secondly it is a movie that is not a
1,the acting was terrible and i did n't,the movie is not a good film
1,best of all is the fact that it is,best line is the one with the girl
1,simply put this movie is a great example of how the film is,simply because the film is so bad that it 's almost unwatchable
1,but the real reason why this movie is n't,but it is also a very enjoyable film
1,mr bean is the perfect villain for the role of a young woman,mr and mrs smith 's daughter is a woman who 's a child and
1,why did the farmers not kill the president,why is it that this film is so awful
1,eventually the story of a man who is a young woman who is married with a man named evie who was raised by the death of her son,eventually the story of this man 's life is revealed and the movie is about the man who is the son of his son and the son who is
1,for those who have n't read the book i think it is a good movie,for a long time it seems as though the writers had been trying something more interesting
1,for the first time the film was released in the early 1980 's,for a movie that was a bit too long it was n't the worst
1,nothing really happened in this movie and it,nothing is a bit of an improvement
1,this movie is a must see for,this is a very bad movie
1,it 's just a shame to see such a great film,it 's a shame to see this movie on dvd and not
1,in the end it 's a good movie to watch,in this case it 's a pretty good film
1,for those who like to be a fan of the book this is,for those who like the first movie you wo n't be disappointed
1,from the very start of the movie i was n't,from there on the whole thing is a joke
1,the acting is horrible and the script is so bad that you wonder,the acting is very bad and the plot line was very predictable
1,i was so excited about this film,i have n't been so disappointed by this
1,this movie is a complete waste of money,this film was a complete waste of time
1,i do n't think that the movie has a very redeeming quality but the story itself is very,i do n't know how many times i have ever seen this movie but it was n't
1,saw a preview screening in the theater and was looking at,saw the movie at the toronto film festival in london
1,the movie was a bit of fun to watch,the acting is horrible the script is awful and the
1,unlike many of the other reviewers here i was very impressed with the acting of the,unlike the other reviewers i found this a little too much to be geared at
1,he was a little more than he was in the first movie and,he is a great actor and is very believable as the lead
1,the acting and directing was terrible,the movie is not a bad movie
1,there is a lot of action in this film and it,there are so many things that i can relate to
1,this is one of my favorites and it is a,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,zerbe is the only reason i can remember when this,zerbe is one of the finest actors in cinema
1,cant believe that it was n't the first movie that i,cant deny the fact that this was a madefortv movie
1,but the movie is a bit of an exercise in the genre and,but the real problem is that the film is a complete bore
1,it 's just a little too bad to be made in the first place,it is a movie of sorts of a young man who is in love with
1,what a waste and this film is,what 's more interesting is that the characters
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was not a comedy but it 's a very good movie,i was surprised to discover the whole thing and the film 's plot was so stupid it could have been written
1,not a great film but a solid one,not a bad movie but it 's good
1,for me the best of it was the scene where the father was walking around the room,for the first half of the movie the viewer is left wondering why they did n't make it
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have n't seen it since i first
1,hilarious but not as good as some of the others i 've seen,hilarious and entertaining and the movie is a great example of how to get
1,i was expecting a movie to be a bit of a mess,i do n't know why i did n't like this film
1,i have n't seen it in years and i still have to watch the movie again,i think that the director should stick to a movie that is not a good one
1,if you 're a fan of the book you 'll probably be disappointed,if you 're looking for a good movie to watch with friends and a
1,the film is very well done and the actors are very good,the film 's plot was very good and the actors were well developed
1,the film is a little slow and the story is n't as good as some of the others,the movie is about as bad as it gets but i guess it 's just a little too long
1,injuries were made in this film but,injuries were not always the same
1,a lot of people have commented on this film and the film itself is not very well done,a few years later he 's been beaten up by a group of bikers who are n't even close
1,your only real complaint is that it is a little too slow,your only wish to see this movie was that it 's so bad
1,nonetheless i would n't have to say that the movie is a complete waste of time,nonetheless i was impressed by the film as i was in the mood for a few scenes
1,it is not a movie that is n't a complete waste of time,it is n't even the story that makes the movie so bad
1,maybe it 's just me but i have to admit that this is one of my,maybe he 's just trying to make it look cool and it does n't matter
1,but i do n't think the director was trying to be funny and i think the movie was a joke,but the film 's only purpose is to make a point about the fact that the film was a little too
1,it 's just a bunch of random,it 's a very good movie
1,alvarado is one of the best actors,alvarado 's character is so unlikable
1,the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous,the film was shot in the same location and
1,because of the fact that they are not all the,because the movie was a complete waste of money
1,the film is a complete mess of a film,the film was a complete waste of my time and
1,he 's a great actor and is very good in this role,he is a very talented man and he 's a great storyteller
1,i do n't know how this movie got made,i have n't read any of the other comments here
1,i have n't seen the film since i was,i have never seen such a bad movie
1,horton is a great actor and he 's a great actor but he 's just not funny,horton 's performance is also good as he plays his role as the villain of the movie
1,setting in the middle of a crowded desert,setting it up for a few laughs
1,the film is a bit of a mess but i think it 's a,the film is very slow paced and the story is a bit confusing
1,and the film is a bit slow and the story line is very slow but the characters are all believable and the plot is intriguing,and i was surprised at how many people i have seen this show and i was so impressed that i was watching a cartoon with a
1,it was a great movie to watch,it was n't a bad idea to be
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film 's plot is very simple
1,simply put this movie has a very bad plot and the acting is,simply put this is a movie that should be seen by everyone
1,so if you 're looking for an entertaining movie to watch a few of the other actors in this flick,so i was surprised that the movie was made by a group of friends and the producers of it
1,or maybe it 's a bit too,or maybe it 's just me
1,the film was a little slow and i was bored,the movie is about a young man named krishna who has
1,if you want to watch a movie with an interesting story then this one is n't,if the story is about a bunch of people who are n't really in the world they
1,this is a great movie and it is a,this is the best movie of all time
1,now i know i 've never heard about it before,now that is the only way of the movie
1,a good example of what a good movie can be,a very funny movie and a great example of how a
1,this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone interested in a story and a very,this is one of the best of the series and it 's not a good movie
1,there 's also some nice scenery and the film is a bit long,there was a good reason for this film to be a classic
1,much of the film 's dialogue is not particularly memorable,much like the first one i thought that the movie was
1,word for this movie was a joke that was not used to describe the plot,word for the movie is that the film has a lot of action scenes and is
1,this film is a very bad movie that is not even funny,this movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys good acting
1,the story was very interesting and the story was good,the story was a little weak but there was a lot
1,i have n't read the novel but i do not know that i have n't read the book,i was n't impressed with the story and it was a bit of a stretch for me to see
1,instead of the typical hollywood fare it 's a big step down,instead we get a movie that has no real plot no plot no
1,vince vaughn is a very talented actor and is a good actor,vince rocca has made the movie a little better and the movie has
1,i have to admit i did not have the patience to see this movie,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was surprised to find that
1,even the actors are n't very good,even the most ardent fan of his films
1,it is not even a movie it is just a movie about a bunch of kids,it is the story of the same old man who was born in prison and the world
1,a very interesting story about a young woman who marries a woman named erik who is now a child,a lot of people are talking about this movie but i think it 's a very good movie
1,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's good,it 's a shame that the movie is not so much more widely
1,on the whole the film is a very interesting one at its finest,on the other hand i have a problem with the film 's lack of
1,he is the most beautiful and talented actor of the,he was a great actor and a good actor
1,music is the best of the three films,music is also the only thing i liked about
1,while the story was not as good it is not a bad movie,while the movie is a little too long and the story itself does seem
1,if it were n't for that i would n't have been able to sit through it,if you want to make a film about a group of people in a small town in

1,but the film has a good deal of humor,but the film is not about the characters
1,in the end the movie is a very good movie,in this case he is a young woman who is married
1,nothing happens and it 's just not,nothing really happens in the movie
1,serling is the most famous director of this film,serling 's direction is a bit slow but the film
1,when the film 's first major star in the credits came from,when he is on screen he is a very likable character
1,okay so it 's not as bad as the first one but it does,okay so i was expecting a movie to be a bit more entertaining
1,this is one movie you should watch and enjoy,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,this is a very good film,this movie is not for everyone
1,note that the film 's main character is the most irritating character ever in,note the film was a bit of the first film in the series
1,let me start with the fact that this is a very bad movie,let 's face it the movie does not have the same message
1,pictures of a great cast are not the only thing that is n't a good thing,pictures were not the same but the film was a bit slow at times and i was
1,of course the story is about a man who is a man in his own right who has been a successful actor,of course there are many many other films that are not so bad that they just do n't make them like that one
1,if you have seen the first two films you will see that this was a great movie,if you 're looking for a movie that is so bad it 's funny then this is the
1,his performance as a man who was the most important character in the movie is just plain stupid,his character was a bit of a jerk and i found myself wishing that the director could n't have
1,thanks to the cast and crew of the film i,thanks for the director 's cut to the dvd
1,i do n't know why i was so impressed with this,i do n't know what to say about this film
1,almost as bad as it gets and it 's still not as bad as it sounds,almost all the actors in this film are all excellent except for the leads who are not
1,the acting is good and the story,the movie is not for everyone
1,i have n't seen the original series but i do n't want to spoil the film for,i was n't sure what to expect but i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,the film 's main character is a very unlikable and very young woman and a very good one at that,the film 's story follows two young men who have a relationship with each other in a small village of ember
1,i was so impressed with the story and it was so refreshing,i have n't read the book so i do n't know what to
1,unrealistic plot and the fact that the film is,unrealistic but it is a very good movie
1,compared to the first film i thought it was very funny,compared to the first two movies i was expecting a good horror
1,i was surprised to see that this was a low budget production,i have to say i have to give it a 1 because it
1,but the film has a very nice touch and is not a bad film,but i have to admit that the film was a complete waste of time
1,my favorite part of the movie is the way that the director,my favorite part is when the girl says the same thing
1,i was surprised to see that the movie,i was n't impressed by this film
1,however the movie has a good deal to it,however it is a film that will appeal to all
1,it 's not even the best,it 's a shame that this was
1,sexual harassment is not a very good thing,sexual tension between the two leads is very well
1,rendition of the story of a man 's journey to find,rendition is a great movie that will keep you watching
1,i was n't really sure if it was a comedy or a horror film,i think the movie is a bit of a bore but it 's a fun
1,pooja is a great actor and the supporting cast is very good,pooja has to be the best person in the film and she is
1,their performances were good but the rest of the cast were,their relationship with each other is a joy to watch
1,watching this movie is a must see,watching it i can understand why
1,the movie is about two men who are trying to escape their families and find themselves trapped inside a house,the movie has a lot of action and some really good scenes but it 's a bit boring and the ending
1,i was expecting a lot more from this film but,i do n't know why i watched this movie
1,this film is so bad that it 's hard to see how,this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,we are supposed to believe that a man is a serial killer,we are left with a very good feeling for the movie
1,flex is a great actor but he,flex is a very good actor
1,again i do not recommend this movie to anyone,again i would have liked to know what the real
1,props were n't as good and the film did n't seem to be that much of a stretch for the viewer,props are not the best of the films but it 's a very entertaining movie with the usual plot devices that are
1,it is a shame to see this,it was a very good movie
1,ben affleck is a very talented actor,ben kingsley was the best thing about this
1,now i have to say i was n't disappointed,now i know that i am a fan of the
1,it 's a pity that the movie is so bad,it 's a shame that the movie is not available on
1,unfortunately this movie was not a good one,unfortunately i do n't have a problem with the
1,and it 's the best thing i have ever seen,and that 's the only reason why i give it a
1,but i do n't want to give the rest of us away,but the film 's main character is not a good guy
1,so the movie is n't that bad,so i have a lot of fun watching
1,while this movie is not a masterpiece it is a very enjoyable film,while i do n't think that the movie is a good movie it is
1,the movie is a bit slow and the ending is a bit abrupt,the film is very well directed and the characters are very interesting
1,it was a waste of time,it 's not a movie that i
1,it 's a pity that they did n't have the decency to do that,it 's a shame because i was so disappointed by the fact that this movie
1,it 's a very funny film,it 's the story of a girl
1,miki is a great actor who is not only in the movie but also a bit of a good actress,miki and her friends are a married couple who have been living in a small town in the past and are
1,like a movie about a woman and her family who were n't afraid of,like the first movie the acting was good and the acting was good
1,there was a lot of potential for the film,there 's a lot of nudity and gore
1,this is a very good movie that is a great example of how a director,this movie is a great example of how a movie is supposed to be
1,i have n't seen the original version but i do n't think that this was one of the best i,i was n't expecting anything more from this film but it did n't really have any redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,most of the time the movie is not even funny,most of the film is about the people who were trying
1,the film 's premise is a little convoluted,the film is a little too much for the
1,do n't get me wrong i did n't like the film,do n't worry about that but it 's worth watching
1,what i did not understand was that this movie was made in a hurry and the director decided to,what is more interesting is how the film is set in the same era as the first film
1,what 's more interesting is that it has,what 's the deal with this film
1,closeups were shot in the head of a camera,closeups of the characters are so much more than they
1,the acting and script is very poor the plot is a joke,the film is about a group of four men who go to a
1,this movie has a very good story and the characters are so believable that it makes you think,this is a movie for the ages of a good family and the kids who are not afraid to
1,the movie was made up of a couple of,the acting was horrible the plot was bad
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed with the story,i was n't expecting anything from this film but i did not expect
1,and that 's what the story of a good man is,and the movie does have some good moments but the movie is
1,have i seen a lot of people 's opinions,have you ever heard of a man who 's been
1,and that 's what makes it so great,and the movie has a lot of action and
1,if you are looking for an action thriller with a good cast and,if you want to watch a great movie that is worth watching
1,if you want to see a film about a group of friends who can act and get into the lives,if i had to give a zero i would have to be a little more forgiving to the film
1,when i first read the book i had to read the book for a,when you watch the movie you 'll see the difference in your face
1,although it is n't a bad movie it 's not a bad one at all it is not a bad film it 's,although the plot is a little thin it still makes it a little too slow and the ending too abrupt for me
1,i do n't know what it is,i have seen this movie and i have
1,had i been watching this film over and over again i would have been a bit sceptical if i 'd had,had the film been done by the same director as the original it would have been a little more enjoyable
1,unless you 're a fan of the original series you should be able to watch the original,unless you 're a diehard fan like me who can appreciate the movie as a whole it will
1,now i do n't think it 's a bad movie but i do n't,now i know it is n't a bad movie but it is n't
1,now that 's a good thing to say,now i have to say i was very impressed
1,if you have a chance to see it then do so,if you are a fan of the book you should be able
1,then again it 's not a good film,then i saw the trailer for this movie and
1,the film was very good and it,the movie is a complete failure
1,the movie is a complete mess of the worst kind of film,the film 's main character is the hero of the story
1,fortunately the film 's only redeeming feature is the presence,fortunately the movie is n't really a good one
1,everything is so bad that i do n't,everything is a little bit too predictable
1,as i mentioned before this is not a film for those who love horror films,as the film opens we are introduced to a couple of characters who are the most
1,director david fincher has a good eye for making films and he has a very low budget and a very good,director michael curtiz has a knack for making a good film about a man who has a very complex life
1,because of this i think that the film is very good,because of this movie 's problems i found it difficult to understand
1,i do n't think i 'll be watching,i have n't seen the movie yet
1,throughout the film the viewer is treated to a sense,throughout the movie i thought the acting was ok
1,anyway the movie is a complete waste of time but the movie does have its,anyway it is the worst movie i 've ever had the pleasure of seeing
1,the acting is good and the story is a bit too thin for a children 's movie,the story is a little confusing but it is a good movie to be seen by everyone and
1,when i was a teenager i had a crush on,when the movie is over i was very impressed
1,many things are wrong in this film,many of the scenes were filmed in the
1,perfectly photographed with a nice cast and great direction this,perfectly photographed and shot in a very realistic manner
1,most of the time it is not very clear that it is n't as good as the original but not as good as,most of the time the movie is set in the middle of nowhere and it 's not really all about the action
1,also the movie is a bit too dark but the story is very interesting,also the ending was so predictable that i could n't help but feel the need
1,it 's a very simple movie,it is a shame to see this
1,a lot of the film 's humor and the humor and humor are all very well done,a very interesting film about a young woman who is sent to a small town to attend an
1,these are the kind of people that should not have been,these are two things that make a film worth watching
1,its a good movie and it 's very funny,its a shame that such a film has never been
1,i was expecting a lot from this movie but it was n't,i do n't think that this movie was made for the sake of
1,the film is not a complete disaster,the story line is so bad that it
1,the film is about a young man who has a son and a daughter who,the film 's plot is about the same thing as the other two films
1,but the movie is not about the characters and the plot is,but the story is a little too weak to be true
1,a good movie for the whole family,a very funny movie and a great film
1,but this movie has no redeeming qualities,but the movie is a complete mess
1,incidentally the movie has a lot of problems but the story is very interesting,incidentally the movie is a bit long and it 's not the type of film
1,that 's the only way you will ever feel you 're watching the movie,that was the only thing that kept me watching and waiting to see what the
1,even though this film was not a complete disaster it was a very good,even though it is not a comedy it is still an excellent film
1,why is the director so stupid,why do n't we see the film
1,it is a movie about a group of people who have a relationship and are married,it 's the kind of movie that you would n't want to miss and you 'll have
1,over the years i have been watching it,over all this movie is n't bad
1,the acting was horrible and i could n't help but laugh,the film is a bit slow moving but it 's a good
1,every time the film opens the screen is a bit of a mess,every time the film opened you would be forgiven for it and then you
1,enough to be a good movie to be honest but,enough the film 's plot is n't that interesting
1,joe don baker is the best actor in,joe 's character has the same problem
1,after the movie i had to go to a movie with the director,after all these years i have seen this film in a theater
1,she 's a little too much of a whore,she is a good actress but she does n't have
1,36 minutes into the movie the viewer is left wondering why he,36 minutes into the movie the viewer gets bored and bored
1,i have seen a few episodes of this series and it is still pretty good but i have,i was expecting a movie about a bunch of people who were fighting a couple of times
1,i have n't read the book but i think the movie,i do n't think that the actors are really good
1,one thing i liked about a movie,one of the best films ever
1,so the film is about the only thing you can think of it,so if you 're going to make a film about this subject it 's
1,eventually he finds out that he is the one,eventually he meets the man and his son
1,the movie has an excellent soundtrack and the acting is great,the film was made for a very long time in the early
1,oh yeah and the ending was a bit cheesy,oh and the last 15 minutes of the movie are
1,the movie has a very nice cast,the film is a bit of an action
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that this was a very bad movie,i have seen a lot of movies and this is one of my favorite
1,however the movie was a lot of fun,however the film is a complete mess
1,his character is a caricature of the film,his character is a caricature of a man who
1,this was a very good movie but it was n't,this is a great film for the whole family
1,supposedly this is a great movie,supposedly it was a great movie for
1,however the film is not about a man and the girl who,however i do n't want to spoil the movie for you
1,keaton 's character is the only one who has a motive for him,keaton and his friends have a very good chemistry with each other
1,one of the best movies ever made,one of the few films where you can
1,in fact it is not a good thing,in fact i think that the film would have
1,that 's the only reason i gave this movie a 2 out of 10,that 's the only thing that makes the film so enjoyable to watch it is
1,sherilyn the film is a complete mess,sherilyn fenn is the most annoying character ever
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i have n't seen the original but still
1,very good movie and i would recommend,very good acting by the leads
1,kansas city is a very enjoyable movie and i recommend it,kansas city is one of the best films i have ever seen
1,now i do n't know if this was supposed to be a comedy,now i have to admit that the movie was very well made
1,after seeing this film you will be wondering whether it was meant to be or not,after a while you can tell the difference between the two films is not a good idea
1,for the first time i was able to watch a few episodes of the series which i had seen in a long time,for those of you who do n't like it and do n't mind the story it 's worth a watch if you 're a
1,jennifer tilly is a great actress and she is very,jennifer tilly plays the part of a young woman
1,i do n't think that this movie would be much better if the director was n't,i was surprised to see that the film had a good cast and it was a very
1,he was a great actor and a good one,he is also a great actor and he 's great
1,on the other hand if you are looking for something that is a good idea to watch a movie that is,on the other hand i do n't like the fact that the film is a bit over an hour long
1,ever since the last scene where she is supposed to look at the same guy i,ever again i was able to see the movie and was amazed by the ending
1,the film is a complete mess,the film is a little slow at
1,an old man in his early twenties is an expert of his own and he,an excellent cast of characters who are given the right amount of screen time
1,animal cruelty is a great film,animal house is a very good horror
1,the movie has a very good cast,the movie is very funny but the movie
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this film has a great cast and a very good
1,another example of how the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager and a,another problem with this film is the fact that it 's a little slow at times
1,regardless of the fact that the movie is,regardless it 's not even that bad
1,sure this movie is a little dated but it 's a good film,sure it is a little bit of a stretch but i think that 's
1,but the film has no plot and the only thing is that the movie does have,but i do n't think it 's a good movie and it does not work
1,it 's a shame that the producers,it 's a very good movie
1,i do n't know if it was the script or the acting,i was n't expecting anything from the movie to be honest
1,like the first film this one is a very good one,like many of the reviewers here said that the movie was a
1,check out the scene where a man who 's a little bit more than just another man,check out the movie 's a great deal of money and a great deal of time
1,technically this film is not as bad as,technically it 's a pretty good movie
1,it 's a shame that the film never made it to the theater,it 's not the worst movie ever made but the acting was pretty good
1,the acting is pretty good but the script is awful the acting is awful and,the movie is not a comedy but it 's a fun movie to watch
1,the film is not a documentary of the period,the acting is very good and the script is very
1,my favorite scene is when he tells a friend of the woman that he is a man,my friend who i saw this movie in my childhood was so scared that i actually laughed out
1,one of the best movies of the past decade,one thing i did n't like about this movie was
1,word of mouth is not a film for the masses who,word of advice is the first time you see this
1,when he is in the movie he is not in the same,when i saw it i thought it was a good film
1,unfortunately this movie is not the best one,unfortunately the film is not as polished or as
1,the story line is a little thin but it is n't a good film,the story is about a bunch of young men who go to a remote island
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film,the acting was terrible the story was weak the dialogue was stupid and
1,questions arise in the end and the end is very satisfying,questions are answered and it is a bit too obvious to me
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot at the same time as
1,i was n't really surprised to see this,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i have seen a lot of movies that were so bad they were good but,i have seen the film twice and i have seen a lot of movies
1,it 's a pity that this film,it 's not a good movie
1,the film 's premise is a simple idea for a movie and a lot of the actors have been involved in the making of this movie,the film was shot in the early seventies and was a little too long to be considered as one of the most memorable films of the last
1,gertrude is the best character in the movie,gertrude is not an actress she 's a very
1,the film was a bit of a mess and the,the film was shot in a very cheap way
1,then i saw the trailer on the dvd cover that this movie had the potential to be a movie,then there 's the fact that it is a movie that is not only a vehicle for a few laughs
1,it was a very good movie,it 's just that the movie does
1,he was the only one to die in the end,he 's a little more than a bit stiff
1,and that 's what it is all about,and i think this movie is the most accurate
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen anything like that before,i was expecting a lot of the film but i did n't like
1,i do n't think this movie would have been,i was n't expecting much from the film
1,ok so it 's not as bad,ok the plot is n't bad
1,my favorite scene is when the guy gets his head smashed in the face and then says he 's going to be,my friend who was in the movie and was a fan of the book and was interested to see this film
1,is it the bad acting or the bad acting,is that the same thing as the other movies
1,maria and the rest of the gang are the only one who has,maria is a very good actress and she 's great as always
1,the film is a little slow but the acting is so bad that it makes you feel like,the movie was n't bad at all and the ending is so bad it 's actually funny
1,it 's a shame that the movie is not only a,it 's the story that makes this film so compelling
1,as a matter of fact it 's a very poor,as a result the film is very well done
1,i do n't think it 's a good movie,i have to say that the acting was pretty bad
1,as a result it is n't as good as the first one,as i said earlier the movie is n't as good as the first
1,while the plot is a little thin the characters are n't as developed as the first,while the film is not a comedy it is a very funny and enjoyable movie
1,the film is a very funny one and a good time capsule of,the film was shot in the same location as the first film
1,sometimes the film is n't a total waste of time,sometimes you can see a good director and a director
1,there are some very good moments but it 's not a good one,there 's a lot of action and the usual suspects are the ones who
1,but i do n't want to spoil it for,but it was n't a good movie either
1,while the film is n't as good as it is it 's not a bad movie,while this movie is an excellent film it is still very good to see and it is
1,the film is not a comedy,the film is a little too long
1,she is a great actor and i,she is a very talented actress
1,the film is a little slow and the plot is a little confusing but i think it,the film is a little too long for the story but it is a good movie
1,cue the movie is not a good idea,cue the film as a whole is a very
1,it 's a shame that the film,it 's the same old story
1,you know that it 's a good movie but it is not,you have to wonder how much money was spent on this movie
1,the film has a very nice feel to it and the acting is excellent,the movie is about a man named benjamin who is trying to get a new
1,rex ingram is a very talented actor,rex ingram plays his character very well and
1,or maybe the director 's intention is to create the film with the same amount of atmosphere and atmosphere,or maybe it 's a good idea that the film was n't so bad that it could n't even be
1,and that 's what it 's all,and the ending was so bad
1,after the film was over i had the misfortune to watch the movie again,after seeing the film i can say that it is a great movie
1,also i think that it 's the best movie that,also the movie does not have a happy ending
1,but the movie does have a few funny parts,but i think that it is not that the film
1,the story is a little weak and the characters do n't really seem to have any depth,the film is about a young man who is a teenager and his son who has a heart
1,the acting is good the plot is pretty good and it 's,the movie is very well written and the acting is superb
1,the film is a complete failure,the acting is very good but the
1,tesis i have to say that this is a movie that i can,tesis is that the film is a bit of an action movie
1,nonetheless i think this movie should be,nonetheless it is a good film
1,there 's a lot of action,there is a lot more to this
1,she has the ability to make a film that is so good,she is a very talented woman and is not a very talented actress
1,only to have to be a little too much,only the acting in this movie is good
1,some of the scenes where the camera is shot is very good,some people say that this is the most boring movie i have ever
1,all in all a great movie to,all in all a great movie
1,case of the movie 's title,case of the film 's title is
1,i do n't want to spoil the plot,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,bridget fonda is also very good in her role,bridget fonda is a delight as the woman
1,flynn and his wife and the other two brothers have been married and married to the other in their,flynn 's performance is the only one who has a knack for playing the role of the villain
1,from the very start of the movie you can see the actors and crew,from the beginning of the film you can see the film 's intentions
1,i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie in years but i,i was surprised to see that this movie has been done in many ways
1,in fact the only reason i did not give the movie a score of 2 was because the acting was good,in this movie the characters are not developed in the film as they are in a movie that has a lot to
1,you know that this is a bad thing,you know that it 's a great idea
1,they are all very good actors,they 're not even good enough to
1,he is also in the film,he is not a good actor but
1,a lot of people who have seen this movie and,a lot of people seem to have a problem
1,you 'll have to see this film to believe it,you 'll have to wait till the movie to end you
1,i have n't seen the first two,i was n't expecting a lot
1,now i have to say that the movie is a complete failure,now i have to admit it is a very good film
1,but the film has a lot of problems,but the film is a complete failure
1,i was surprised that it was a long film,i was n't really sure why the movie was made
1,this is a movie about the evils of the war,this movie is a complete waste of time and i do
1,ridiculous plot bad dialogue bad acting bad,ridiculous movie with a few exceptions
1,theatrical version of the classic film noir,theatrical release was a huge disappointment
1,how could you not like it,how did this movie ever end
1,it 's not even worth the time,it 's not even that funny
1,importance is the story of a man who has been living in the past,importance is the story of a young boy who is diagnosed with his family and
1,what a waste of time and talent,what a waste of time and money
1,he is a man who is a man and a liar,he is a very good actor and is one of the few
1,the film is very well made and has a,the film was shot in a time capsule
1,right up there with the original,right now there 's a lot of
1,everybody who has ever been so disgusted with the story is not,everybody else is just a bit too old to be true
1,without a doubt the best movie i 've ever had the misfortune to watch,without the benefit of the doubt i would have given this film an 8 out
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is a complete mess
1,atrocious acting bad script bad direction horrible music,atrocious movie that was made for television and not
1,so if you 're not a fan of the original you 'll love this movie,so if you want a movie to make a point and watch this movie i suggest
1,for me it was just a bad film,for me the best thing about this movie is
1,so the movie was n't that bad either,so what i did n't like was how it
1,stanwyck is a fine actress and i would recommend this movie to anyone,stanwyck 's performance is a bit too stiff but the film is very well
1,featuring the cast the story is a bit too thin but it 's a great movie,featuring the worst acting you can get out of this movie i do n't want to say
1,i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be a movie but i did n't,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still great to see
1,i'm glad i did n't pay to see it,i'm not a big fan of this type of film
1,this movie was a waste of time,this film was a total disaster
1,madonna is a great actress but she is a great actress,madonna 's character is so unlikable that it 's hard to care
1,only the first 15 minutes of this film are really really,only one man in the world is a good guy
1,plus this is a very bad film,plus i think it is the best movie
1,i think the movie 's biggest flaw is the ending,i was n't impressed when the film ended and i could
1,you have to be a bit of,you 'll be glad you did
1,one of the worst movies ever made,one of the most interesting things about this
1,probably one of the worst films i have ever seen,probably the most interesting aspect of this film is that the
1,and i think that 's why this movie was so awful,and it 's not that i do n't like it
1,all the actors are excellent in their roles,all of the characters were very likable
1,a good movie for a sunday afternoon,a lot of the film has a bit
1,a good cast of supporting players,a few years ago i saw this
1,but the film is so bad that it becomes almost laughable,but the real problem with this film is that it is not
1,let me tell you that this is not a bad movie it is not a great movie,let me tell you that the film is very good and it 's the best movie i have
1,doris day and his wife were both very attractive,doris day and michael jackson are the only two characters
1,he 's a good man but he is a little stiff in the role of the young man,he 's the one who is in the movie and he 's not a very good actor
1,the acting was good the script was good,the film is a very good film
1,and that is why i love this movie,and i do n't think that this is the
1,this is the worst film ever made,this is the first movie i have seen
1,like a lot of the other reviewers i know that this movie is,like the previous films this is the best of the two films
1,and the ending is so stupid,and that was a great thing
1,nevertheless i think that this film is a great example,nevertheless this film is a great piece of work
1,there 's a bit of a lot to admire,there are a few moments of humor in the film
1,after seeing the movie i was surprised by the fact that i had to watch it twice,after the movie i was really surprised by the fact that the director was trying to make a
1,i do n't want to give away the story but i think the director and the actors,i was surprised that this was a film that i would have been able to watch
1,i have to admit i was n't expecting a lot of this film but,i have seen a lot of movies and i 've seen this one
1,english subtitles are the only good things about the film,english subtitles were a lot better than this film
1,we are left with a feeling of what is going on and what we,we are left wondering if the director intended a sequel to this film
1,few of the scenes that are supposed to be funny or funny are just plain funny and funny,few of the other reviews have mentioned the film 's title which is the basis for this film
1,the film was a bit slow but i liked it,the film is about a man named sam and his mother
1,i think it 's a great movie,i have seen this movie twice and i
1,one of them is that of a man and,one of the most memorable films ever made
1,although i have n't seen the original version of this film i was very impressed,although the film does n't have much to do with its plot the film does a
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i have n't seen a movie like this
1,i'm not a fan of this kind of thing but this is one of my alltime favorite films,i'm not sure what to expect of this movie but the fact that i was so bored and disappointed
1,but the movie is not so bad it 's good,but the film does n't have to be so much more
1,in the end i was hoping that the film would,in fact the whole movie is a complete mess
1,i have to say that i have seen it several times and still ca n't,i have seen the movie several times and it is still a great movie
1,independent movies have been made in the late 70 's,independent films are not the best of them all
1,until the end of the film the viewer has a sense of humor that is n't really quite funny,until the last 20 minutes or so the film is set in a mansion where a bunch of people go
1,a few years later the two of them were married,a few years later i have a fondness for the film
1,although the story is a bit slow and the ending is not the best part of the movie it is a bit of an exercise in,although i was impressed by the film and the plot i could have done without a good interpretation of what i was going to see
1,normally i would have been able to suspend disbelief for a movie that would be better,normally the story is a bit of a mess but the characters are likable and the actors
1,just as you would expect a lot of people to be in a movie theater,just like the other movies i 've seen this is one hell of a ride and
1,it 's a shame that the director never,it is the best film ever made
1,the story is about a group of young adults who are trying,the story is a little weak but the acting was good
1,i have seen this movie twice and still ca n't wait for the,i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad movie
1,srk 's character is a bit of a jerk and the,srk is a fine actor and he does n't disappoint
1,frantic and boring and not funny,frantic and the movie is not for
1,also i have a soft spot for the movie,also the movie is a bit too long
1,if you 're a fan of horror films and have seen the original you,if you are a fan of the book i suggest you see it
1,i think that this movie was a waste of time and money to make a,i have to wonder what the director was thinking and what was he thinking
1,the movie has a very nice soundtrack and a very nice score,the acting was good and i thought this was a very good film
1,it was a very good movie with a great cast,it is a very good movie and i think that the
1,remember that the director and writer of a movie made a,remember that the director of this film was a genius
1,in the first film he is a young girl who is not the same age as she,in this movie the acting and directing are all very good and the acting is excellent
1,walker 's performance is a bit too wooden,walker 's character is so bad he 's so
1,or maybe the director 's intention is to make a movie with a,or maybe it was the acting that made the movie so bad
1,this is not a movie that is not only a vehicle for the camera,this movie was made by a teenager who was in the military and was a
1,here 's the spoiler it 's just a bad movie that is so bad that it is n't even funny to,here we have an excellent cast that is not in the least of the genre but a very good movie
1,as for the acting i would say that it is a bad movie,as for the rest of the movie it 's just a bunch of kids
1,all the actors are excellent and the film is a real treat,all the characters are so bad they are just plain stupid
1,now the movie is about an evil killer who kills his wife in a,now that 's the only explanation i have to say about the plot
1,too bad the story is n't as good as the,too much of a story to be taken seriously
1,all the actors are excellent and i think the director was,all in all it was a good film to watch
1,there is a lot of violence in the movie and the film is not a complete waste of time,there 's a lot of action and some of the scenes are just as good and the ending is very
1,anyway the movie is n't a good movie and is not worth the time,anyway i do n't think it 's a matter of taste or even a good
1,help is the fact that it is n't the best of its kind and it does n't even,help the film as it does n't really seem as though the director was going for something
1, a few of the other reviews, is a very bad movie

1,were they going to make a sequel,were there any other movies that i had
1,having said that i am a big fan of the original series,having a child and two sons in the same place is one of

1,in fact it 's a shame because the movie is n't really that good and it does not really matter,in this film he is the only person who has a chance to be able to survive and he is not
1,take it to yourself and you 'll be rewarded,take the time to get into the film and you

1,but the real problem is that the film lacks,but the movie is n't a bad one
1,horrendous movie about the evils of war and the fact that,horrendous movie with bad acting bad script and bad acting
1,maybe the movie was made by the same director as the first movie,maybe the director was trying to make a good movie but failed miserably

1,that 's the problem with this film,that 's what makes it so funny
1,or maybe it 's a good idea that it would,or the way they are portrayed in this film
1,a few scenes of a man walking around a table and a few of the,a lot of the scenes are very boring and it 's just not funny
1,the acting is horrible and the story line is so bad it makes you wonder if the director is,the film is about a young woman named seita who is a teenager and is taken to prison

1,can you say that this was one,can you imagine the same person
1,dominic morita is great as the lead and he does a great job,dominic monaghan and michael madsen are the best in this movie but they 're
1,with all the hype surrounding this film i would say that it is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is a film that will appeal to everyone who has seen this movie

1,that 's the only thing i have to say about this film,that 's the only reason i even got the idea that the movie
1,mr bean 's performance was excellent and the film was a great success,mr bean is a good actor but he does not have to be the
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it is a very good movie and a very enjoyable one,the movie was made up of the same type of crap that was in the same year as the texas chainsaw

1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this is a great movie to see for all ages
1,there are a few good moments but they are just not funny,there 's a scene where the two girls are talking about the same
1,i was surprised by the ending,i was surprised to see the film
1,for a movie made in the 70s i thought it was very good but it was n't,for the first time in the life of the young girl who is now a child in her
1,it was a waste of a good idea and good acting,it is not a film to see the director and the actors
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this is a movie that is not just a movie
1,a good movie to have seen the first time and it 's a good movie,a few years later the young girl has been murdered and she is forced to leave
1,this film is a must see for all ages,this film is not for everyone but if you like
1,the film is a bit too long for a long time but it 's not a great movie,the film 's premise was that the director wanted to make a film of a book and that 's
1,about the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it 's a pretty lousy movie,about a half hour into the film i realized that the film was shot entirely in the woods
1,it is a shame that this is a movie that,it is not even the best movie ever made
1,i have to say i have seen a lot of,i do n't know why i watched this movie
1,the film was a waste of time,the story was a little weak but the

1,looking at the film 's flaws i had to,looking like a bad guy in the movie
1,the movie is about a young girl,the film is very well acted
1,and it is a shame that the director has never done a better job of this movie,and the acting was n't bad at all and i did n't even know that it was n't

1,it is a movie that is n't a complete loss and is not a,it 's a shame that it 's not available on vhs or dvd
1,my advice is to stay away from this one,my friend and i rented this movie for 5 cents
1,fantastic movie about a woman who 's,fantastic movie that i would recommend
1,the film is a very funny movie,the film is about two men who have
1,having a good time in my life i was very disappointed,having said that i do n't know what to say
1,limited to the movie 's success it is a very good film and i hope it gets more,limited spoilers ahead the film has a very good cast and the story lines are very good
1,it is a shame that this film was released theatrically,it is the best film of the decade and one of
1,if it 's on the imdb for a good laugh i would suggest you do n't watch it,if you want to see a good movie about a man who is n't a good one and a
1,for me this film has a lot of problems in its storytelling,for a movie made in the early 70s i had to see the
1,by the end of the movie i was really bored,by now we 're not really sure what the point of
1,go watch it if only because it,go see it if you can
1,the film is about a group of young men who are sent to a,the acting is pretty good and the script is a bit too predictable
1,i have to say i was n't impressed,i do n't know what to say about this
1,lord of the rings has some good actors in it and the story is,lord of the rings has a very good story and a great cast
1,like the rest of the film it was a complete waste of time,like i said before i have seen it many times but it is n't
1,the movie is about a man who is a man,the movie is not a complete waste of time
1,despite being a fan of his films i have to say that this movie is not a good film,despite the fact that the film was made by a major studio director and a director and a cinematographer who
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the movie is about a group of people who
1,but it is not a movie that is not a complete disaster,but it was the most memorable and funniest of all time
1,it has the best elements of the,it was a very nice movie
1,she is a very good actress and is the,she was n't even a very good actress
1,but it 's not the best movie,but it was n't that bad
1,funny and funny and a bit scary,funny and funny the movie is a good
1,this movie is one of my favorites,this is the kind of movie that is

1,the movie has a few funny moments in it,the film was very funny and it was a great
1,a lot of the film is about the same,a very good story and a great movie
1,then the film goes on and on,then i saw this movie on the shelf
1,the acting was horrible and the story just plain stupid,the acting was horrible and i was n't sure if this

1,2 a group of friends and their son are invited to the island to,2 the plot is very simple and the movie is a complete mess
1,the film has some very interesting elements,the movie has some good moments but the
1,a lot of the movie is about a group of teens trying to find their way to a small town,a few of these actors and actresses were very good and i think it would make a good movie
1,an excellent example of how to make a movie,an interesting premise to be had in the film is
1,i do n't think i can ever watch it,i was expecting a lot from the movie but the
1,obviously it was n't a good idea for a film to begin but i did n't think it was a bad idea,obviously the director of the original film had a lot of money and the director decided to give it a shot of the

1,of course it was n't the best movie ever made but it 's not the worst,of course the story has been done by a few friends and is not a complete loss

1,he was a little more convincing than his role in the movie,he 's not a bad guy but he does a good job in
1,there 's a lot of good stuff here but there,there are some great scenes and some great performances
1,quite frankly the story was n't as much,quite possibly the best of the lot
1,there is a reason to be a fan of the genre,there was a scene in this movie where the main character is
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the film 's plot is a bit confusing but
1,the acting is very good but the script is not really good enough,the acting is very good and the story is a good one
1,anyway i do n't know what to say,anyway this is a very entertaining movie that is
1,since i have seen this movie i can safely say that i do n't think it is a good film,since the movie is about a man who is a little too much of a feral person in life he is
1,nothing is explained in the film and,nothing really happens in the movie
1,i was surprised that the film was made,i was surprised by the amount of detail that
1,this is a movie that is not only the worst movie i,this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,a lot of people have complained about this movie,a lot of people have commented on this movie as
1,so if you 're looking for something like the first two films you 'll love this one,so i was surprised that the movie was made by a major studio and i think that it
1,and the movie has the same kind of humor,and i was impressed with the acting and the story
1,as the film continues to drag along with a very,as the film goes on the film ends abruptly
1,add to the mix of the main characters and the characters that were n't in any,add a few of the most annoying characters and you have a bunch of characters
1,the movie is not about a man who is trying to find a way out of a normal life,the movie is about a group of people who are searching for a missing treasure and the two of them
1,i'm a huge fan of the original series but i did n't really care for the characters or the plot,i'm a fan of the series and the series of episodes and i liked the show more than the original

1,as a result the movie is very boring,as a result of this the movie has no
1,the movie is about a young boy,the film is a complete mess
1,then the two men are in the car,then the story goes on and on and on
1,if you 're going to have a film with a few twists and turns you 'll find yourself laughing,if you want to see a great movie with good acting and a good story then go ahead
1,more than once it is a very enjoyable film,more importantly the acting was very poor and the plot
1,we are not told to care for the characters because we,we are shown to be an ardent and compassionate individual
1,the film is a complete mess,the film has a very good cast
1,if you 're looking for a good movie that does n't make sense and is a complete waste of time then this is the,if you want to see a movie that is a bit slow paced and not funny then this is the movie for you
1,in this case the movie is not about a man who,in fact i think it is a very accurate film
1,truth is it is n't that much of a surprise to watch,truth is that it 's a movie that will not make you think
1,everyone involved in this movie should have been ashamed of,everyone involved in it is a very bad choice
1,we get the idea of how the film is going to end,we 're not supposed to be a big fan of the genre
1,i was so bored by this movie i was surprised that i had spent the money with,i have seen this movie many times and i have to say i was so disappointed
1,this is a very bad movie,this is one of the most boring
1,for a while the movie is about as much a mystery as the first one,for me the best part of the movie is the scene where the girl is walking
1,we are shown a very different story,we are supposed to be rooting for the
1,there is no reason to watch this film,there are a lot of scenes where the camera
1,i was surprised at the lack of a plot,i do n't know what the point was but it
1,the movie is a bit long and the plot is very simple,the film is not as bad as some of the other reviews but
1,just do n't expect a good plot and you have the movie,just as you would think it was a good idea to make a
1,this film was made for the first time in the us,this is not a film that is so bad you ca n't
1,and i was impressed by the fact that,and that 's not what i thought
1,the film is a complete bore,the acting is pretty good but the
1,nothing is explained and the movie ends with,nothing is a bit of a stretch
1,these are the kind of movies that you should,these were the days of the moviegoing public

1,she 's the only reason why i gave this movie 2 stars,she has a good sense of humor and is not just a bad
1,i have to agree that the movie was a bit of a mess and i did n't care for the character development but,i have never read the book so i can see how many people who know that this movie is a bad movie
1,in this film the main character is a young,in fact it was a little too talky
1,all i can say is that the movie is not bad it 's just a bad movie,all of the characters have their own motivations and the story is a little too weak and predictable
1,visually the film is a very interesting,visually the film was very good
1,rock hudson is the only one who,rock hudson is a great actor
1,note the fact that the movie 's title is,note that it was a very poor film
1,he 's a little stiff and he 's just a little more annoying than the rest of the cast,he is the only one who knows how the movie was going to end and it was n't the worst
1,first of all it is a movie that i,first of all i was n't expecting much
1,on this one the movie has a great score by the legendary ennio morricone,on a technical note i think the director should have been shot in an old
1,a good movie for a rainy day,a very enjoyable film with a very strong
1,watch it if you are a fan of the series and do,watch it for the laughs of the plot and the acting
1,the film is very well directed and acted,the movie is very good and i liked the
1,i do n't want to spoil the plot because i do n't think i have a spoiler but,i have to say that the acting is pretty good and the story line is very good
1,we are supposed to be a bit skeptical about the movie but the story is,we are left wondering if it was the same movie as the first movie
1,the movie is a bit slow but,the movie was a complete failure
1,rachel mcadams was a great actress and she was great in the part,rachel mcadams is excellent as the mother and mother of the family
1,however the movie is not about a man who is a man and he,however i have to admit that i was very disappointed with this movie
1,i do n't think it 's a good movie,i think this is the first film that i have
1,i do n't know why this movie is so bad,i have seen a number of movies in which the actors
1,i have never seen a movie like this in my life that i could n't even sit through this one,i have seen the movie twice and i still do n't know what it was about the movie was so awful
1,i was surprised that the film was n't released in the us in the uk,i do n't want to spoil my life for anyone that has ever watched a film
1,kristen kudrow is excellent here and she is great in her role as the young woman,kristen and her boyfriend are a couple and they are all in love with each other
1,what 's with all these elements in,what a wonderful film it is
1,our heroes are a bunch of people in a small provincial community,our hero and his friends and the other tenants are the only ones
1,i was n't sure if the director was trying to make it a horror film or,i do n't think i have ever seen anything like that in the entire movie
1,despite the fact that it is a movie about the evils of a family life the story is,despite its flaws the film also features an intriguing story that is a real pleasure to watch
1,when he is asked by his friend to help him out of,when i saw the movie i was very impressed with it
1,next to the first half of the movie i was a little skeptical about how the film was shot,next the movie was made up of two parts and a few of them were n't even funny
1,despite being an original film it 's not the same one as in the original,despite the fact that the film is based on one of the most beloved and intriguing
1,a few of them were good,a lot of the film is about
1,i think the director should be ashamed to have seen this one,i was n't really sure what the movie was going to be like
1,there 's a lot of good stuff to be found in this movie,there is no real plot and it 's not even a movie
1,while it does n't work for the rest of the movie it,while the story is not as simple as in the original
1,in fact it was a waste of time,in the first movie we get a very implausible
1,the movie is very good and the acting was excellent,the film is very well directed and the characters are very
1,every time i watch the film it 's not even,every single person has the right amount of fun
1,the movie is a very good movie,the movie has some great moments
1,but the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre and the acting is not as,but i think the director was trying to make a statement about a man in a movie
1,the movie is not a complete waste of time,the acting is good and the plot twists are pretty
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i do not recommend this movie
1,this film is a must see for everyone,this movie is a waste of time
1,if the film is a little slow at least it is not a total disaster,if i had to choose between the two and the characters i could n't help but
1,also the film was shot in the same location as the first,also the movie is a little bit too dark for me
1,on the other hand it is a great movie,on the other hand the movie is a bit slow
1,and i do not know how many people who have,and that 's why the movie is so awful
1,head of a nation is a film that will,head of the north is an entertaining movie
1,still this movie has the best acting i have ever seen,still i think the director was trying too hard and it was
1,while this movie is not a good one it 's not bad it 's just bad,while the film is not as good as the original and it is n't as good as
1,and the film is a bit of a mess and a little too long,and it 's not that the story is n't that interesting to watch
1,oh and the last scene with a woman who is supposed to be a little too old,oh yeah i do n't know how it 's possible to say this movie is bad
1,she 's not the best actress in the world,she 's not a good heroine but she is n't
1,it 's not a bad thing that the movie is not as great as the original,it 's a shame that the producers never got a decent release in the us
1,i was n't sure whether it was a bad film or not but it was good,i do n't want to spoil the movie for you but it is a great story and
1,but i have n't seen it yet,but the real problem was the script was
1,jake 's character was a little more interesting to me than the other,jake 's character is so annoying that he becomes annoying and stupid
1,first of all i do n't know why this movie was made,first of all the movie is not as bad as it is and
1,i do n't know if it was the fact that i saw the movie but i,i have to say that i 've never seen a movie that is so bad
1,i'm a big fan of horror movies,i'm a fan of the series and i
1,what is the purpose of this film,what i got was an interesting story about
1,musical number 2 is an excellent film and i recommend the movie,musical score is also the most important aspect of this film
1,accompanied by the usual hollywood style of the late 70s this film,accompanied by a very bad script and a few good actors
1,it is the story of a young man who has to cope,it 's not a movie that is n't a good movie
1,she is a very attractive and sexy woman,she 's the best character in the film
1,the movie is about a young man who is a little too old,the film is a bit too long for the first half hour
1,the film was a bit of a mess but,the film is a complete waste of time
1,as the film goes along it 's a little slow and boring and it does,as a matter of fact the film has a lot of action in it
1,cole is the only one who is a good person and he is a very good actor,cole 's character is a bit dim and the film is n't as good as some of the
1,this film is a must for all fans of the genre and the,this movie is not for everyone but it is worth a look
1,it 's a very good story,it 's a great film and one
1,at first i did n't know that the film was going for a comedy but i was n't disappointed,at first i thought that this was a very funny movie but i did n't really know what it wanted
1,but i do n't think the movie is,but the story was a complete disaster
1,a very good film that i would recommend to those who love the genre,a lot of the humor was in the film and the acting was pretty bad
1,also i have to say that the movie is very good,also the movie does have its moments in which the characters are
1,a few years later the movie has its charms,a few years later the two men have been in
1,you know that the film is a complete disaster,you have to wonder if the writers had to make
1,the movie is about the power of the human spirit and the consequences,the movie has a great deal of humor but it is not
1,certainly it is the best film i,certainly the movie is worth seeing
1,why do i give this movie a 10,why does n't the director make a movie about
1,as a result the movie is a bit slow but the acting is excellent the direction is superb and the story line is a bit too weak,as a fan of the original series i was delighted to find that this movie has a lot of potential and i think it is the best of
1,i do n't know how it was going to end but it was a little bit of a disappointment,i have to say that the film was a bit slow and i did n't really care for the main
1,also the film was very well made,also the film is a little too slow
1,one thing that i did not understand is why they,one of the best films i 've ever seen
1,really the only one that i can recommend is the fact that the film was shot with an open mind,really the movie is n't even a movie and the actors who do n't really have the talent to do a
1,it 's not a movie that is a little bit too much,it 's a shame that this movie was released in theaters
1,this is one of those movies that has a very strong message to it and it,this movie is one of my favorites to watch and i will always remember it

1,branagh 's direction is a little uneven but,branagh has the best of the best
1,the movie is not as good as the first one it 's not,the film is a bit slow but it is a good film

1,hitchcock 's the film is an adaptation of the,hitchcock 's direction is a bit too high
1,can anyone please stop laughing and say that,can i say that this is a great movie
1,not to mention the fact that he 's in the movie,not that it 's not funny but that 's a lot
1,not to be taken as a film and it 's not a bad thing,not only was it a bad film but it was a good movie
1,monk was the best character ever,monk 's character has a lot more
1,rubin and his wife are in love with the girl and they,rubin is the only one who has a crush on her

1,lawrence is a young girl who has a boyfriend who,lawrence 's character is a caricature of the book
1,rudd 's performance is very poor and the script,rudd is the perfect choice for this movie
1,after the first half hour i thought i 'd throw in some spoilers and the movie was pretty good,after a few minutes of the film we see a bunch of people walking through a crowded hotel building
1,dr hackenstein 's character is a very likable character,dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon

1,anyway i do n't think it 's a bad movie but it is n't a bad movie it 's good,anyway the film is a very interesting and very interesting experience of the period in which the movie is set and
1,5 the story of the film is a bit of a mess but i do n't think that it is a movie that is n't,5 a group of friends who are trapped in the woods in a remote cabin are sent to an island where a couple of people are
1,the acting is good and the plot is a little too convoluted,the movie has an interesting message about life and how it is
1,it is a very good film and a great example,it 's just so bad that it 's funny
1,moreover the film is not as good as,moreover it 's not a good film
1,this is one of the best movies,this is not one of those
1,i do n't think this is the best film ever,i was surprised to see the movie on the imdb
1,i have seen the movie and i have to say that i 've never seen a movie that is so bad that i ca n't even,i do n't think that the movie is a masterpiece of the original but the acting was superb and the story line was very interesting
1,some of the scenes are just plain,some of it is not funny
1,i have n't seen it since i first saw it in a theater and it was a great movie,i do n't think that it 's a bad film and it 's a shame that this movie is n't
1,he has a very small part,he was a great character and i
1,all i can think of it was the music,all in all this was an excellent film and it
1,much of the film is shot in the same location as in the first film,much of this film 's appeal is to be a little over the top
1,it was a good film and i,it 's a very good movie
1,if you 're a fan of the original series and you know that the series,if you 're a fan of the original series you 'll love this one
1,austin duck is a great example of,austin powers is a great actor
1,before i wrap this up i have to say that the film was a bit too long for the majority of the audience,before i watched the movie i was really surprised that i did n't have to watch it to see what it was like
1,unlike the other films i have seen in my life the film is,unlike most films of this period the film is a complete failure
1,the film is a complete failure and the acting is terrible,the film is not about a man who is a man who
1,the film 's plot is a little thin,the movie is a little slow at first but
1,the film is not a documentary about how the world of the world of the revolution is,the film is a bit slow and slow but the ending is a bit ambiguous and the ending
1,nearly every scene in the film was,nearly every character is a stereotype
1,the film was shot on location in new york and the production design,the film is very well done with the exception of the director
1,the story is a bit confusing and the ending is a bit too,the acting is good but the script is n't really that good
1,which brings me to a very positive conclusion that this,which is why i gave this movie a 10
1,it 's not the worst of the bunch but i,it 's not even the worst movie ever made
1,in fact it 's a bit of a stretch of the movie,in the end the only good part of the movie is the ending
1,but the film is a bit of a bore,but i think it 's the best of the three
1,if you 're not a fan of the book i recommend this film,if you want to see a movie that is so bad that you can
1,the acting was terrible and the script was so bad that i could n't even care less about the character,the acting is good the script is a little slow but the story line is so bad and so unbelievable that
1,the acting in this movie is very good,the movie has a very good story line and
1,lol i have to say that this was a very good movie but i,lol the story is a bit of an excuse to follow the plot
1,but it 's still a good movie to watch,but i think that the movie was n't that good
1,you 'll be glad you do,you can tell that the film is
1,the acting and directing was excellent,the movie was made by an american
1,she has a good time and she is n't just a bad,she 's the only one who has a crush on her
1,unless you 're looking for an action flick with lots of action and a few laughs,unless you 're a fan of the original i think you should see this film
1,in the meantime of this movie the viewer is asked to believe that they are,in a sense of the word the film is a complete failure to watch
1,it 's not that it 's a bad movie,it 's not even a movie that the whole family
1,how could you possibly feel that you 're watching a documentary about how a film can be done with,how can you not get the feeling that this is one of the best films of the year
1,but this film is a total mess,but the story was n't that great
1,woman and her boyfriend is the best of them and the two,woman and her friends and the boys are the same people
1,it 's not even that bad,it is a shame that it 's
1,now the story was pretty basic but the acting and the,now the film is a bit too much for me
1,not only did they have a lot of fun making it to the end but they did n't really do anything to make this movie,not only is this the most expensive film in the world but also the fact that it is a movie with a message of what you
1,i do n't understand why the director decided to give this one a try and,i was n't really sure whether the movie was intentional or just plain bad
1,the film 's plot is a bit thin but it is still a great movie,the acting is very good but the story is so bad that i could have written
1,stuck in the middle of a road trip to a local town where a bunch of people have their own problems,stuck in the dark and the dark side of the film is that the movie is a bit too long
1,would n't they have had a clue about the movie,would n't it be that he is not a bad actor
1,will you see that the film is n't a complete failure,will smith is the only person in the film who is a
1,on the other hand if they 're going to make a film about the evils of war they would be a better place to watch,on the other hand if you 're a fan of the series watch the original and watch it with a group of friends and you have
1,this is a great movie and i,this movie is a complete mess
1,i have to say this film is a great example of what a film should,i was expecting this movie to be a good movie but it was n't
1,director john frankenheimer has made a great film in which his life is a,director john woo 's direction is the most impressive thing about this film
1,the film is a little slow and boring,the film is a complete waste of time
1,until the very end of the movie you are left wondering why they bothered to go out and get rid,until the final scene of this film i was surprised that the director was able to get it right
1,but it 's not the same,but i think it is the worst
1,the movie is a little too much for a younger crowd,the acting was terrible the directing was worse and the directing was
1,the film has an excellent cast and the actors do n't help either,the acting was good but i found it hard to believe that the director
1,he 's not a very good actor he is a bad actor,he is also a very good guy and a very good actor
1,even though it was n't a good movie i did not think that it was,even if you are a fan of the book it 's a great film
1,the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the plot was so stupid,the film has some good points and it is n't even the story
1,everything is so bad and so boring that you have to wonder why they did,everything in this movie is so bad that it makes it hard to watch
1,of course there is a lot of action,of course there is the obligatory plot twist that
1,john goodman is the most convincing and most likable character of the bunch,john goodman is the only actor in the film who could n't save this
1,two of the main characters are the main villains,two of the most important things in the movie were
1,everyone is so happy with their lives and,everyone else is either good or bad
1,however this movie is a complete waste of time,however i was surprised to find that it had a
1,erin is not a good actress but she is a real talent,erin 's character is a little bit too much for me
1,this is the worst film ever,this is one film you can watch
1,so i have to say i was very,so the movie was a complete mess
1,most of the movie takes place during the,most people are talking about the film
1,this is the first of the three movies i saw,this movie was made in a time when usc is the
1,2 it is a movie that is not worth watching,2 a woman is killed by an accident and then he
1,so if you 're looking for a movie that is n't,so i guess that 's what the film is about
1,it is a very interesting movie and,it 's not a bad film
1,just as you would think it was a little bit of a stretch to watch it again and again it 's a great movie to,just like the rest of the world the film takes place in an abandoned house and the two main characters are all the same
1,i think that 's what it 's a,i was n't sure what to expect
1,only one of them is the same person who was supposed to have a lot of time to be a part of,only a couple that are n't so funny and i think they 're all just trying to get their own right
1,after a while the film is a bit too long,after the movie was over i was really disappointed
1,a lot of the film is set in the middle,a good cast of characters is wasted in the film and
1,well this movie has a lot more to offer but it 's a good movie,well this was a movie that i would n't have seen if i had to give
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie was a complete waste of
1,the film has a lot of good points and a few scenes but it,the movie is a little too long but it 's still worth seeing
1,i was n't expecting the usual plot to be a bit of an,i have n't seen the first two but i still love them
1,thus the film is about a group,thus i do n't know why
1,this is a very good film with,this is a very funny movie
1,shooting a few minutes of the movie and then you have a good movie,shooting a lot of people in the movie but not the least bit of a
1,unlike the first movie i have to admit that this is one,unlike most movies i have seen i 've seen this one
1,i do n't think this is why i,i was surprised to see the movie
1,if you 're looking for a fun movie with a good story this one is for you,if you want to see a film that will make you laugh at the bad acting
1,gary busey is excellent in this film and,gary cooper was excellent as the villain
1,all in all a great movie,all in all it 's a good
1,i'm not going to give away the ending,i'm sure the film is n't a masterpiece
1,but it 's just not enough to save your time and,but the movie is so bad it makes it unwatchable
1,the film was shot in a time capsule and the camera work was so grainy that it,the acting is horrible and it is hard to tell which one is the next one
1,it 's a great movie to watch,it is not that the movie is n't
1,the film is a little slow and the plot is a little confusing,the story is a little weak but it 's not the best movie ever
1,anyone who has ever seen a good film should be advised to watch the movie,anyone who has seen the film knows how to get the money back to the dvd
1,and it is a good film for those with a heart,and that 's not what i would call a movie
1,i was expecting a movie with the same title as i did and,i do not know why i did n't see it at all
1,for the first time in my life i was n't able to see the movie until the end,for those who have seen the movie and have seen it in the first place and the fact that
1,the film is very well done and,the film is a complete bore
1,on the other hand the acting is very good,on a side note the movie is a complete bore
1,cassavetes is a master and a director of the film,cassavetes 's film is a great example of what a good
1,by the way it is a very good movie,by the end of the movie i was n't really
1,ok so i was a little confused when the first movie started,ok so the film was shot at a time when the film was
1,after a few episodes of the series the,after the first hour i was hooked
1,i have seen this movie twice and i can honestly say it was a good movie,i have seen a lot of movies and i have to say that this one is n't
1,i have to say that i was impressed with the acting,i have n't seen this film since i was in a theater
1,it 's not a bad film,it 's a great film and a
1,in fact the only good scene is when the two roommates meet the killer and then,in a nutshell this is the first movie i have seen that i have seen
1,some scenes are so stupid that you can actually see the actors in their roles,some scenes are very funny and the actors are all good but the story is not
1,the film was made in the late 1930 's and early seventies,the film is about as much a documentary as the first film which
1,hopefully it was the same way that they did n't,hopefully i could get a copy of this film
1,the acting is very good but the,the film is a complete mess
1,and it is a shame that the director has never seen a film where the story has been done,and i was so impressed by the film 's portrayal that it is hard to find a good film
1,but the movie is so bad that,but it was not that great
1,in fact the whole thing is just a bunch,in fact the movie is a complete bore
1,the acting in this movie is so bad that,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,i was so impressed by it that it was so boring,i have never been a big fan of the original series but
1,that 's a big problem because it 's,that 's what i got to watch
1,yes the film has some interesting points but it 's not,yes there are some great moments but it 's not
1,this movie is a great movie,this is a movie that is n't
1,it 's a shame that this film,it is a very good movie
1,almost every character is a stereotype who has,almost all of them are very funny
1,in the end the movie is a bit too slow for me,in the end i was hoping that it would be a good film
1,the film 's premise is that of a man who is a loner and his son who has,the acting is pretty poor and i do n't care what the hell the acting is bad
1,i do n't understand what the director was trying to accomplish but i was n't expecting a lot from the story and it was n't even,i have n't seen a movie that is so bad that i actually felt compelled to see this one at least once it was released
1,so the story is about a young girl named caroline who is married with a woman who is married to a woman who is,so if you are a fan of hers and have seen a lot of movies then i recommend that you 're missing something
1,but i do n't think it is,but it 's a great movie
1,del toro 's acting is excellent and i have seen him in a,del jovi 's character is a caricature of the character 's personality
1,the acting is pretty good and the script is pretty good,the movie is a bit slow moving but it 's still a
1,i have seen this movie twice and i am still stunned,i have seen it many times and i still laugh at the
1,these two are not very good actors but they are great,these are some of the worst movies i 've ever had the
1,all i know is that i do n't think it was a great film,all of this in the first place and then the movie is over to you
1,a very enjoyable and entertaining film,a very interesting film with a strong
1,or the fact that the film is a complete mess of,or is he just trying to get his money back
1,the film is not as bad as the first,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,like i said the story was very good and it was the first time i saw it,like a lot of the movie the characters are all very likable and the story is well done
1,even though it has been said that the film is a,even the acting was terrible and the acting was awful
1,not only is he a bad actor he also is a very talented actor who is n't a bad guy and is not the worst character he has,not to say that it is not a good film but it does n't have a very good plot and it 's just a little too long
1,most of the film takes place in the same location,most of the actors are not very good either
1,i was surprised to find that this was one of those films that i,i was n't impressed when i saw this movie on the big screen
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have,i was expecting this to be a good movie
1,i do n't know what to do but the film is a complete,i have seen this film twice and it 's a great film
1,but the movie is n't as good as it should,but the film is a bit slow and boring
1,the movie is a little over the top but it is n't that bad either,the movie is very good and is n't really a bad movie it is a very
1,there are some very funny moments in this movie,there 's a lot of action and a lot of
1,you can tell the director was trying to get his,you 'll see the movie coming out of nowhere
1,in the end it 's a good thing to say,in this case the director and writer have been in the
1,this movie is so bad it 's good,this film was a waste of time and money
1,it 's a pity because it was a bit too long and i think the,it 's a great story and it has to be seen to be believed
1,as a matter of fact it 's a shame,as for the film it 's a very good film
1,lisa is a very good actress who is a real actress and she 's very good as the mother,lisa 's father is a young man who lives in the city and is in love with her
1,instead of the usual clichs that are the same type of jokes the movie is just a bunch of bad guys,instead of being a big fat guy he just looks like a cross between the real world and his entourage
1,for the rest of the movie there are some very interesting moments,for a long time i have seen a lot of movies in my
1,i think this film is a masterpiece of the genre,i do n't know if i can get my hands on
1,these two men are also very good and the film is a real treat,these two films are not the best of the genre but this one is a
1,partly the film is a bit too long,partly the story is a little bit farfetched
1,while i do n't know if this is a comedy it 's a very bad film,while this movie does n't have much of an explanation for the characters it 's a complete
1,yes it 's not that great but it 's still a good movie,yes i know it is the best movie i 've seen in years but
1,meanwhile the movie begins with the arrival of two men,meanwhile a woman is murdered by the evil dead
1,they were n't all that bad,they 're the same characters who were
1,we are supposed to believe that a bunch of,we have a very interesting and interesting film
1,i do n't think that the director intended to be a film,i do n't know why i did n't watch it because it was
1,it was a very funny show that i would watch,it is n't that bad but it was n't
1,i was surprised by this film,i have seen it many times
1,bravery is not a bad thing,bravery is one of those films that
1,but it 's a good idea,but the film 's biggest flaw is
1,the film 's plot is a little weak,the movie has a great cast including the actors
1,this movie is a complete waste of my time,this film is a must see for all ages and
1,some of the scenes are so bad it is,some of these scenes are just too long
1,a good cast is wasted on a few scenes that are n't worth the,a few years later the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,the story is about a bunch of people who are trapped in a house and are forced to work together in a haunted mansion,the film has a great soundtrack and a nice soundtrack that 's a nice surprise but i think it 's the worst film i have
1,the film is about a young boy named kenny who is a little boy who,the film is about a group of people who are trapped in the woods
1,spoiler alert the film 's plot summary was n't that bad but the,spoiler ahead the plot is very thin and the acting was bad
1,it is not a good movie but it is a great movie,it 's a pity because it 's not a bad movie but it
1,the film is not about the war of,the movie is a bit too long
1,it 's not even that good and is n't a good movie,it is not even a good movie but i think it is the
1,audience applause is the only thing that is n't bad,audience members who have seen the film will probably be bored
1,for those who like the original and are the only thing you can,for the rest of the movie it is a very good film
1,certainly the worst movie i have ever seen,certainly not as bad as the first two
1,calling it a horror movie is a mystery,calling it a movie is a mystery
1,sure it is the best film i 've seen this year,sure it was a good idea but it is n't a good
1,he is the most talented actor in the history of,he was a very talented actor in this role
1,randy quaid is the best actor ever,randy quaid is the perfect choice for the
1,honestly it 's a very good film,honestly it does n't matter that the movie
1,if you are looking for something more than just a movie you 'll have to watch this movie,if you 're looking for a good action movie with a good script this one is for you
1,the film 's story is a little too,the film is a very good film
1,charlie brown is the only actor in the movie that,charlie brown is one of the best comedians ever
1,all of this is a very good thing,all in all this film is an enjoyable watch
1,i was so impressed when i heard that it was the best movie i 've ever seen,i have seen this movie twice and i am still waiting till it comes out on dvd and
1,the movie is about a man who has a wife and son who is a man,the movie is a bit of a bore but it does n't have to be that bad
1,i was n't impressed with the story but it 's still a good film,i think it 's a shame that the director did n't make a sequel
1,but it 's a great movie,but the film is a bit too
1,the film is a very good film,the movie is a bit too slow and
1,among other things that were missing was that it was n't really a,among the many things i liked about this film was the acting
1,for those who like the original and the first one i would say this is a good movie,for me the most memorable scene is the scene where the two guys are talking to their friends about
1,i do n't think that it 's a great movie to make a good movie but the acting was good and the story was good,i do n't think that the film is so bad that i ca n't even think of anything else that i have ever said
1,in a way i do n't think that the actors are good enough to be the one who is not in this film,in the meantime of the movie the director and writer have a lot of problems and the film does have some very interesting scenes
1,if you want something a little more exciting than you might want to see it,if you are not a fan of this movie i highly urge you to avoid this
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable and so unbelievable it 's hard to follow,the story is very simple but it 's not that bad it 's just not as good as the
1,this film has a very good story line,this is the best movie of the year and
1,this movie has a very good cast,this is a very bad movie
1,it 's a pity that the film has n't been,it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,but i do n't think it 's a good,but the movie is a bit too long
1,the movie is not a complete waste of time,the film 's plot is so predictable and the acting
1,an interesting and very interesting story of two young lovers who are searching for a missing man,an excellent movie that is worth a watch if you 're a fan of the series
1,mr bean is a very talented actor,mr beetle is a great actor and i
1,i do n't know how it got made,i was so impressed by the film and i
1,i was n't impressed by the film,i have n't read the book and it
1,if you 're looking for a film that is n't a complete waste of film,if you have a choice for a horror movie this one is for you
1,bought a ticket for the next dvd,bought this movie for the rental and you
1,i'm glad i did n't get the chance to watch this movie,i'm a huge fan of the original series and i have to admit
1,just as you would have to be a big fan of the,just as you would have to be a bit too young
1,overall i would rate this movie a,overall it was a great film
1,two of the best actors of the movie are the supporting characters and they all have an,two men are killed by an unseen assailant and they have to fight against the dead
1,overall the film is very good for a rainy day but,overall this movie is a waste of money and time
1,but this movie has a good message,but i do n't think that this is
1,while the film has some flaws the film is also a bit long,while the story is not very original it is still very engaging and it
1,i'm not sure why i watched this movie,i'm not sure what i was going to be
1,having seen the original version of this film i have to admit that the acting was pretty good,having seen a lot of the other movies of this genre i have a feeling that it is the
1,chris farley plays a very good character,chris sarandon plays a character that is n't
1,so if you want to see a really good movie that is good enough to,so the plot is simple and is n't a very good one at all
1,the story is a little weak and it 's,the movie has the best of the three
1,if you want to know about the real life of the real artemisia you 'll be disappointed by the movie,if you have n't already seen the movie you should be sure to find something to do with it
1,she is also a woman who is in love with her,she 's a little more believable than the character of janie
1,also the ending was very predictable and did n't really add anything to the story at,also i have to mention that i did n't have a clue about the story
1,i have never seen a worse movie in my entire life,i was expecting a good story but i did n't care about
1,jeff goldblum plays a young boy who is,jeff goldblum was great in his role
1,the film is about a young woman named seita who lives,the movie is not about the evils of the war
1,after a long time i was a little skeptical about the movie and it seemed that i had to watch this movie to get the full,after the first 15 minutes you are left wondering what happened next and the movie would be a lot more fun if it was n't
1,neither of those movies were so much more than this,neither the movie nor the characters were anything but a complete
1,although it does n't have a happy ending it 's still a great movie to watch for all,although i do n't think the movie is really good it is still a fun and entertaining movie
1,i was n't expecting much from this film,i was so impressed with the story and the
1,to be fair it was a good movie to watch but i would n't have to give it a chance,to be fair i was n't impressed by the movie but i did n't expect much from a movie that is
1,and that 's what it is about,and the acting is n't as good as
1,if you have seen it you 'll know what to expect,if i could get my hands on it i 'd give this
1,i'm not sure if the director intended to be a fan of the original or the first film,i'm not sure whether this movie was meant to be a spoof of the first movie but the acting
1,mixed with the usual clichs of a movie i 've seen a lot of movies that have been,mixed with the usual clichs that were supposed to be a comedy the film is a comedy
1,maybe he should be ashamed to have a better life,maybe the film was shot in a time or location
1,enid and her friends are the only ones who have to deal with their problems and the fact that they are all alone in the same building is very much the same,enid is a very good movie with a great cast and a good story line but the movie is so bad i ca n't even begin to understand how bad the acting was
1,the film was a waste of time for the viewer,the movie is a complete failure to sit through the rest
1,this is a very bad movie,this film is a must for all
1,we 're supposed to be a bit of an observer of the characters but this movie was so bad that it was hard to,we are not sure whether it is the fact that it 's not a comedy or an action movie it 's a drama
1,did they really need to get to the point where they,did anyone notice that the film is a complete mess
1,then the film switches gears and the film becomes tiresome and boring,then there 's a scene where she 's wearing the dress and she
1,the film is a complete mess,the acting was good and it 's
1,and the ending is very abrupt and the,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,they 're just so stupid and so boring that you ca n't help,they are all in a very bad situation that is not funny
1,will smith and his brother have a small time,will smith is in his element as a man who
1,be prepared to be disappointed by the fact that the,be warned this is the worst movie ever made
1,at the end of the movie the only thing that i did n't really like in my life,at the end of the movie there is a sense that it is not a good movie

1,birkut 's performance is a little stiff and his voice is very poor and his voice is dubbed by a,birkut was a good choice for the role of the king but his role was n't really that bad

1,it 's a shame that the director of the movie did not have the money to use it,it was a very funny film and i was impressed with the way the characters were introduced
1,and the movie does n't make any sense,and it 's not even that funny
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the film,i do n't want it ever to be a great film
1,the film was very funny and i think the director was trying to make the movie funny,the story is about two women who are in a relationship together in their lives and each other

1,the movie has a few funny moments,the acting and direction are excellent
1,i was n't expecting a great movie,i do n't know why i did so
1,as i said earlier it was a very good movie,as a result the movie is a complete bore
1,broadway is a great film that is not only a classic film but also a good movie,broadway was the only one who did not have the same name as a movie like this one

1,these two are not the only ones who are willing to go to a party,these guys are the ones who are not the only ones in the film who are
1,i was n't expecting a great movie but this one is so bad,i have to admit that i was a little confused about it but i
1,and the movie was so bad,and i think that 's why the
1,all in all a great film,all the characters are all very good

1,first of all the acting is horrible,first of all i have to say that
1,according to imdb users that i have a problem with the film and,according to the imdb profile the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,another thing that bothered me was when the first one ended up in the middle of the movie,another thing that i did not notice was the fact that this movie was made in a very cheap
1,but i have to disagree with the,but it 's just too bad
1,this movie has a very good story line,this is the first of the four movies i
1,it was a very nice movie,it is a movie about two women
1,the movie has a lot of good things to say,the acting was good but the story was weak
1,what a waste of a film,what is more important about the film
1,his character is so annoying it 's impossible to believe he 's supposed to be the hero or the character he plays,his wife is a young man who lives in a large apartment where his wife is murdered and murdered in a car crash
1,sailor is a very funny movie that is n't,sailor 's wife is a very good film
1,i have to say that i 've seen this movie,i have never seen a movie so professionally done
1,spoilers ahead i do not know what it 's all,spoilers the story was a bit thin and predictable
1,a few years later the young man is still alive and the film ends with him,a few years later i have to admit that the movie has some good points
1,oh yes i know it 's a good movie,oh and the scene where the hero says he was
1,the movie has a very nice soundtrack but the music is also very,the acting was good but the script was n't bad at all
1,she has a very good body and she has the same accent,she 's a good actress and she 's a great actress
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's a very good movie and
1,then there 's a scene where a woman is killed in the woods and is stabbed in the head,then i was a little skeptical when the film came out of the vcr and i did it

1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting is horrible and the plot
1,i have never seen the original so i,i was n't impressed with the story
1,straw gordon is a wonderful actor who,straw sky is an excellent movie
1,slowly the story is told in flashback,slowly the film begins to drag and the
1,in fact i would have preferred to see more of him in,in the end it 's just a bunch of random characters
1,if you want to see a great movie that is a good one to watch and is definitely worth a look,if you are a fan of the series you will probably enjoy this film but it is not worth watching
1,the film 's plot is so thin that it 's difficult for me to find it anywhere,the film is a little too long for the story but it is n't too bad
1,she is not only a little girl but a very human and a very loving person,she is not a great actor but she does n't have to be a good actress to
1,never mind that this is an excellent film,never have i seen such a movie
1,visually the movie is not about the evils of life and the,visually it is a very entertaining film with an excellent cast

1,as a result i was not able to find the remote of this film,as for the film it 's a little slow but the story itself is very
1,spoiler alert the movie has a few moments of comedy but it 's just not enough,spoiler spoilers the story revolves around the main character and his son 's daughter and their son
1,from the beginning of the film the viewer is treated with an explanation of the characters and,from the opening scene to the end of the movie i was expecting a good movie
1,along the way they are arrested and the family is killed,along with the other two the movie is very funny

1,spoon eater is a very good film,spoon droppingly bad is the worst movie ever

1,ace ventura is a very funny movie,ace ventura is an excellent movie
1,one of the best of this series was the one in which the two main characters are in the background,one thing i did n't know about this movie was the fact that the director was trying to be a movie
1,sydney is a very talented director and the film is a perfect example of how a film should be,sydney is an excellent actor who is a good actor but he is a bit of a wimp

1,what is the difference between the two,what 's the point of this film
1,apparently the film 's success is not a good one,apparently there is no real reason why the film was made
1,inspired to the very end of the film,inspired by a few of his own movies this
1,in this case he has to be one of the greatest actors of the silent era,in fact i have seen a lot of bad movies in my time and i have to

1,i have n't seen a movie so bad that i,i was so excited when i saw this film
1,the movie has a few good moments,the film was a bit long

1,after a while i was hooked,after the first half of the film

1,she is a great actress and she,she is not a bad guy
1,the film has a very interesting story and a good story,the film 's plot is about two men who are sent to
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is its lack of originality,but the film does not have a lot of action
1,if you want to see a good movie that has been done with a lot of money and the,if you 're looking for a good movie with a few good action scenes this one 's up
1,they are both funny and funny,they are the ones that have n't

1,spencer tracy is a great actor and he 's very good here,spencer tracy was the most interesting character in the whole movie

1,but the real star of this movie is the fact that the,but it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen
1,secondly the film is not a good movie to be honest but the movie is a good,secondly i was n't sure whether it was the script or the acting or the direction
1,jackie gleason is the perfect villain and he plays a character who is,jackie chan is a good actor but he is a good actor

1,there are a few scenes where the film is a little too long and it is a bit too slow for a movie,there is a scene in which he 's walking around on the beach and he says he 's not going to be a hero
1,in this case the movie 's main focus is on the relationship between the two main characters,in fact the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is that it was a total waste
1,the film has a very good plot but it is not,the acting is pretty good and i have seen some bad acting
1,somehow i found this movie to be a bit,somehow it 's a bit slow and boring

1,perverts are the best thing about this movie,perverts who are n't even bothering with the same
1,i was surprised by this and the fact that it was filmed in a very cheap location,i have to say that i was a little disappointed in the first few minutes and i was
1,i think the movie is very well done,i was expecting a lot of the movie and
1,one of my favourite parts is when the girl is,one of the most beautiful films i ever saw
1,this is one of those movies where you can see it 's,this movie has a great cast and the actors and actresses
1,the movie starts off as a typical thriller,the movie has some great acting and the story
1,after all this was the first time we see a movie that is so bad that,after a while you realize that the movie is a spoof but it is not
1,and it is n't a bad film,and that 's why the movie was so
1,it 's a shame that the film,it is a very good movie
1,and the acting was so bad that i was n't convinced,and the acting was n't as bad as it sounds

1,this movie is so much more than a horror movie it 's very good,this film was made in the late 1950 's when the film was shot in
1,the film was shot in the seventies with no real reason to be made,the film 's plot is very thin and the characters are n't believable enough to
1,despite this the movie is a very entertaining movie,despite the fact that the story is about the same
1,excellent acting and a great script,excellent movie with great performances by all
1,barring the first two films of a certain amount of the film 's characters are introduced to a,barring that the film is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad film
1,not only did he have a good time with the story but he did not seem to have,not to mention the fact that the film was made on the cheap and cheap production values
1,to be fair there is a scene where the hero is talking,to say this movie is bad is the understatement of it
1,a lot of the film 's characters are not very interesting either,a few years later the film 's title is a bit misleading but
1,hearing the story of the characters in,hearing it was n't a movie
1,i do n't want to ruin the movie but the story is a,i do n't know if this is a comedy or a drama
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen,i do n't want to spoil anything

1,i was surprised by how bad it was,i was surprised that this movie did not have
1,and it 's a great story with some,and the ending is a little abrupt
1,so i was expecting a good story and a few laughs,so what if the movie is n't so bad it is n't

1,back in the early 90s the film was shot in a small town in which,back in the day of the jackal he was a teenager and a teenager
1,first off the film is about the same guy who plays a young woman who is a teenager,first of all this movie is n't really about the evils that the nazis have in common
1,to me the best of them was the fact that the director was so obviously trying to make something out of a story and,to be honest i do n't think this movie was meant to be a comedy or a comedy it 's just plain dumb
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and the ending is very satisfying

1,his performance is the best of the bunch,his wife 's death and his wife 's son

1,she 's a little stiff and the story is n't a good one at,she was a very good actor and she was perfect in this movie
1,so i do n't know what the director was doing,so what if they were trying too hard to be cool

1,and i think it 's a shame,and the film is a bit of a
1,we are not supposed to be scared by the fact that it 's a movie about people being killed by zombies,we get a few glimpses of the man who is a very good man who 's a little too old for the
1,the film is a complete failure,the film has a great cast including
1,it is the best thing to come out of hollywood,it 's the kind of movie that makes you laugh at

1,although the film is a bit slow it does n't have the same impact as a typical hollywood movie,although the film was made by a major studio director it 's a very nice film that i think is
1,adding to the mix the film has a great deal of humor,adding the fact that the film does n't have a good cast is
1,so i was n't expecting a good movie but i was disappointed,so if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh
1,i do n't know why this movie is so bad it 's not funny,i do agree that it was the best movie i 've ever seen in my
1,in a way i think it 's a very good movie,in fact this movie is a complete waste of time
1,i think it was a very good movie and i think the reason it was being made was because it was so bad,i think the director should be ashamed to have a film with such a low budget and a budget of about 1000000
1,i have n't seen the first one since the last episode and i think it was,i have n't read the book so i ca n't compare it to the original
1,if you 're not familiar with the original you should n't be disappointed with the movie,if the director was a producer and his editor would be in the movie he would have
1,like a lot of other movies that were made in the late 80s this movie is just too much for them,like the other reviewer mentioned the movie has a few moments but it does not have to be a good movie
1,it 's a very good film and it 's not a,it 's the kind of movie that you should watch
1,hart and the chipmunks and the other kids are,hart 's character is a very unlikable person

1,the film is a very good one with an,the film has a lot of good moments

1,the movie is a little bit boring,the movie has a lot of action and
1,what 's the deal with that,what i liked the most about this

1,i was surprised to see that the film has a few good scenes and the,i have to say that i was very disappointed in the first two seasons
1,fatty is a great actress and a great actress,fatty 's character is a caricature of his own
1,since it 's all been done before it is a little bit too long,since the film is set in the future the story is very similar to the
1,that 's what it 's all about,that is a shame because the film is
1,for me it 's a movie with all the actors and actresses,for the record i think the director should have had a bigger budget
1,as a matter of fact i was not surprised at the fact that this film,as a result the film was very much a little slow and slow moving
1,to make matters worse the acting and direction were pretty bad,to be fair i was n't impressed by the movie
1,just like the other reviewers i have n't seen it since i,just like the other reviewer i have a feeling of disgust
1,what i liked most about it was that it had to be,what a shame that i had n't seen the first film

1,the story is about the lives of two people in the,the acting is horrible and the script is so bad
1,this movie is not for everyone,this movie is one big disappointment
1,also the film is a little over the top and the film 's ending is too predictable,also a lot of scenes where the characters are talking and talking at each other and then the
1,the film 's main flaw is that it is not the same as the,the acting is horrible the plot is stupid and the acting is worse
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies but this movie is not one of,i have seen it several dozen times and it 's one of the funniest
1,i was surprised that this was n't even nominated for best picture,i have to admit i was n't impressed with this movie because it
1,that is why i gave it a 3,that 's what makes this film so good
1,philip seymour hoffman is great as the young man who has the ability to take his wife and children,philip seymour hoffman plays the part he is in this film and it 's not even that bad

1,i do n't think that the director was aiming for the audience to care about the characters and the story was not fleshed out by,i was surprised by how many people who have commented on this film and the other comments about this movie are not that good
1,this is a film that will be remembered as,this film is a must see for everyone
1,basically it 's a movie of a movie,basically this is the kind of movie that i
1,the movie is a bit slow and slow paced but it 's a bit too long,the movie has a few funny parts and some of them are hilarious but the movie is
1,yes it 's a bit of a stretch for a horror film but the movie is a bit long and dull,yes i know that the director was a genius of the original but i think it 's not that bad
1,yes the film is a bit slow moving but that is n't enough to save the film from being a total,yes i do n't think that the director was trying to make a statement about a movie or the actors

1,in fact the whole thing was just plain stupid,in the end i was a little confused at first

1,the story is about a young man who is sent to prison to investigate his father 's murder,the acting is pretty good but the script was so bad that you could n't even think that any
1,the acting is horrible and the acting is worse than the rest of the,the film was made with a handheld camera and a lot of it
1,however the movie is very good,however i have to say that i
1,however it is not a good film,however i have seen the movie several times
1,i do n't know how this film could have been,i was surprised at how bad this film was
1,it 's not a good idea,it 's a shame that such a
1,i do n't think that the film is really bad and it 's not a great movie,i was surprised by how much of it was made to make the film seem a bit long
1,apart from the fact that i have a soft spot for a good film,apart from that the film is a complete waste of time to watch
1,these are not only the few faults but the movie is a very good film,these are not a lot of people in the world who are n't aware of their
1,i have never heard of the movie,i was surprised by this movie but the
1,andy garcia is a good actor and he does n't disappoint as much either as the lead actor,andy garcia plays the role of the young man who has been accused of murdering his mother
1,tough to say that it 's a bad movie,tough to say the least i can say about a
1,like the first film the acting is pretty good,like a lot of the other movies i 've seen
1,the film is a little over a,the acting was n't too bad
1,the film 's main weakness is that there are a lot of problems with this film,the acting is good the story is good and the characters are well developed and it is
1,children of the corn is a movie with,children of the corn and the faculty
1,tony todd plays a man who is a little too reluctant for his own life and is unable to cope with his own personal demons,tony todd 's portrayal of the president of the united states is not as good as his first film but the rest of the cast is
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,this film has a great cast of actors and actresses
1,for those who have n't read the book i think that is why the film is so faithful,for me this is the first movie i 've ever seen that is n't a complete failure
1,most people are n't aware that the movie is a good movie,most of it 's characters are just as good as a bunch of
1,the film is very well done,the movie is very well done
1,what is the deal with this film,what i got to see was the opening
1,it 's just a bad movie,it is n't a movie that will
1,as for the acting the script is pretty poor the acting is bad the story is ridiculous and it does n't,as the film goes on its entirety and the film is not only for the sake of a good director
1,the story of the movie is based on,the movie is not a good movie
1,then i saw the film on tv,then i was n't impressed by the film
1,not that it matters in this film it 's a,not a great film but a very entertaining one
1,the movie is about a group of friends,the film has a very interesting premise
1,in the first movie there is a scene where a young woman,in this case the director is the producer of the book
1,going to the movies of the movie industry the film is very much like a bad movie,going to the film and see the movie and you have the makings of a great director
1,if you 're looking for a film to watch with a bunch of friends,if you are a fan of the genre you 'll probably like it
1,from the opening scene of the film the film is filled with a very nice score and the soundtrack is very good,from the opening shot shot to the end of the movie the viewer realizes that the film is going to be a complete
1,ironic to say i was n't impressed with a film that is so bad it was,ironic to say that i have n't laughed so hard since i 've seen it
1,and the acting is pretty bad,and i do n't think that 's
1,according to the film the director was trying to cram a,according to this film there are some very good scenes
1,and it 's a very good movie that i can remember,and that 's what the film is supposed to be like
1,it is a shame because it 's a shame that the movie did not work for me,it 's not even the kind of movie you should watch and it is definitely a good movie
1,nicolas cage is one of my favorites,nicolas roeg 's direction is a bit too
1,obviously the movie was shot in a studio,obviously the director has a different agenda
1,not only was it not funny it was just plain bad,not only is this movie so bad it 's good but it
1,then the story goes along with the characters and the actors and the actors,then there 's the scene where she and his mother are talking about the same
1,the movie is about the power of the human race and it 's not that it is n't a very good film,the film has a very good plot line and the actors are good but they do n't have much of a chance to
1,however i was n't expecting too much from this movie and it was n't as good,however i have to admit i am glad that i have n't read the book
1,as for the film it 's a bit too long and i do n't want to spoil it,as for the rest of the cast it is a bit of a stretch to see this
1,i have seen this movie several times and have seen it countless times,i have to admit that i have never seen a more talented actor in
1,he 's a great director but he 's just not a good guy,he 's a very nice guy and i have n't seen a film that
1,i do n't think it was the fault of the movie,i was expecting the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,the film has a very good story line and the characters and their characters,the movie is a bit slow but the ending is a bit too abrupt to
1,the movie has a few funny moments and a few laughs but the overall feel of the movie is so bad it 's,the story is simple enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and the characters are all likable and believable
1,the film is a little slow and boring,the film is very well made and is not
1,the film was a bit slow but i was surprised at how much,the film is very slow but it is still a great movie
1,they are both very funny and funny,they are not even close to being a
1,what 's with the characters and the plot,what is the deal with the character
1,if you 're a diehard collector of the genre you will love this movie,if the movie had been made to have been a little more interesting to me
1,on the whole this film is a complete bore,on the other hand i would like to see the
1,i have seen this film twice and i have never been a,i do not know why i have n't seen this movie
1,it 's not a good film but it is n't a bad one,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on vhs
1,either way it was a waste of money and talent,either way it was a great movie for me to see
1,we get to see a lot of people who are n't in the movie,we get to see the movie and we are treated to a lot of the
1,the film is a bit slow moving,the film is a complete mess
1,actually the film is a very good film,actually the movie was n't bad enough but it
1,the acting was good the directing was good the directing was good the costumes,the acting was n't bad either but the story itself was n't bad
1,so what i got was that it was a good film,so the movie is n't a complete mess but the fact that
1,if you want to see a good movie with a good story good acting great directing and a good story this is the film for,if you 're a fan of horror movies and want to see something like this one i strongly recommend you watch the first two
1,but the real reason why i gave the,but this is a very poor movie
1,the film is about two women who have a relationship together,the film was made in the us in the us
1,also it was n't a good idea to make a sequel,also the film is very funny in its own way
1,with the possible exception of the film 's title it is a film that has been made commercially,with a few exceptions in the film the acting is pretty good but the script and direction is so
1,many of the other actors are very good especially the ones who are in the film as they are the ones in which the story is set up,many of the scenes in the movie were so poorly made i could n't help but feel embarrassed to watch them all i did not care for the characters
1,you can tell that it is n't a movie but,you can see that this is an important film
1,we 're not sure whether the film is going to be a spoof of the first film or the original,we have a lot to think about the movie 's plot but the acting is so bad it makes you wonder
1,one of the worst films ever made,one of the best films i have seen
1,although i have n't seen the film in a long time the,although this movie has a good cast the actors are great
1,they 're not even close to the original,they are all very good and have a lot
1,her performance was so good that i was,her performance is a joy to watch
1,it 's a great story and it 's the best thing,it is a shame that the film never gets better
1,but it 's still a fun movie to watch,but the real reason for this film was the acting
1,ok so i was n't expecting a,ok the plot is pretty basic
1,in this one the movie is a little too slow for,in the end it 's not even worth the effort
1,i was expecting a lot from the first movie,i was n't expecting much but i was n't impressed
1,john goodman is the most convincing and intelligent character in,john wayne was the best actor in the film
1,this movie is a must see,this movie is not for everyone
1,add to that the fact that it was made in the early 90 's it was not a very good film,add a sense of humor and a dash of humor that is a little too long for the first half
1,but it is also a very interesting story,but this is a film that will not be
1,it 's a great movie to see,it is a movie that will not be
1,some of the scenes in the movie were just plain stupid,some people say that they do n't know what to do
1,so if it is n't for the fact that it is a film about the evils of war the war and the history of war it 's not just a,so if you want to see something that you can appreciate in the end then watch this movie and you will see how much the movie does n't work
1,nonexistent and not even worth watching for the first half of the movie,nonexistent acting and a story that is not even worth mentioning in this film
1,dude is the real world 's greatest athlete,dude i love you but you ca n't do
1,well it was a little bit of a stretch for the viewer,well i have to say i was a bit surprised at how good
1,i do not think that the film would ever be made,i do n't know what to say about this movie but the
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that,i do think that it would make a better movie

1,and it 's not a good movie,and it 's not even funny
1,michelle pfeiffer is the best actress ever to grace the,michelle pfeiffer is the perfect choice for her role
1,surely the best part of the movie is the ending,surely the best thing is that i did n't see the
1,it 's a shame that this movie is so bad,it is a very funny movie and it is definitely one
1,note the fact that the film is not about a group of people who have a very difficult time,note that the only way to make it through the film is to get the girl to sleep
1,all the characters are so stupid that you ca n't really tell if the movie is a good movie,all the characters are all so bad that they just seem to drag out of their mouths and make them
1,the movie is a very funny movie and it is,the movie is about the man being a man
1,if you have a choice of the original you can find a good movie,if you 're looking for a fun movie to watch and watch this one is
1,a few minutes ago i had to sit down and watch a film that is so bad,a few of the scenes are so funny and i laughed at the end of the movie
1,the acting was terrible but the acting,the movie has some good moments
1,finding a way to help him find his wife 's love interest,finding a way to make it into the movie is a good thing
1,of course it is not the best movie ever but it 's a great movie,of course the film does n't have the usual elements that make the first one so
1,this movie is one of the worst of the,this film is a must see for all
1,the acting was horrible and i was surprised that they did n't even bother to make a movie,the story of a young man who is trying to find out what he is and his life and
1,which is the case here with the film,which is the case with the film
1,for those of you that have n't seen,for me it 's a great movie
1,what is the point in this movie,what a shame the movie is n't a
1,but this movie is so awful that it makes it hard to watch,but i think it is the most important thing about this film
1,thank goodness i saw the movie in my,thank god i did n't get it
1,later the film becomes increasingly boring as a whole the action takes place at an abandoned building,later on he is killed by an angry woman who is supposed to be in the house
1,some of the other reviews here have criticized the film as a whole,some of the scenes are pretty funny and i liked the idea
1,the acting and direction are very good and,the film 's premise is the same
1,this film has a very good premise,this is the best movie i have ever
1,man is the epitome of a good movie,man i love the fact that i am not
1,as a matter of fact there are many scenes of the film being shot on the screen,as for the story well i think the movie is a bit too slow for me
1,it 's a shame that this film is only seen on tv,it 's a shame that the movie has a wide distribution to offer
1,that 's a shame because the film is n't a,that was the most interesting part in the movie
1,it 's the story that keeps us watching for,it 's just a bunch of random characters
1,soon the two of them become lovers,soon he finds a way to get rid
1,however i have to agree that it,however it was a great idea
1,besides it is a very funny movie that i would love to see,besides the fact that it 's a movie about a young man who is
1,however i do n't think it is a good movie to watch,however the movie has a lot of good things to say
1,the acting was horrible the story was bad the dialogue was awful,the film has some good points to make this a classic
1,arquette is a young woman who gets her comeuppance and gets a job with a married man,arquette and her two friends are a pair of young lovers who live in an isolated hotel
1,i do not recommend this movie for any fan of either of,i do n't understand why they are n't making a sequel
1,as the movie opens we see that he has a son,as a result it was a very poor movie with the usual
1,strange but i think the movie is just too good to be good,strange and sad is the fact that this film has been released in the
1,but it 's still a good movie,but the film is a bit long and
1,you 'll be able to see the movie,you can tell that the movie was filmed on
1,one of the best movies of the past,one of the most interesting films ever
1,some of the scenes are just plain awful,some of the scenes in this movie are very
1,but the movie is n't bad,but the real reason why i gave
1,judging from the fact that the movie has a lot of potential it has a good cast,judging by a few comments about the film i was surprised that it was n't released
1,fans of the original series will find the film somewhat disappointing,fans of the series should see this one and will probably enjoy
1,the film is about a man who lives,the movie has a very nice cast
1,i have seen it many times in my life and it is a shame that it is n't a sequel to the original,i have n't seen the original but i have n't seen the original version but i have to say that it is a very
1,a few years ago the movie was,a very good and enjoyable movie
1,the film is a bit of a,the film is very well done
1,he 's a good actor but he 's a bad actor,he is a good man and he is the only person who

1,for a while the movie is about the struggle between two men and their,for those who do n't like it you should definitely see this film
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i did n't care,i have n't read the book but i can say that i have
1,i have n't read the novel so i do not think that this,i was n't really expecting the same to be the same movie

1,the acting is horrible and the script is just plain,the film is a complete mess of the film
1,she is a good actress and she 's a great actress,she is the only character that has any sympathy for her

1,it 's not that it 's bad,it 's a shame that the movie did
1,most of the time he is not a hero,most of the time he was in the same place
1,in fact i think that the director was trying,in the end the movie has no meaning
1,essentially this is a very funny movie,essentially it was a movie made with a
1,sidewalks of the lost ark is a movie that will probably be remembered in the us and will be,sidewalks of new york city is a movie that is not only a comedy but also a comedy
1,i do not think i can see the point of this movie,i think that the film was a great success to watch
1,the film is very well made and is very well,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,and the film has a lot to be desired,and the movie is a little too long

1,the acting in this movie was horrible the plot was horrible the characters are boring,the film is a bit slow moving and the story is n't very interesting
1,which is a shame because the story is so bad that it,which is why i gave it a 7 out of 10
1,this movie has no real reason to make it out for the viewer,this film is not only for the diehard fans of the original
1,it was a great movie for the time,it is the story of a young man who
1,before i start to watch the show i can see the point of the movie,before the movie is over the top is a very funny and funny comedy
1,her performance is very good and the film does have a nice touch,her character is not so much as she seems to have the ability to
1,it 's a very bad movie,it 's a great movie and i
1,poor editing by the actors and a few of them,poor acting and a plot that is not funny
1,the film is a complete waste of,the film is a complete failure

1,this film was a total disappointment,this film was made in the early
1,in the end it is a very good movie,in the end i felt like i was watching the
1,at the end of the film the viewer,at least it 's a good movie
1,it was a very good movie and i liked it,it is a very simple and very funny film and a
1,this movie has no redeeming qualities,this is the first film i have
1,this is one of the worst movies of the 90 's and i do n't think that it is a waste of time,this is one of my favorite movies and i think the director is trying to get a message from the audience in the film
1,overall the acting is pretty good but i,overall it is a very good movie
1,in this movie it 's not that it was supposed to be a comedy but instead a comedy,in fact the whole movie was just a bunch of random kids and a bunch of random teenagers
1,andress and dunne are the only characters who can be identified in a very believable way,andress is a great actor who has a great talent for playing a character that he is
1,the film is very well done,the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie was a complete waste of time and money,the film 's plot is so predictable that it becomes laughable
1,porno is the only thing that makes it worth watching for the fact that the characters,porno movies are the most expensive of all time and this is one of them
1,there are many scenes that have nothing to do with the plot,there 's no need to be a movie maker or director
1,so what do i know about it,so if it was n't for the fact
1,the film is a complete waste of,the film is very well done
1,the acting is horrible and the story is just,the acting is good the writing is good
1,even though the movie is n't a total disaster it 's still a very enjoyable movie,even though the film is not a complete waste of time and money it is a must
1,the film is a bit too long for the viewer but it 's still worth seeing,the film was shot in the early 1980s in the late 1950 's and early 90 's
1,it 's not a great movie it is not as bad as the first but it 's still,it 's just a little too much for the story and it 's not even worth mentioning
1,the movie has a lot of good acting but it 's not,the film is about a group of people who live in a small
1,by the end of the movie you 'll have to be a,by the time the movie ended i was n't really bored
1,but it 's a shame to see,but it is n't as good
1,the story is very simple and the characters are,the film is a complete failure to watch
1,for the first time in the movie i was looking for the next film,for me this was a great piece of work and i was very excited to
1,it is a shame because it 's not the worst film,it is n't a good movie but it 's not
1,this is a very good movie,this is a great example of how

1,the acting is horrible the script is awful the acting is awful the plot just,the movie is not a complete disaster but it is a very good movie
1,take a look at the way the characters interact,take the time to see the movie and it is
1,this is the first movie i ever saw,this is one of the worst horror films i
1,contrasts the story of the main character in an interesting situation with the story of a young man named ernesto who is,contrasts with a very good cast and an intriguing plot line this is the first movie to get the deserved credit
1,and that 's why i did n't get,and it 's not a good movie
1,everyone in this film is just plain,everyone else is just a stereotype
1,instead it is a very boring and boring film that is so bad that it becomes a,instead of being a little bit of a good idea it was n't a bad movie
1,and the ending is so bad that it 's actually,and the movie is a bit over the top
1,if you are looking for a film that has nothing to do with the original then this is the one for,if you want to see a good movie that is n't really a bad movie it 's not for you
1,the film is a bit of an insult but the movie is n't a complete waste of time,the movie has a lot of action and it has the best acting of a movie in a long
1,den is a very beautiful film,den and his men are a bunch
1,although i do n't think that it 's a real movie it 's a great family film that,although this film is a bit dated it 's a bit too long for its own good

1,when he gets the girl he wants him dead,when you see the film you 're left feeling cheated
1,some of the scenes are just plain stupid,some people say this is a great movie
1,why is it that this is a movie,why do they have to be so damn bad
1,worse yet the worst of this film is the fact that it is,worse than that of a tv movie it 's not that good
1,there 's no reason to see the movie,there are some funny moments but the movie is
1,i do n't understand why this movie is n't even,i do n't know what to say about it
1,quebec is a very good show and is a great show for everyone involved,quebec 's first feature length is the best and funniest film i 've seen in
1,keira knightley was the best in her performance,keira knightley is a great actress and i love
1,yet the movie does n't have much to offer,yet the movie is not a complete disaster
1,this is the kind of film you would want to watch,this film was made in the early 1930 's when it was
1,i have to admit that i have to say the acting in this movie was excellent,i have to admit that the movie was very good and it had the same effect as
1,and i do not believe it,and it 's a good thing to
1,a very funny film that is n't just a comedy it 's a very good one,a few years later the film 's success is to be a bit of a stretch of
1,stiller 's performance is so bad that i ca n't help but,stiller is a good actor but his role is very good
1,some of the acting was good but the story was so,some of the scenes are just a little bit slow
1,the acting is very good and the acting is good,the movie was a waste of a good idea and good

1,overall the film was a little disappointing,overall the film is a bit too slow
1,a lot of things happen in the film,a lot of things i liked about this film
1,having said that the movie is not about the evils of the human condition,having seen the first movie i was n't expecting anything more from it

1,this is the worst movie i have ever,this film is not a good movie
1,also the film 's climax of the film,also the film is a little slow
1,or maybe it 's just that i am a huge fan of the series but i do have a problem with,or maybe it is the director 's intent that the movie is so bad it makes it hard to follow
1,in the end it 's a great show for the whole family,in a way i do n't know what to do with this movie
1,nearly every scene in the film is a complete joke and the acting is awful,nearly all of the other characters were so stupid that they were so unlikable
1,even the music is not as good as the first,even when it is not that good it 's not a

1,she is the one who is n't,she is a very good actress
1,i do n't think that the director intended to make the story a good one,i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be in a movie but i was pleasantly
1,for the record i think this movie was very good and it had some nice twists,for me the only reason to watch the movie is the acting of the two leads
1,but this is the only film i have seen that i have ever walked out of,but the real reason i did not give this movie 1 star is because of the acting
1,another thing is that it is a bit too long,another thing is the acting is so bad it makes you
1,minnie 's character is a caricature of the film,minnie driver is one of my favorite movies
1,besides the fact that it was n't made at all and was the first film to,besides the plot is a bit thin and the story is not very well written
1,it 's just that a film is not going to be made,it is a shame the movie never made it to theaters

1,basically it 's not a good film as it has a very,basically the movie does not have to be a good movie
1,filmed in black and white it is a movie that will make you feel like it is set,filmed in a very small town in the early 1980s this film is a very good film
1,there was also an underlying element of the movie which,there 's a lot of action in this movie
1,when i saw the trailer i knew it was going to be a bad,when i first saw the movie the audience was laughing at the movie

1,i have n't read the novel but it is a great movie that you,i was expecting something more than a waste of my time and money
1,a good example of a good movie,a lot of people seem to have a
1,beautifully photographed and directed by john carpenter,beautifully photographed in the same location and a
1,the acting was good and i was surprised at how bad,the film has a great deal of action and suspense
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film is a very good one
1,if you are a fan of the series this movie is a must see,if you are a fan of the series this is one of the best
1,thus the film has a great soundtrack and,thus the film is a complete mess
1,the film is a very interesting and moving,the film is a very funny one
1,not a good movie but not as good as other movies,not only was the acting terrible but the script and the script
1,ok i 've seen the first two movies and this is a great one,ok i know that 's what i was looking for but i found it to
1,to be honest i was n't impressed by the movie,to make matters worse the movie is just boring
1,yes the movie is a little slow but it 's not,yes i know it 's not a movie for everyone but i
1,for me the best part was when the movie was released,for me the only redeeming feature of the film is the fact
1,we have to be a fan of this movie,we are shown to be a little more concerned that
1,vincent cassel plays the lead character and the movie is a bit,vincent cassel is the only actor who can save this one
1,i was n't impressed when the film ended abruptly,i do n't understand why people have n't seen it

1,as a result the story is a little too thin,as for the film 's message the film is a bit
1,you 'll have to see it to,you have to see the movie
1,if you want to watch something good with the idea of a good movie go ahead and check this movie out,if you want to see a movie about the evils of the vietnam war and its political message then this film will
1,the film is a very good film,the movie is a complete mess
1,only a few scenes are a bit contrived,only a small percentage of people would be willing
1,although i was n't expecting much from the movie it was a pretty good movie,although the story is not as simple as the first one it 's not a bad
