0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

1,sadly this is a film for the fans of all those who have seen them and have not seen the film or read the book and do n't,sadly the script does n't seem to have developed a purpose and the characters are so unlikable that you ca n't help but feel sympathy and care
1,the plot is n't really that interesting but there 's enough tension to keep you watching,the film is a very very very bad movie that 's not even worth renting the dvd
1,sigh the movie is very funny,sigh i am very impressed with the
1,he had a great deal of humor to show,he is an extremely talented actor and is very good
1,this show is the best show in the series,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,instead they get a few seconds of a story that could 've been better,instead it shows what a great artist he is in the movie business
1,i have never been so disgusted by it,i do not know how to do it
1,he was a bit confused and he had his own agenda with his family,he is a master actor of a film he is a master of the industry

1,come out of nowhere the film is so bad that it actually makes the viewer feel uneasy,come on you do n't have to be a fan to be able to sit in awe to
1,this film is a very good film with great performances by everyone who is a fan of the original movie,this film is a very good film with excellent actors and great supporting roles but this is a very poor movie
1,the film is a bit slow moving but that 's not the point,the film has a very nice score to accompany the mood and the acting
1,stimulated by the fact that the story is not based on the novel,stimulated the movie to get the oscar nomination of the first film
1,sometimes it is the worst movie i 've seen but even worse i have the feeling it 's,sometimes it seems a little too long and the characters in general are n't very likable either
1,city is a film that you can watch and enjoy,city of god is a film that should be seen by

1,the film is a very good film,the film 's title is a classic of
1,he 's just a little too much to talk about,he is a great actor and a good one
1,my wife and i watched this at the theater when it was first released,my wife and i had to wait for the movie to finally end
1,the acting was horrible all around,the first movie has a great ending
1,he has a great talent for acting,he 's a good man and a very
1,is it an unmitigated waste of time,is n't that what it was a great
1,i think the movie 's best part was when the director took her to a different direction for this kind of movie,i do n't think it is a great movie because of the fact that it is one of the few movies that i
1,the acting is horrible from start to finish,the movie is n't about a man who gets
1,proving that there are some really good actors who have,proving i have been in this movie for years
1,you 'll never forget the film and the ending is the best,you can read the other comments by people who do n't like them
1,some of it was very bad and i did,some of the scenes are really really bad
1,but i have to disagree with the other comment that,but it is not a film of all things
1,worse than the worst movie ever made,worse than this is the fact that the
1,kudos for this movie for its low budget,kudos to director michael cimino for trying the first
1,now it 's a good story for a good story but it never gets better than this,now the plot is n't really that simple and i did n't care for the character development
1,one of my favorite films i 've seen,one of them is in the movie that she
1,the movie 's premise is very interesting,the film is a bit dated
1,and that 's all there is,and the acting is n't very bad
1,yes the movie is n't very good but it has some great performances and some good actors,yes it 's a bit of a bore but i have n't been afraid that the film will
1,and i 've seen some of the movies,and that 's not a bad thing
1,this film is an insult to any movie maker in the world,this movie is a very entertaining movie and a mustsee if you want
1,she looks good but she does a better job of portraying her character and she 's too,she was so bad that i wanted to see her in her underwear in the shower
1,instead of having sex in a bed the movie takes a turn for the worst in the past,instead of watching the show we learn that a lot of people have n't been killed and are n't
1,many of the supporting actors are excellent in this film,many people have said the film is a complete waste of
1,it 's the same story with a couple of subplots,it is a great show and a good one
1,it does n't really matter but there are,it also does not make any difference
1,interestingly enough i had seen it before and i would n't even bother to see this,interestingly i had the privilege of viewing my local video rental for sale as a child and
1,he 's a very good actor but it 's so,he is a very talented actress in the movie
1,this is a pretty bad movie,this is a very bad movie
1,ultimately the script is pretty good,ultimately they have to be a bunch
1,mark ruffalo is perfect for a role that is very touching in his role as the villain,mark hamill is a good actor but he 's not as good in either the role
1,the movie is a little boring and the actors are all pretty bland as well,the film 's only flaw is to have a little more of a plot line
1,casting was a bit stiff but the story is not too complicated,casting is also great as the two leads and a couple of memorable
1,imagine this movie for yourself and i,imagine what it 's all about
1,and it 's the only thing you can see in movies and the ones in the first place,and i do n't know what i was talking about because i was in for a big disappointment
1,i was a little skeptical about how bad the story of a character being played,i would have loved to have seen more of the characters in the film
1,overall it 's an enjoyable little movie,overall though i have to give it a
1,dennis hopper is the star of the show,dennis quaid plays a very complex character
1,i do n't care what happens next,i think this should be a classic film
1,i would love to see this in the top 50 of all time list,i have been in for two months so that i can watch this movie over
1,overall the film works very well,overall it was not a total waste
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie does n't have that same appeal to it,i'm a fan of movies that are made by people who have not had a chance to see this movie
1,he 's not just a normal man he 's still a good guy but,he has a lot more to say about this film than he should
1,the story line is a little too convoluted but the script,the only thing missing was the use of the soundtrack
1,this movie is just a bad movie,this movie is not worth renting on my
1,it has a good story line and some wonderful characters,it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
1,most of these people have been so disgusted by it and i do not know how much they do n't have a good time making it,most of these were n't the ones who were trying to do a little research to be funny but it was not the way to make it
1,it 's a very nice movie,it is a great movie and one
1,i 've heard that the movie is not going to be a success,i was hoping for some sort of closure to the film but i was
1,cut off to a few seconds before the end of the,cut to the dvd extras and extras of this movie
1,finally a man has a gun and he,finally the movie ends with a twist
1,mighty 'donnell was a great actor,mighty peking man was a really cool
1,normally i think they are a bit of a stretch for the eyes of this movie but it does n't,normally the acting was n't as bad as in the first part but it was a very good movie
1,i would love to know more about the characters but if i have the option they are still trying to make the,i 've heard that this was a movie that had to be made by amateurs but that did n't make sense
1,when it came to the first one it was a good idea but that 's just a few of the reasons why,when i saw the movie the first time i had heard about it and found my own copy of the movie
1,just because the film is a good movie,just like in my case of that
1,implausible to say the least the ending is predictable and the film,implausible and predictable with a bit of the same old stuff
1,after the movie 's opening shot the film shifts gears into a series of events and a couple of,after a few episodes of that season of season one i thought that was one of the best
1,the story line is so bad that even a movie like that should have been,the story is very simple and i was expecting something more from a movie
1,much of this is due to the lack of imagination,much of his movies have n't been done before
1,really the best of the movie however is that it was made in 1995,really it is not as bad as the first movie but the one with a
1,if you are a fan of the first movie you should check this one out because there are so many good movies out there,if you like watching a movie about a bunch of friends who are trapped in a world where people do n't know what they 're
1,i saw the first episode on pbs and this movie was very funny,i am not sure if it was made by a junior or b school
1,the acting was n't very bad,the film is not as good as
1,as for the movie i was very impressed by the,as i said before the plot is very predictable
1,the only good thing about the film is the acting and,the acting ranges from good to mediocre to downright awful
1,absolutely the best movie i have ever seen,absolutely one of the greatest horror films ever
1,but the movie is just a waste of money and money,but if you are into the whole movie you 'll have a
1,great film with a great cast a solid performance by john cassavetes and,great movie for everyone who has ever been in a military school
1,so the movie is about a family and their,so what is the meaning for this movie
1,all the actors in this movie were very good,all of the actors were very good but the script
1,it 's a shame that it was made in the first place,it 's all a matter of the word for a movie
1,i do n't think the movie would have,i was very excited about the movie
1,i was expecting more than this,i have to say i was impressed
1,spoilers this is a great film with a few laughs and some funny,spoilers ahead there 's a few things to say about this movie
1,so what we have here is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen,so many of them have been given a chance to be the next film they were going
1,this is one of the better films,this movie is just plain awful
1,i 've never read any of the reviews but i have no clue what,i have to admit that i did not have the pleasure of watching this film
1,on the other hand it is not a very good film,on the one hand it 's an enjoyable little movie with a
1,i'm sorry if you do n't know how to get to the point of being a little bit of a letdown but i have to,i'm not a fan of this type of genre but i can forgive it as a whole not for the good of the masses
1,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival,i 've been watching it countless times since i was
1,historically the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence of,historically the movie is not so well done as a tv show
1,overall it was a good movie that had it,overall it 's an excellent and entertaining experience
1,like the first reviewer said that the movie is a great piece of work that 's the reason i give it a 2 out of 10,like in all of the movies he has done it 's time to make it easier to make the mistake of being a great filmmaker
1,the acting is n't bad but the story was terrible and i could n't get the fact that this,the movie does n't even try to go with the book but it is n't the worst either
1,spoiler the only reason i gave it a 1 was because it was a complete waste of time,spoiler alert spoilers the first movie was a bit confusing but the plot was so predictable and so lame
1,so it goes to an old school and a,so what 's the point of this movie
1,the story is about a group of men who decide to go to italy,the acting is good and there are some funny scenes in the movie
1,you do n't have to go to this film to understand how it is going to be so boring,you have the ingredients that were so good that they did n't have to be done with the movie
1,there 's no denying that this is not only a film that the director and cast should have had,there is an interesting reason to give the movie the benefit of the doubt but there was a very good
1,i have a soft spot for this series of movies,i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about it
1,it is a good example of the type of film i have ever seen and i,it 's a shame because there were a few moments that could easily be shortened
1,i have to say that i had to see this film,i was so excited to see this movie on a whim of
1,thanks to the great performance of the young woman the,thanks to the fine supporting cast of supporting actors
1,that said the movie has a great deal of humor and a sense of mystery,that 's what i would have done a great time to do something else
1,in the end the movie is very well written and well acted,in the end i was left wondering where the real sympathies were going
1,here the story unfolds and it does n't matter,here the cast is great and it is difficult to
1,in this episode the film becomes a little bit too,in the first film the character was a stereotype
1,i saw it again recently and it never gets tired of a tv show or tv show,i was n't expecting too much of this movie to be made in that it was a complete
1,one of the funniest scenes ever,one of them is the one who
1,with a great deal of money and good actors and a few decent special effects i was expecting a good movie with great,with a supposed budget of about a dozen times it was so bad it 's actually good and it 's pretty good
1,panels and geeks and the people who are n't,panels and the pendulum of a good script and good
1,samantha morton plays the young girl who is n't the same actress as the first time she plays,samantha foch as the woman is very beautiful as the young woman whose life is too much
1,upon arrival he decides he has to leave a job in the city,upon arriving at the local mall of the city they find out that they
1,on the contrary they are very entertaining and i thought that the acting was good,on the other hand the film is a very interesting portrayal of what the average family
1,i was surprised when i saw a film of this calibre that had me laughing,i saw this film when i had a friend who was in the mood for a
1,a great movie for all ages,a good movie to be seen and
1,i do n't think i can even think of it again,i saw this movie on tv when i was about 6 years
1,i have to wonder why this film was such a flop,i would n't be surprised if i had a good movie
1,the movie was n't really a comedy and the plot was so stupid that,the acting and direction are so bad and the acting is so bad
1,anyone who has seen this movie will probably agree that this movie is a waste of time,anyone who does n't like it will find an extremely annoying and unnecessary story about the war between
1,or the other way the movie is supposed to be,or maybe the film is a little too short
1,please note that the acting is bad,please please let me give it a 10
1,for the rest of us you 'll be bored to death and not just the one you get to like,for example the scene with the giant critter and a little girl getting shot is a little overdone and the movie
1,it 's a very interesting film about a woman who is sent to prison to,it is n't that great at all and the movie is just plain bad
1,while the movie has a few faults it is n't as funny as it sounds and is just a fun movie that is worth seeing,while the film itself does n't make much of an attempt to make it into a movie it 's not a complete waste of time
1,bizarre and sad to see him die at one point he,bizarre is the only thing that is n't quite funny
1,and the whole film is a total downer,and the film is not as good as some
1,a film about the power of forgiveness and the consequences of the human,a movie that i would recommend watching it with the right people
1,the movie has a very strong plot and i do recommend it to those who love a good story,the movie does a pretty good job of showing a little romance between the characters and the actors who were
1,as the film goes on its entirety becomes tedious,as a matter of fact i was n't really expecting
1,the film is a very entertaining and exciting experience,the story itself is about a woman who is engaged
1,the movie is a little long and is not worth seeing and i think the only reason why it is so awesome is the acting,the plot of the story is simple the characters are n't developed enough to develop a relationship between two men but the film is very entertaining
1,on the surface the story of a boy who gets involved in a murder mystery involving an,on this level there is some great action sequences and the action sequences were quite good
1,all of the other members of the group who are n't the same are all over the place,all the characters in the movie are very interesting and there is a lot of action and action that
1,in fact it was n't that good,in a scene where they find an attractive
1,also a good cast and a very good plot,also the scene in the middle where the father was
1,then it 's revealed that he was not only a child of the murdered but the,then the movie is over and they 're all about to be taken with them
1,let 's just say the ending was a bit abrupt but the,let 's not forget the last scene with the main character
1,you can see this coming from a very very young director,you have to be a woman to watch it and you 'll
1,he is a man who loves to love himself,he is also an alcoholic in the film industry
1,however i do have a problem that i would have to disagree with this is a movie that,however i found the acting pretty good and the script was a very entertaining and interesting story
1,why is it the best movie ever made,why did they need to do that
1,routine is one of the best and most memorable scenes that i,routine is a very good movie with a very nice cast
1,as an example of why they would like to think that this was,as a fan of the original i was impressed with the story
1,yet the film is n't as funny as a few others and i think its the worst of it 's kind,yet it was a little too short and for me it was a good idea that it could be made in the
1,sidekicks are the real people who have been the most important,sidekicks have to have a good time to do so
1,i do n't know how to describe the film,i do n't know how to make movies
1,boris karloff and his gang of friends are the ones who have n't,boris karloff is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,the acting was ok and there were some good performances in this movie and it was n't bad but that 's about it,the film also shows the difference between two people in the film and that it is not only a very important thing that they
1,that 's all i can say about this movie,that was not what i expected but it was n't
1,i 've never had a movie about such a terrible and amateurish film as it was with the first,i do n't know why the movie was released on dvd but it is not a complete copy
1,the only reason that i watched it was the score and i was so disappointed,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the actors were so
1,i'm a teenager i love this movie because it,i'm not sure why it is so bad
1,trying to convince her that she 's a bad boy who has n't been,trying to find it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
1,as a whole the film looks cheap and is very boring,as a result of the fact that the film is based on
1,that said if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll enjoy this film,that 's what you would have to say when the film is set in a very
1,i have seen better movies on my ipod and the ones that do n't even have the,i saw this film on the sundance channel and i think it is a good movie
1,for the first time in the series jesse is a very funny and interesting man,for some reason they are both very good looking and have a great body

1,technically the film does n't really have a,technically it was a very good movie
1,i was very impressed with her performance in this movie,i would n't be surprised when the director of his own
1,at first you 're wondering who the culprit is who is going to be the,at first you have a hard time figuring out how to end the movie
1,this movie was a huge disappointment for me,this is the best film ever made
1,ever since i saw it it was so bad i was n't convinced that i was ever watching a film,ever since i have seen this movie i have n't been surprised at the lack of depth of the story
1,coleman 's character is so bad that it,coleman 's performance is also very convincing
1,we do n't know what it is and it is a,we are told to watch this film in a theater
1,even if you 're not a fan of the genre or the series it is not,even if the characters do not work in the movie they do not make sense
1,after the success of the first film i had the pleasure of watching,after seeing the movie it was a very enjoyable and touching film
1,there 's an excellent line between the characters and the movie,there were so many things that happened in life that would make
1,it 's a very bad movie,it 's not so much in the
1,the film is a little slow and not very interesting to follow,the film was directed by the legendary director costagavras but the acting in
1,i'm not even going to give away the plot of this film as the,i'm afraid that it was just the same movie and was n't funny
1,it 's a shame the actors are not given enough screen time and,it 's not a movie that 's supposed to appeal to you
1,well i have to say i am not a big fan of movies and,well i have to admit i was n't a fan of a film
1,but the movie is a complete mess,but i would n't have given this movie
1,it has the same plot and the,it 's a very good film
1,action and action scenes are the main reason why this film does n't work in any way,action is a good thing that is so good in this movie as you can see it for
1,preminger 's film is not as good as a similar adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel but with a lot more depth in each character,preminger 's character is a bit of a caricature as his character was so much better with the character he was supposed to play and
1,being the first of the three to die i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen,being a fan of the original phantasm i have seen a lot of horror films but this one did n't
1,some of the scenes are just so boring that i could n't help but laugh at how they were trying to make the,some of the other reviews have pointed out the ending but i have to say i have never heard of this film
1,meanwhile there is an old man who has the same problem and then,meanwhile the film is a bit slow and slow in the end
1,how could he be able to get a little more of,how can you go to see such a great movie

1,running away from the movie i was a little sceptical,running in the dark with a little girl she was a
1,this movie makes no sense at all,this is the worst movie i have ever
1,blurred the movie was a waste of film,blurred with the most famous film ever made it
1,i saw this film in the theater as one of my favorites,i 've seen a lot of bad movies and there is something worse
1,the film starts off with a bunch of friends trying to escape from the island and the girl begins to get,the only reason i watched this movie was because the movie 's title is n't as bad as it sounds
1,this is a really awful movie that 's not worth a rental,this is a good family movie and that 's a shame because it
1,liza minelli and john wayne are excellent as,liza minelli 's character is a caricature
1,while the film has been done well enough and is n't as bad it 's certainly just a waste of film stock,while this movie was not good it was not a movie to me i 'd say it is the best movie i 've
1,fortunately the film is not a good movie,fortunately i found it to be a rather dull
1,remember that when a film is supposed to be a spoof of what,remember this movie is a remake of the first and the second
1,the first is that the characters themselves are so boring that i ca n't really think of any reason to care less about the characters,the acting is terrible the directing is awful and the special effects are so fake and laughable that it actually makes the film a bit campy
1,she 's an attractive young woman with a heart of gold,she is a good actor who does well to her
1,okay i know that the film would have been a bit more exciting if it had stuck in the book but i do n't know,okay so if you do not believe the movie and you 're looking for a great film i would advise anyone who likes this one

1,like the previous reviewer said that this has a few good points,like many of the comments on this forum i 've read a lot
1,try to avoid it like the plague,try to find something better on screen with
1,daniel daylewis is the only reason why this film is the first movie i have ever walked out on,daniel daylewis is perfect as the villain who plays himself in the film and he is the most convincing actor
1,i was surprised how many movies i saw,i was n't disappointed to say so
1,ummm a movie about how the movie 's creators could be and it,ummm the story is just a bit too thin for the viewer
1,in the meantime the audience is left confused by the,in fact the film has no substance or reason
1,just to show you the truth of the film and the,just as they should have been the one i did
1,that 's all i can say,that is a shame that this show
1,mom 's life is an insult to anyone in her life,mom and son are a bit too much of a societal and
1,however the movie does n't work,however the film also shows the audience
1,that would probably be the same reason to,that is not what this film does
1,i was a big child of the nerds who,i 've never seen such a great cast
1,the film has no direction in the acting,the script is not very original either
1,the only thing that makes this film worth is to see how much i enjoyed to be a teenager and,the acting and direction in this film are so bad it hurts me that a film can be made
1,although the film is a bit slow at times and the pacing of the story is rather contrived it has a,although the film is n't very good the acting is n't bad and there 's even little blood in it
1,yes it was a very good movie and it made it hard to follow,yes i know it was a big budget film but that 's all this movie
1,there is a scene in which the two protagonists meet a man on a train,there is an attempt at a film to be made in the first place
1,the film is a very moving film with a message,the movie is a little bit of a disappointment
1,there are several moments which are funny and funny,there is no real reason why the director is the

1,there was n't a single moment when the main character 's,there 's a very good reason for watching this film
1,good job but it was just a waste of,good movie for everyone involved in making this
1,as a result the film is quite enjoyable as a horror,as for the acting i would n't call it bad
1,if you have n't seen the original you 're going to get it,if i had to give the movie a chance i 'd have been better
1,the film is not even close to a sequel,the story is about the adventures of the two friends
1,all of the actors were very good at the time and the,all the elements are so bad the movie is just boring
1,the film 's only purpose is the fact that there are no real plot holes but the film does not,the film 's plot is simple the characters are likable and the script has a strong and believable ending
1,you have to see the movie to find out what 's wrong with this movie,you have an eightyearold woman in love with a woman who lives in a village and
1,all the characters are believable the situations are engaging,all the other elements are not very interesting
1,some of the actors have a good time but their performances are n't bad the movie looks cheap and the editing is horrible,some parts were so much that you 'd want it in the beginning with a few twists and turns that you can relate to
1,listen to the title song and the song,listen to his music and dance in a very
1,vera and ashley are the same two women who are the only ones who have seen this before and they 're not in the movie,vera morton is excellent as the mother who 's been a little over the top for some time but she 's also not too young
1,the story is not as simple or complex but the story is,the film has a very good plot and very believable characters
1,the first thing they did is the acting,the film is a very good film
1,the film is also notable and a little over the top in its presentation of the first crusade and how,the movie is just so poorly done i ca n't even begin to describe how bad a movie is
1,this is a movie that will make you laugh and will be a lot better than you,this has to be the best and funniest film i have seen in a long time
1,the movie is very good but the acting is bad,the script of the movie is quite interesting the story has
1,the movie has a lot of plot holes,the movie does n't make any sense
1,he is a man living on a farm and he is a,he 's just too much for the role to be believable
1,this movie was n't even funny,this movie is so bad it 's
1,that 's what i thought i saw was the funniest thing,that is why this film is so great to watch
1,the acting and acting of the leads,the first part of the film deals with
1,anyone who has seen it or have had an interest in the history of cinema should have seen it and,anyone who is interested in watching this movie should be aware of it 's a complete waste of time
1,i 've never heard of this movie before,i am surprised that such a talented cast and
1,make it your best film for a long time,make a few changes about the story it is an
1,later the movie is so boring that its actually,later i saw a trailer of this movie
1,he 's a good man but he is very funny as the villain,he has a knack for making the movie a little bit more than just
1,if you want to see a movie about a young woman you will be disappointed,if you want to watch the movie and watch it for what it is a great
1,he is a very funny guy and i think he is a good director,he was also a very good actor who was not in the same league and
1,bad acting bad script and bad dialog,bad acting bad directing bad editing bad music
1,the script is also the same,the only thing to have in the
1,dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon,dr the dragon is an odd and creepy film
1,i would like to think that the director would 've been at the helm of the director 's career and had the film industry removed,i 've read the other comments here but i think it 's a good one to watch as if it were not for the fainthearted
1,it 's just a shame that the movie does,it was n't so bad it was n't
1,in one scene the camera pans off to another dimension in a scene where a character is shot,in the first scene the girl is kidnapped in a hospital and the scene is a little long
1,think the show would be much better,think of a few good ones
1,even though this movie does n't have that many elements it has a plot that could be used to a more straightforward and coherent experience,even the soundtrack was awful the music was annoying the acting was horrible the music was bad the acting was worse than the script and the
1,he has a small role in this movie,he plays the role he is the perfect choice
1,it 's a good thing that the movie did n't end up being a sequel for a movie or even the last movie,it 's not even a movie for everyone and i do n't think the movie is a masterpiece it 's a total waste of
1,and if you want to see something that has some very cool and humorous moments,and it 's so obvious that you 're watching a movie that is actually quite entertaining
1,essentially the film itself is a bit slow,essentially there is a lot of action
1,i was surprised to find that the film is n't a,i would have liked to see a more convincing film
1,unfortunately he 's never been a good director,unfortunately the movie is n't worth the trouble
1,the script was very funny and the acting was great,the acting is good and the plot line is good and
1,i would have thought it would be a good idea to make a,i would n't say that there is no point to these characters
1,he has a great sense of humor and he is a very funny comedian,he has been the smartest person for a long time so this is a very
1,the film is a little dated with the,the film is a very entertaining movie
1,the plot of the movie is that of a serial killer who has no idea what is happening to,the plot twists were so predictable and predictable that it could easily be avoided by any selfrespecting viewer
1,he also does n't know how to get out of his car,he is n't in any way provoke the ability to convey a sense
1,there is no story no point to that,there is a scene of some kind of sexual
1,and the scene when i was supposed to believe that the man would be in,and the scene where the killer was shot is a bit of a joke
1,colbert 's character is a real woman,colbert is not as good as the first
1,scriptwise this movie is a must,scriptwise i do n't think i could
1,some of the jokes that were in the first movie were,some of this movie 's humor is n't that funny
1,this movie could have been a good movie if they had it,this film is a very bad and boring mess and i have nothing
1,the film has a lot more to offer but that does n't matter,the story is not bad and the actors are not bad but not that
1,it is a shame it is never seen,it has a nice touch to it but i
1,will the viewer please tell me the story of an imaginary man,will they survive or die for the rest of the movie
1,in the end the whole thing is a joke,in a way he was n't the first person he
1,in this film it makes a mockery that 's the best part of this movie,in a movie that has a great cast and the actors in the movie are great
1,3 i think the only reason i gave it the score of 1,3 it 's a movie about a young girl from her home
1,if you have n't already seen this movie and have nothing else to do,if i had the opportunity to see it again i would probably be in for
1,and that 's a little too long for me,and i am sure that this movie is not a
1,there is a lot of good acting and the story was great and i did not like the acting but the,there are a few good scenes in this movie and i 'll tell you that the movie is very bad
1,i was really disappointed in the film,i am a bit of a fan and
1,as the movie opens it 's all so boring it 's not worth it,as a movie this is a good example of the genre and it 's not
1,the film is a great piece of work,the only good thing i got out of this
1,this is one of several movies that i 've been able to watch with a handful,this is a film which i highly encourage you to watch over and over again
1,best thing is the soundtrack of the soundtrack and the music which makes it a very memorable film,best of all i have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,in the end he does n't even care if he can do anything,in fact the whole movie is so stupid that it is impossible to get
1,but then again this movie does not have any,but the film is n't a complete success
1,nearly all films are a bunch of,nearly every scene is a joke
1,but the movie has no redeeming qualities,but this is what it means
1,and the film 's climax with the killer is quite funny,and i do not think that this film has any redeeming qualities
1,do n't waste your money on it,do we really need to be able to
1,i would have liked it but it 's not,i saw a sneak preview of the first film and
1,it is a very funny episode that,it 's not that great either
1,well i do n't know what you were,well the movie was n't so bad
1,makes me think that this movie was made in the early 1990s of its genre,makes you want to know more about your own life and what you can do
1,but i ca n't remember any one that 's a bad idea,but it is still a very entertaining film that will appeal to those
1,i was so disappointed with the story,i have no idea who is doing that
1,this movie is a must see for everyone who likes movies like,this was a very good movie with a very good story
1,first of all this is a very boring movie,first let 's talk about the movie it 's not
1,and i do n't think that 's true for anyone,and it is a shame it is n't a sequel as
1,you know you 're watching a movie with all,you 'll see the ending of this movie
1,first let me start off by saying that i love it when a guy is talking about a,first there are several of them in the film that are so much better than the movie
1,this is a very well made movie,this film is not a complete mess
1,the movie was a complete waste by,the story is a simple one
1,but the film is just plain boring,but the fact that i was n't really
1,but the story line is a little thin and it 's a bit,but then again i 've seen all of the other comments here
1,he is an amazing and very talented filmmaker,he 's an actor who does n't seem to
1,taye diggs is the perfect choice for a film which is,taye diggs is a good actor as the lead character
1,jay chou is an interesting choice for this character to play the lead and he,jay leno does a good job but he was n't really in the movie
1,but the film is n't a total failure,but it was still a little disappointing to see
1,really this is not an awful movie at all,really it 's a good movie but it 's very
1,the movie was n't really that bad,the film was shot in the late seventies
1,or why did the filmmakers not make this a movie or to try to make a point that they are n't going to do a movie,or even in one of the other reviews of the film and the fact that the director is n't really the director of the story
1,of course i am not a horror movie buff but i'm afraid that i was n't a,of course i am sure the writers and directors did n't get much of the film
1,the story was very simple and very touching for the whole family,the film was n't as good as a lot of the other films
1,it is one of those movies that you can tell you of that it was n't made in the first place,it is the story of a man who lives in a small apartment in his life his family and friends
1,the first one is a great piece of work with some very memorable moments involving two friends and the one that is a good movie,the only thing i did n't like about this was the fact that it was made in the early 80s in the late seventies
1,wow the movie is so bad,wow it 's not as bad as
1,sharmila tagore gives us the best role of this film and he,sharmila tagore was a bit of a jerk in this movie
1,i do n't know what the people behind the film are trying to tell them about the movie and they do n't have that much of a story and it just is n't,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and it sounded like it was going to be something that i had imagined and i had no idea where i was watching the whole thing
1,while i was a fan of his work he still has been a success and he,while i do not agree with the reviewer it 's not a very good movie
1,while the film was not a masterpiece of its own it still manages to make me laugh,while the plot is a bit farfetched it 's not too bad for the most part
1,logic and acting make this movie a must see film for any person who,logic is a little off the beaten path to be a horror film
1,yeah so what if that 's all that just happened in,yeah i know there is something wrong with that one
1,the film is not very much of a comedy but a few of us can see it,the story is not very well told and it 's just not enough to save it
1,lincoln does the best to give the viewer a chance to see the world 's finest but ultimately it is very close,lincoln has a very small screen presence and is a very convincing character that will never have a chance to become an actress
1,no one else has any redeeming qualities,no i think the director did a great
1,the acting was horrible but i was n't sure where was the plot,the only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is when it comes out on
1,he 's an excellent actor who 's the best actor ever to grace the,he 's not only an action hero but it is an action movie
1,it 's a shame to see this in theaters and in the,it 's like watching a movie that is just too slow
1,synopsis for this movie was the biggest mistake,synopsis of the movie was the same
1,very few films have made the rounds to the,very disappointing and a very very good movie
1,i saw the first episode in the theater and was n't surprised,i would have given the movie the benefit of the doubt
1,you do n't need to be a kid to understand this movie,you have to be a little hard to get through this
1,technically a very enjoyable movie which is n't a good one,technically the film has some redeeming features and i would recommend this
1,find a copy of it and enjoy it,find a copy of the movie and watch that
1,the acting in the film is a little uneven,the film has some interesting moments and is a good
1,okay i do n't think that the director should 've,okay i know this is a low budget film
1,any other movie is a masterpiece,any movie about the holocaust or even
1,dwight yoakam is the real star of this movie and he does well here,dwight frye was a good actor and i have seen him in a movie that
1,he 's just a bit too old to be too young and too old for this,he 's the only one who knows what he does and he 's really funny
1,film is a very good film,film is a very bad film
1,the movie is a bit slow,the film is a real bore
1,all in all if you 're looking,all in all an excellent movie
1,it is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen,it is a shame that the writers of the movie have made
1,the plot is simple the acting is awful and the script is,the script is full of clichs and the acting is awful
1,i'm sorry but i have n't heard a lot of people complain about this show,i'm surprised that the director and writer did n't get the rights to a higher profile
1,although it 's the same movie with some of the same actors in it,although the script was n't very bad it was a little too long
1,now it does n't matter that the movie,now i 've seen a lot worse
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece,i have never seen such a bad film
1,is he a murderer or a liar,is this film supposed to be based on
1,there is an obvious amount of action in the whole movie but the acting is just plain,there is a lot of the usual action scenes and the characters are all very real
1,i think the movie has a great deal of humor and is just a good,i 've always been fascinated by the fact that this is an excellent film
1,do yourself a favor and rent this,do n't worry about this movie
1,cheadle is excellent as a young man trying to find the,cheadle is also great and he 's great in it
1,the acting is so bad it makes it hard to believe,the story is very interesting and has some great twists and turns
1,so i think it 's a great movie,so the story is not as complicated as in
1,the acting is good but not for the whole family,the film is about a young couple who get caught up
1,whoever thought of the original movie as the first movie in,whoever made this movie should n't be ashamed of themselves
1,and i do n't care for anybody,and then there was the ending
1,one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie is when the guy is on the run,one scene where he says he is a woman with the words is one of the best in
1,but the movie was a little too long for,but it does n't even matter to me
1,okay so this movie is n't bad,okay i do n't have the words for
1,spoilers the plot has been told and the acting is a bit weak,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers this movie is about as much fun to watch
1,a lot of the acting in the film is very good but the rest of the cast just seemed to be,a very enjoyable and interesting account of the life of one of the finest people in the history of cinema
1,but the movie is a lot of fun,but i did n't have to pay for it
1,how about the fact that the movie,how many times can you say
1,the plot is pretty good and the acting was,the movie also had a very nice soundtrack
1,if i had to see this for the second time in my life i would n't be,if the producers had to choose between them i would n't have given it a chance
1,this is a very good movie for the most diehard,this film has nothing to do with the book
1,when the movie is finished i feel that the film could have been a decent film but the execution of the film is just,when the first film ended was one of the most controversial of the 90 's i had to see what i 'd heard
1,randolph scott plays the part of a good guy who gets caught by an evil murderer and the guy who is trying to solve his crime,randolph scott 's character is a bit dim and it is not difficult for him to make a movie that is not only the funniest movie he
1,daylewis is a very talented director and a great,daylewis was the best part of the movie
1,next up i 'd say that the director should have been shot on a more or less film in the early 90 's and then it 's too hard,next time we see the movie we see the same old man who is the only one in the film who is the father of the young man
1,those who are looking for some good horror and horror,those who enjoy this show will probably enjoy it
1,you can only imagine the whole movie,you will see him as well as his
1,rush is one of those films that you will see once you will not,rush away from the film and then get it out of the way
1,despite the fact that the movie has a lot of plot holes the film is n't a good one to say,despite the fact that this movie was made by the critics and the other critics in the cast list i must say
1,the acting is superb but the script is awful,the only way the audience can see is the scene
1,i do n't know if i was a child or something but this movie was so much fun watching this one i was so scared,i have been in high school since childhood and i have seen it over and over again and again and still remember the titans
1,the script is so poor that it is hard to follow,the first time i saw this film i was not impressed
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the cinematography but it does not,the movie is very slow paced and is a complete waste of time
1,gilbert roshan plays the part of the main,gilbert roshan is also a good actor
1,the acting the script the editing and the directing all contribute to the fun and i think i,the story is n't too bad but there is nothing new and it 's not that bad
1,during a nightly chase sequence the film is about as bad as it gets,during the first half of this film the viewer does n't care for any of
1,more of a psychological experience is a very good film,more importantly i could see what the director was trying to
1,i have n't read the manga but i do n't think that is what,i was surprised to find such a bad movie i was n't disappointed
1,frankly i do n't think that the movie is so funny because,frankly i do n't think i 've ever seen the movie
1,rudy vallee and david morse are both good in their roles but i was impressed with their performances,rudy vallee plays a very convincing character who is always the only one that can make up a fight
1,a very interesting and interesting film,a lot of the dialogue is just
1,pooja plays the mother 's mother and,pooja has no problems with her
1,martin sheen is a wonderful actor but he was the only character who could possibly make,martin sheen is excellent as the villain and he plays a nice guy in this
1,thank goodness they had a chance to cancel out the,thank god that the last one was so disappointing
1,even though this is not a movie i can see a movie that has been,even though the acting was n't all that great it 's not really bad
1,a lot of people have already seen a good movie,a very good example of what happens when the film goes
1,i do n't know how many times we are talking about a movie that has n't already been done,i think it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen it was a great film
1,accidentally the movie was made and the ending was,accidentally the two are reunited with each other
1,the film is a great example of what it means,the plot of the movie is just plain stupid
1,with the exception of the title role this film does n't,with that said i did n't know what to expect
1,patton has a few scenes with a guy and the,patton is the only one who can do that
1,the film 's plot is about an aging woman trying to cope with a wealthy woman who 's dying with the death of her mother and his mother 's death,the plot is pretty much all of a sudden rip offs of a mad mad mad scientist and the beast and it is a little slow paced and a little slow
1,the story is about two young adults who live in a small apartment building where the world has become a place where a group of young men are in the city of arkansas and the city is ruled by a mysterious and powerful group,the movie was shot in new zealand but it was a very good movie for its day in which i have been a little jaded and i can see it in my head and that the people in it are very well done
1,harry potter is a genius who is not just a little stiff,harry potter and matt clark were very good in this movie
1,films like this are n't bad but it 's a lot,films like this are not the case in this one
1,while a few scenes are a little slow at times there is a scene where the two characters have the audacity that the movie was going to be in the final reel,while a good movie is not about the effects i would have expected that a lot of them were not just the same actors who had to play in this movie
1,i have seen some great movies and this is one of them,i am sure there are more reasons for why the two main characters
1,i think it would be a shame that this is n't a comedy,i think this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,highly recommended for those who enjoy movies that,highly recommended for lovers of italian literature
1,i 've been a fan of this series but i can honestly say that it 's a little too far,i think that the film was shot in a very small budget and a lot of it would have been so
1,now i am a big fan of the series but this one is not one of those movies,now this is not one of the best films ever it 's a movie that should have been made
1,shia labeouf 's performance is a bit subdued but the rest of,shia labeouf is the perfect choice for her part in this
1,whether the movie was good or not it just made it look like citizen kane,whether or not you can watch it you will probably be bored out of their mind
1,although a few people are killed i still ca n't understand what 's going on,although the characters are not developed in the film the plot is very contrived
1,erm this is the best of the four shorts,erm the movie was n't that horrible but it was
1,it does n't take the spectator for a lot of the film to be interesting,it 's the story of three brothers who live together in a small farmhouse and are
1,this is a good family film about a dysfunctional family of the younger brother who gets the job to go on a,this is a must see for anyone interested in film history or for the sheer enjoyment in the art of acting
1,could they be a bit more entertaining,could n't they just have had some sort
1,from the beginning i was convinced that the movie,from the beginning this film is just awful
1,many of us will have some doubts of seeing this,many people think that this is a good movie and should
1,just because i was a kid this was not an exaggeration,just because they were all of a more interesting or more important
1,the movie also features a very attractive young,the story is very basic and predictable
1,the acting was good and the story line is very solid and i liked the,the only saving grace to it is that it was shot in new york
1,starring the late great peter ustinov and the inimitable,starring the great christopher plummer as the lead
1,penelope kapoor is excellent as she is given the thankless role of the film but she,penelope raines as the heroine of the film is wonderful and i really liked that
1,ronnie is a real jerk and a great one to watch,ronnie and his friends are also the main characters that the film
1,i saw it in a sneak preview of the movie theater at a theater,i saw a screener screening of this movie in the theater and i did n't
1,if the story is to be remade and the script is a little over the top,if you 're a fan of the original then you 're going to love it
1,i was very pleased with the movie and i was very surprised how much,i have been a big fan of the movies since the first movie
1,also the acting was good enough,also i have a soft problem that
1,fairly good acting from all involved,fairly entertaining to watch but this one
1,come on guys that 's not going to do anything like this,come on this movie is not a total waste of time it 's
1,lets face it you will get a lot of good laughs,lets not forget that this is the worst movie ever
1,she does n't have to pay to be killed in a car accident,she does n't seem to be much like the girl in a rubber suit
1,actorsactresses have done a great job,actorsactresses have no chemistry whatsoever and it
1,ca n't you have this movie on your,ca n't wait for the dvd release
1,another reviewer who has seen this movie has said that the movie is about the subject of the story and the characters and the story is very well developed,another example is the scene where he tells the story of an older man who had been in the business of his wife 's death in the middle of his
1,for example the whole scene of the film is just so boring that i,for a movie like this one that 's pretty cool in its entirety
1,i'm a fan of this series,i'm sorry but i have to give
1,movies are often a bad thing that,movies like this are the best
1,just to see the film is not as good as it should have been,just like the other comments i did n't get the point it 's not a
1,gidget is a beautiful actress and she 's perfect as the woman,gidget 's character is not believable and she is not believable
1,benjamin is a good actor with a lot of screen time,benjamin 's father who was the son of a son and a
1,in the end he was the most powerful of the three and the,in fact the movie is not about as bad as it is
1,meanwhile there is a little bit of a story,meanwhile the young man is a bit dim and the
1,it was an interesting experience to watch and i still enjoyed the movie,it seems that all of these were the actors who made up their lines
1,but the movie is a lot of fun,but i do n't know what to think
1,the story was a bit contrived but the actors are n't bad either,the film was shot in a very grainy and cheap way and it looks
1,but it 's still a good movie,but there 's no denying that a story
1,the script by eric wood is a joke that is not to be missed,the acting is good but it is not really the case that most of the
1,it 's an insult to those who are n't interested in the story,it 's just a movie made by a bunch of people to make a
1,natty mukherjee plays her character perfectly with an interesting performance,natty mukherjee is one of the most underrated actress of the
1,intriguing and intriguing the film is a little hard to watch and,intriguing to the bone and is a great piece of work
1,throughout the whole film he is shown with his wife and her daughter,throughout the film he has a tendency to play the character and does n't
1,who is n't the only thing that could n't possibly be done in,who cares when he has to be a man with a beard
1,they were n't all so much more,they are all so good in the movie
1,in short i think the film is a,in fact it was a bit long
1,but i guess the filmmakers were trying to make a point of making the film,but it was a nice touch to watch and it was n't too bad
1,the film 's plot is a mess from the beginning to,the film is n't a very funny one at all
1,to the extent i would have to say this movie,to me it 's an absolute waste of time
1,his mother who is the one with him is the one who gets him into the heart of his life in,his character is a caricature and it 's difficult to believe him to be able to get a good performance
1,vlad and hare have to be seen as the first one,vlad is in love with a married man and her lover has
1,but the real problem is that it 's not very well made,but the film itself is so bad that it 's almost unbearable
1,akshaye khanna plays the part of a man,akshaye khanna is a delight to watch
1,shanghai fried is n't a movie,shanghai triad is an excellent and very
1,this is a movie that i could,this movie is a complete mess
1,just as a person who does n't like it and,just a few months later she 's a woman
1,the story is a little farfetched,the movie is not very well written
1,here 's a list of events that should have been included,here the acting is superb and so is the plot
1,i was n't expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised by,i think this movie is a complete waste of time
1,i would like this film for the first 10 minutes or so,i saw this movie at the 2005 festival in the us and i
1,while the film 's technical aspects are rather similar to the first film it does n't even look good to me that,while the movie is a bit dated it does n't have a great deal of suspense and a very predictable plot
1,his role in this movie was a bit,his role is so strong and funny
1,this is a film that will not disappoint and you will be rewarded to tears,this is n't the case with harry 's family but it 's a good thing because
1,she 's a good girl who is a bit too old to be a good actress and a good actress,she is a woman of the age and is now living in a world where she does n't want her daughter
1,a film that should never have been made and the,a very enjoyable and entertaining movie with a message
1,whether the director 's intention is to make a film or two or a b,whether it 's the film 's trailer it 's not a very interesting movie
1,a lot of people have claimed that the,a great movie for the whole family
1,this film is a total failure,this film is a complete waste of
1,only the movie could 've been a little better,only in this case the movie fails to deliver the
1,when i first saw it i thought the acting was pretty good but i was really bored by the,when the movie ends we are left wondering why the film is going to be such a success
1,what a wonderful cast of characters,what a waste of the talents of
1,this is the best film of the last decade,this is the most boring movie you 'll ever see
1,i 've seen this movie many times but it 's just not,i think they are trying to make this show more realistic
1,and then there was the fact that there,and that 's a little too much
1,even the acting is n't good enough with all the actresses involved,even if they 're not a complete waste of time it 's not
1,but then we 're left with the feeling that it would be a great idea for a story,but the rest of the movie is just so bad and the story lines are so bad that the
1,6 the plot was n't that bad and was the biggest selling on the whole movie,6 the movie 's main theme is that of a woman who is a very nice woman
1,this film has no story no real story line no real story,this is the best film i have seen in a long time
1,but the rest was n't so bad it 's,but i guess i was n't so sure
1,ray is the only person who has been a successful actor,ray milland and james coburn are the best actors in this bunch
1,this was n't the best of the two,this one is so awful it makes it unwatchable
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie is one of those movies i have
1,what a waste of time and talent,what the hell is going on
1,but i think they 're not that bad,but it 's a good movie to watch because
1,it 's not a bad film as well,it is a very good film and i recommend
1,i think they did an awesome job,i was so surprised at how bad it
1,this film was a great success of the classic british movie,this movie was one that i have seen for years
1,the plot is very thin and it 's hard to understand why the movie is n't a total failure,the acting is horrible and the plot is so stupid and so unbelievable that it makes this movie unbearable
1,this is a pretty funny movie but in the end the whole thing is so predictable and,this film is not a comedy or a drama but rather a film for a film
1,in fact if you are a fan of the book this is a very enjoyable movie,in this film we 're shown a movie about a woman who is pregnant and has been
1,the plot line is very thin and the story is very contrived and boring,the film is set in the present day and it takes a bit too long
1,i think that 's a problem since i do n't think,i do not think that this film is a masterpiece
1,so i can understand the movie for a few reasons but i think the filmmakers are not going to get a lot of screen time in,so much of his work was in the public domain in this movie as the first film and that was the first to the point
1,it 's not a bad movie at all but a good time capsule of,it is a shame the rest of the film is a total bore
1,followed the plot for some parts in a very simple manner,followed by the fact that the movie was a long time the
1,they should not be the smartest film to come from the studio,they are all a couple of years from a time of great tribulation
1,they should 've spent all day on this movie and it would have been a better movie,they have a few lines to say the least about the story it was so funny
1,i do n't understand that the film is a complete mess of a film with the right mix of the characters,i was so excited when i first saw a preview of this film in the theater and thought i would have it
1,lorne greene as the leader of a group of other british,lorne greene was in the movie for a long day
1,bill paxton is a good actor in the title role as a man,bill pullman 's portrayal of the president of the united states is a very
1,cooley high was a very good movie but the acting and script were horrible,cooley high was a very good movie with great acting from the leads
1,the story is not really as good as this one,the film 's only saving grace is that he was so
1,i think the reason this movie is so underrated,i am amazed that this is not available
1,all i got was a film that has been released in a very long time and it 's a great movie,all i saw on this movie was that the movie is about a guy trying to get to know her
1,there 's no way to do that to make a movie,there was also the fact that this is one of the worst
1,this film was just plain bad,this is a film that is so
1,with a cast of young actors and crew that could not have done the best,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it 's a little bit more enjoyable
1,first of all the plot is so bad that it 's hard to understand,first of all the acting is n't bad but the script is bad
1,just as a kid is not as good as his other two companions,just like that 's why you 'd want to watch this movie
1,the first film is not that great but it 's a fun film,the film is not very good it is about a group of teens who
1,it is a very good film but i think it 's a very good movie and it deserves a,it 's all pretty much the same as the first two but it 's just a good game
1,my friend said it was great,my favorite scene was when she 's
1,after a couple of hours i was n't sure where it would,after the film 's release this is a truly awful movie
1,i do n't know if the director was supposed to look,i was surprised at how well done this film was
1,this show is so much better than the simpsons which is the first,this film has a lot of flaws and it has many twists in it
1,as a result it was the first time i saw this movie i thought the acting and directing was superb,as a matter of fact the story is not a complete mess and it 's a little too slow
1,this was the biggest problem i have with the movie,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,he does n't seem to know what,he is a very good director
1,again there was a lot of the film,again this is a film that has to be
1,although the movie has a few flaws in it it 's a very fun,although it was a very enjoyable film and a good one at that
1,those are the only ones i can find most enjoyable in this,those who love this film are not happy with the movie
1,head was the best part of this,head of a doubt is what it 's
1,you 'll get a few laughs out of it,you can get the chance to see this film and
1,was n't this a good idea,was he trying to convince his mother
1,omar sharif plays the character in this movie and i do n't,omar sharif and john malkovich are perfect as the main characters
1,very good movie for those who love to see a,very few of us have seen this movie since
1,anybody who is not a fan of the original should be ashamed,anybody who has ever seen it and wants to laugh at how funny
1,make me feel like i was watching,make the film even more ridiculous
1,seriously if you 're looking for a scary movie i,seriously i would have given this movie a zero
1,the movie is a complete mess but it does make,the first half of the movie is really bad
1,it 's a shame that such a movie,it is n't that good at all
1,i would like to see a lot of movies that i like and love,i have to disagree with the comments that this film was very poor
1,the plot is about a man who gets a job and is taken from a mental hospital to protect his,the acting and script is awful at worst and worst of all there are no special effects or thrills
1,my advice is to avoid this,my favorite is the scene of the
1,he is a man that can control his life in a way that he is,he was the only one who did his best to be a very talented man
1,i 've seen better acting in movies than that,i do think this is one of the best movies
1,she also has a very nice relationship between them,she was in the same class of being a young
1,the plot is simple and the movie has no point of interest at all,the story of the movie revolves around a young woman who lives in a city
1,i have seen many movies that are not even that good,i was expecting a lot more from my favorite movie the first
1,lately he is a great man and his wife has been a great singer for many years,lately the film is about a family who 's being stalked by a group of students in order
1,much of the film involves a couple of people who were murdered by,much of this is how the film goes from being a comedy
1,strangely he is not the least likable character in,strangely the film is not a bad one
1,so the movie is a little long but you ca n't get the impression that it 's,so i was a teenager and the guy who made this movie was just soooo bad
1,oh and i 've read the book a little over the years i 've heard this film has been called a movie for a long time,oh well i ca n't believe the same thing that happened in my mind but this movie is a total waste of time and money
1,why would you like to see this film,why is n't it a bad film or a
1,what is a great thing to say about this film is that it 's a film about a,what a great show and i have to say that i have to admit i loved it
1,a good example is that the characters are n't so bad,a film about a woman named seita is played by a young
1,the movie has a few moments but it 's not enough to,the movie is n't bad but it 's not that good
1,to begin with a good plot line is a bit of a stretch for me and i would recommend it to anyone,to make it even more interesting the film is very funny in a way that makes you think that you have to see
1,even though it was filmed at the end of the first era it was,even though it 's a little slow the story is a little confusing
1,recently we are shown on the screen,recently he was in the film and we
1,the movie is n't bad but the,the script is not very clever
1,i was a bit puzzled to see how much i hated it but i did,i was surprised to see that this film is in a top 100 of all time
1,nearly every single member of the cast deserves to die,nearly every character has a motive for hisher own lives and
1,this movie was made with a budget of about,this movie was made in the first place
1,i have seen better films in my lifetime and this one ranks among the,i have seen this film several times and never really tire of it
1,but it does make you feel like you are not the ones that are watching a movie,but it just seems like a bunch of friends with the same problem as a porn movie
1,but it was not that funny to watch,but the fact that this film was made is
1,tubbs is a very good film about a man,tubbs 's father is a very young girl
1,maybe they should 've done a few more,maybe the best of all the movies of the
1,but the film is very entertaining and it 's still a fun movie with lots of action,but this was the first film i 've ever seen and i do n't really see the point
1,christopher walken plays a young boy who is sent to an asylum where he 's not a teenager and his son is a teenager who has a daughter and,christopher lee has done this godawful attempt to act a little bit of the requisite but the film is just a little too much to be taken seriously
1,need to see it for free,need to see this film again
1,lex luthor is a very talented director who can make a movie,lex luthor is a good director he has done some excellent work with
1,but it is not the worst movie i,but it is a little too slow
1,overall the film is very entertaining with,overall this is a great film
1,i was very pleasantly surprised by this film,i would have liked to have seen it more
1,i have to admit to the obvious lack of a good cast in the movie that was the only,i have no idea if it was the fact that he was the first film to be made
1,contrast to the old fashioned old man in the hat and the other one that is a very interesting one,contrast to the story of a young man who is in prison to celebrate his life with a little girl
1,it is the kind of film that should be made available to us,it 's just a shame because the acting is horrible and the acting is
1,familiar faces of the genre are present,familiar faces like robert altman and james cameron
1,the only good thing about this movie is the ending the ending was very predictable,the film is not as good as some of the others that are good and i
1,leigh 's performance is not the most important thing,leigh 's direction of the movie is the same and
1,a very interesting film with great performances of all,a movie that should have a lot of potential if
1,only a couple of weeks ago the film is not as bad as the first film,only to be able to make the point of view and the audience in a sense that
1,but the story line is not that great,but the film does a lot more with it
1,the only redeeming factor to this film is how the filmmakers are able to pull out all the good stuff that the first movie did,the plot is so convoluted and so ridiculous it makes it difficult to watch the whole thing but it has to make you laugh
1,this is an extremely well done drama,this is a really really good movie
1,and the film is so bad that it is almost unwatchable,and it 's a shame they do n't make any more of
1,one of the best things about this film are the,one of the best films i 've ever seen
1,i do n't know whether to call it a comedy but i would say that the,i was very impressed by the ending and that 's why i liked the movie
1,all of the acting is superb and the,all in all a pretty good film
1,the first film was a little slow moving but the film itself was so good,the film is an attempt by the viewer to get a glimpse of a woman
1,a lot of the movie 's plot is not so good,a few years ago it has been a cult film
1,jack lemmon 's portrayal of a father 's life as an assassin,jack 's character and the other characters are also very good
1,primarily the script by robert walker is the,primarily the script is a complete mess
1,clouse 's film is one of the best of the genre in my opinion it is not as funny as in the first,clouse and his cohorts make it a lot more interesting and it makes you want to throw a knife at the screen and then
1,i think he was the worst person in the world,i 've been watching this film over the years and have
1,like in all of his other movies he is an expert who has,like the previous poster said it 's the worst kind of movie
1,first of all i 'd rather see,first off the acting is terrible
1,the film has been done in several ways but it is n't,the film is set on the same day that the first movie was
1,i have never seen a movie like this,i would recommend it to any fan of a
1,i do n't think the actors were trying to be a real actor,i 've heard that this film is a remake of the book
1,after that the movie has a very good cast and it really makes you wish it could have,after a few minutes of watching this movie you can only get to know what is happening
1,this movie has the best of the best,this is a film for everyone who wants to
1,the only thing that made me laugh,the film is a total bore
1,and then the film starts with the main hero being killed by a woman who,and the ending does n't make a lick of sense and is quite unsatisfying
1,it was a waste of time for,it 's not the same thing
1,the story line is a simple mix of drama,the film is n't even a good movie
1,in the first film they are a very good and very good movie,in fact they did a better job of making the film better
1,german cinema is an example of why a movie that is so good,german director michael dudikoff does n't have a problem with the original
1,sadly the film is n't that bad,sadly this is n't what the film was
1,and it 's the story of a guy who gets the girl of an old flame to get a little girl,and i was n't even a big fan of his character so i was n't looking forward to seeing him in the
1,i have seen all of the episodes of the sopranos and it is the most entertaining episode,i 've seen the first few films which are so bad that this one has to be one
1,i do n't know if it is a film or a horror or movie but it is,i do n't remember seeing the first film in this film but that was n't enough
1,this is a really well directed and acted,this is a movie of all things
1,the plot is so thin that you can actually tell the difference between the two,the story is a bit of a drama but i think it was a lot of
1,but i was really surprised to see the movie that i did n't really understand the movie and i,but the movie is not for people that want more of it than to make a good film
1,this is one of the most boring,this film is a must see
1,overall the movie is very good and it works,overall if you are looking for something different then i
1,they all have some good lines that is the first of many,they do n't even try the same but the rest of the movie
1,with the exception of the two main actors they are also very good at playing,with a better cast in the movie this is a fine movie to show
1,i saw this movie at the san diego international film festival,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival on the big
1,so many of us will never get a grip on what they are doing,so if you do n't get the message you should have to be a little
1,with the addition of a couple of good actors the movie is pretty much a,with no hesitation at all this movie will leave you feeling uneasy at times
1,for the first few minutes i had to turn the,for those who want to make movies like this
1,it was a very nice film,it 's a great show that i
1,a very good movie with great characters,a good example of how the movie is
1,in one scene a man in a car,in fact the movie has its flaws
1,while the film was a little choppy the story was very interesting and it was n't really a comedy,while i was in the mood for some sort of catharsis it was very well crafted and well executed
1,i have to mention to the people of the above that this movie was a great idea,i was a little confused when it was over my own eyes in the end that the film
1,if you 've seen a few episodes of the original the story of a serial killer then you might enjoy the first half,if you can stand to watch this show to see if you can locate your dvd copy of the film it should be as
1,the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible,the film does n't even come close to being one
1,to me this was one of the worst movies i have,to say more would spoil my enjoyment with this one
1,all of them in this film and the,all in all a pretty good movie
1,i have n't laughed once and while i do,i do n't know how to describe it
1,other than that you could do that to yourself,other than that i was a little hesitant about this
1,clerks is not the greatest comedy ever,clerks is one of my favourite films
1,steven spielberg has done a wonderful job,steven spielberg is also the director 's best
1,not that i have a fondness for the film but i,not to mention that the plot was a bit thin
1,a very interesting and very funny film,a good premise to begin with
1,they should have given the film a little more credit,they all seem to be having a blast and they have
1,this film is a masterpiece of sorts and one of my favorites,this is one of several movies where you are a young person and
1,it has the same sort of humor and charm to the whole movie,it was a very good movie but i do have to admit that i
1,yes the ending is very satisfying and the end result is a,yes there is a good plot but i was pleasantly surprised
1,it 's a shame that such a poor quality of film has,it seems that the director wanted to make a good film
1,a great performance by the cast that i loved about,a few of the scenes were cut off but the actors
1,and i do n't want to give away a spoiler,and that is why the movie does not work
1,i 've seen this movie countless times and i have to say it is one of the most memorable,i was n't expecting a lot of movies but i do n't think the film really should be
1,perhaps that 's what the producers of,perhaps the film 's best asset
1,sadly there is a scene where the two protagonists get their head blown out of their necks and then they,sadly i found the film 's focus of this movie to be as good and memorable as it was
1,they all have a great story line and a good,they 're not even close to their normal counterparts
1,so i have to say i am very impressed,so i have to admit that it was a bit
1,here it 's a bit too long,here 's the real problem here
1,vhs is the most entertaining film of all time,vhs copy i saw the movie and i was very
1,i saw this movie at the waterfront film festival,i 've seen the first two and is quite a
1,of course they are in a different way,of course the only thing that is good about
1,as a result the script is very very weak and there are some really good scenes of events thrown together and the final scene is so powerful,as for the plot well the movie is not a great one either but i have to say that it really was a great film to watch
1,the acting is terrible and i ca n't imagine anyone else who was in the film at all and i thought it was,the script has been written by a bunch of actors that are in the same league as the director or the director
1,the acting is so stiff and so stupid that it makes you think,the movie starts with a bang and then a woman named alice who goes
1,angels have to do the right thing,angels are not all that impressed by the
1,i have to admit i had never thought of that as a whole,i have no idea how a film of this kind can be made but
1,overall the movie is pretty good,overall this movie is a good movie
1,anita is an aspiring actress who has a,anita winger is a delight to watch
1,in fact the whole cast is good the story is pretty basic,in the beginning of the movie the audience sees a very beautiful and
1,dil is the most intelligent person to come,dil de vaca is an excellent film
1,now this is a pretty bad movie,now i'm sure you will not be disappointed
1,probably a good idea to make a movie,probably the biggest problem is the lack of any
1,ok i 'll be a fan of,ok i know what 's wrong
1,the story is about two friends who have to deal with their jobs and the two,the acting was good but i was n't sure what this movie was really about
1,in this one he 's not just a bad,in fact this film is not for me
1,by the time it comes out the viewer is forced to feel sorry for his brother,by the time the end credits rolled you were wondering if there were no other alternatives to
1,anyway i have seen some of the,anyway the film is very funny
1,a great cast of characters from the past,a few years later they were both in their
1,rain has been a great movie since a movie that is so great it,rain has a great deal of humor and the acting is very good
1,it is n't so long ago as it 's been in a long time,it 's a very sad and touching story and it is the story of a
1,along the way a few young adults are invited to find themselves at their local,along with his other films i 've seen that one of the better ones
1,there is n't a single scene where the film has a purpose and i was n't impressed to find any of the film 's redeeming qualities,there is one good scene in particular that i remember when i saw the movie i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it also had the look of a movie about people getting,it 's a shame because the movie is pretty entertaining
1,a few things are the best,a great cast of characters who are
1,but there was nothing to be said about this film,but it 's a bit of an action film
1,a few of the characters are just a bit bit shallow and,a great movie that will not be forgotten by everyone involved
1,it does n't take much of a budget to produce a film,it 's just that the director and the screenwriter and director should have
1,if you want to watch a movie about a bunch of teens in a small,if you like it and you like it watch it and then do n't
1,being there 's an explanation for the film 's audience not to mention the fact that it had,being a huge fan of the original series i must admit i did n't enjoy the series
1,do n't expect to miss this gem,do n't worry about this movie and the
1,it was n't a great movie and it had to do with,it seems so long that it is not even a comedy
1,although there were some great things about the original,although he does the best he can do
1,apparently it was just a film about one 's inability to cope with the other problems of the story,apparently the director was a writer with a lot of problems that were n't so much of an issue and
1,icet is a good actor as he 's the only actor that,icet was the only actor i liked him as a character
1,the first movie was a bit of a letdown,the story is simple and the characters are very likable
1,corporation was a great show to watch,corporation 's greatest film star and it 's
1,for example the two main characters and the main characters,for those who have a taste of humor and love this
1,the movie is very good and is,the story line was very simple
1,i'm glad i did not have to go to watch this movie,i'm a huge fan of movies and i have a lot of time
1,everyone in this movie is either mentally retarded or a,everyone is either a good or even bad guy
1,well i do n't think so i have,well this movie is one big joke
1,any movie that can compare this to the original is just awful,any of this could have been done without a good script
1,then again i do n't know if i was in the theater or did n't know that the whole movie was about a guy trying to be a,then there was the fact that the characters were not so much as they were the real ones and that the movie was not a good idea
1,i have to give it a 7 but it is one,i do n't know if i was watching a documentary but i
1,also the ending was a bit abrupt but hey it 's a little more than a movie,also in a movie with a plot and characters who are not developed well at all
1,the movie was shot in a time where the film is made to work with,the film is a complete mess of a movie that was n't even funny
1,a few minutes later the girl decides to take a shower to get a beer to his head while driving the car,a few people have commented about this movie that i think they should n't have made any other films like this
1,the only reason i gave this film a 2 instead of a 0,the plot of a man who is a little bit of an idiot is
1,but i do n't think that is the point to the plot,but it 's still a pretty decent horror film and a good one
1,climbing with the wind is a wonderful and very wellacted film,climbing to the top of a mountain of water is the only
1,i would not recommend this movie for anybody,i saw the trailer on the film and the
1,ching dillman and john carradine are very believable in the,ching capote 's score is a very mixed bag
1,the first time i saw the movie i was n't disappointed,the only way you could have a great film is when the
1,this has all of this is the most amazing film ever done,this is one of the most beautiful movie i 've ever seen and
1,yet the whole thing is just an excuse to get into the game,yet it was a nice surprise that you had to endure the film as
1,selfrespecting actors were a great surprise but not as,selfrespecting horror film buffs will probably enjoy it
1,i am amazed that the makers had to have a lot to do with the,i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a very very good movie
1,save your own money do n't waste your money on,save your money and do not watch this film
1,i do n't know if they were trying to make a movie based on a true story or a character study but they could,i do n't care how many times they 're in this movie but the actors did n't even look like a real person
1,with this being a great horror film i 've seen a lot of other horror gems and i have to admit that i do n't know what it was like,with a lot of action sequences and a couple of scenes in the movie where a little girl is killed with a machete that is n't even close to the truth
1,i have seen this series twice and will have to wait,i 've been waiting for this movie to get better
1,the story is n't bad the characters,the story is a bit confusing
1,i was expecting something more like this one because of the great performances by a few,i saw this movie and the previews were not as good as the first film
1,but the movie has a very interesting premise and a very good script,but this movie just did not have the good elements of the first one
1,this movie is so bad that it 's a waste of a good cast,this is one of those films that is a complete waste of time
1,i was a little disappointed at the end,i was n't disappointed by this movie
1,i do n't want to go to the cinema that i have,i have no idea who 's who i think it 's
1,the acting is terrible and the writing just plain,the acting in the movie was so bad
1,although this show is n't as stupid as it is the series is more entertaining,although the story was n't as good as it could have been and the characters were
1,however in fact it 's a good,however this is not a movie
1,the film was a total mess,the plot is about a young man
1,well the film is pretty much the same,well the acting is good but i think that
1,stardust has a few interesting moments and it has to be very very difficult to make a movie that makes the movie so much more fun,stardust is a film where the story of a group of friends of mine and the hardships of the community are so different in the world that
1,as a result of the movie the plot is very simple and there are a lot of problems,as the movie continues the two begin to lose their grip on the film by the end
1,people who think he 's a good guy but do n't know that it 's not the same,people in this film are either very bad and just plain stupid but this one is just so bad
1,it seems that the director and writers were trying to get the audience into the,it 's a real shame because the movie is so bad it 's good
1,it seems the producers had to be trying to put it mildly realistic but it,it 's a pity as the best part of the movie was the song
1,it is a very moving film which is,it was a complete disaster for me
1,the story is a little bit predictable but it is n't too much a good idea,the movie does n't get the same level of the story and the ending is a bit
1,they have a very funny and funny scene,they should be able to get a little more
1,the movie was a lot better than what you would call from it,the story is about a group of people who are trying to steal their
1,the plot was weak and the acting was just poor,the plot line of the film is a bit weak but
1,noticing the plot is n't a good one at all,noticing the plot is that there are two main characters in
1,since there is a lot of nudity the movie,since then i have a fondness for movies
1,a good movie to have seen,a few years after i watched this
1,this is the type of movie that you 'd want to,this is not a good movie but it was n't
1,and what do they really think of them when they are not going to go anywhere,and it 's not the kind of movie that is so bad it 's good
1,widmark plays a woman who is trying to find the girl in her apartment while she 's trying to find a job to,widmark has a small role as one of the great beauties that has a thankless role as the villain of the movie
1,buy a car and you 'll be rewarded,buy the book and you 'll see what 's
1,that 's why he was n't a star and a great actor and a good actor,that 's all it has going for it but this film does n't do it for me
1,i think this movie has been a great success,i think it is a very good film
1,i would love to hear a song sung by the song,i think it 's an interesting story but it is still a
1,there are some good moments but not all of them are good,there is also a lot of the characters and the characters
1,so the movie has to get a little better,so i do not know where to begin
1,innocently this movie is so bad it makes you want to vomit,innocently the movie is a little too melodramatic and too boring to be
1,taking the first time i was able to see it,taking the same plot with the help of a young girl
1,for me it 's the same kind of humor that we are given to a movie where the hero,for me i could n't stand the entire thing and the movie was a total waste of time
1,does it take the viewer for a,does this show have been made
1,i 've seen some other movies from my life but this is not one of them,i saw the film at the toronto international film festival and found it thoroughly entertaining
1,the movie is about a young couple of friends,the script by robert sherwood was pretty funny
1,you can watch it on one night when you get a chance to find a good movie,you know it is in trouble when a movie with a man named a girl with a different
1,do n't be afraid to have the movie,do yourself a favour and do n't watch it
1,i think the best part of the movie is the fact that it takes place,i have seen a lot of movies that are so bad they 're good
1,or even a good one but it is not as bad as you could expect,or maybe it 's not just for those who want to know what happens to them
1,the film is very well made,the movie has a very good pace
1,having read the book the book and read the book the book was,having seen this movie several times it still is a great movie
1,that 's not to say that it,that was a lot of fun
1,all the characters are just so real and lovable that they,all in all the film is n't even remotely funny
1,probably a lot of people think it 's a bad movie,probably the most memorable thing about this movie is the fact that
1,she is a very good actress,she 's the main reason to make
1,i was surprised with the ending as a little bit of the ending,i was very disappointed when it was shown on tv in the early 80
1,to my amazement he is so much more of an important character than his usual role in the book,to say that this movie was n't made by the same people as i would be a good deal is
1,i have seen this film a long time ago,i 've seen the original movie and the film is
1,with the exception of the first half of this movie i was hoping that the sequel would,with all the shortcomings it could have been that i have a fondness for the movie
1,everything about this movie is just plain awful,everything is so bad that it makes you wish
1,as far as i can tell the story is about a man who has a son in,as for the story i could n't believe that this was going to be a film
1,the film is a little more than a horror thriller,the story is a little weak and the plot is n't
1,folding at the top of the stairs the only two,folding on to a good degree of the movie
1,or maybe the film is too long,or even the slightest bit of the plot
1,we get to see some pretty ugly actors like a group of thugs who are in a wheelchair and have a,we get to see him in a movie and this one is a perfect example of how he can be
1,this is n't an excellent movie it 's not a total failure of,this is just a fun movie that i would like to know
1,this was n't really the worst movie i 've seen,this is n't a bad movie as a whole
1,supporting cast are n't bad either so why not,supporting character development in a way is a little too
1,the acting is pretty good but the story itself is a little weak,the first time i watched this i had to laugh when i had heard
1,then the film switches back into the story of what a real world of people is in reality and,then the story starts to go horribly wrong and the ending seems like they 're going to die
1,the only redeeming feature of this film is the fact that this was made in the us and in the early 90 's the film was released on video and,the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that i was not impressed by the film because i was bored at how it was going to end
1,it is n't that it 's not a total washout,it 's a great movie to see and it 's very
1,the movie is just a waste of time,the plot is so predictable it becomes laughable
1,in the book the director writer writer john,in the film he meets his father
1,this movie has been said in the,this is a very funny film
1,a great deal of laughs and a very enjoyable one at that,a few years ago a friend in a mental hospital who was a
1,there were a few scenes i could 've done have been left at the beginning of the movie,there are some good things in the movie but it 's not the best movie i 've seen but
1,then we 're introduced to the characters that are supposed to be people with no real,then i went to the theater expecting that to be the worst film ever made
1,carpenter 's movie is so bad that it actually makes it to the top of the list,carpenter 's the film has some of the best scenes of film making of the genre and also
1,at least he has a chance to make a good film,at first i thought the film was a good idea
1,useful to the movie is that it is very funny and i liked this movie,useful to say it 's a good movie for those who have nothing against action films
1,based on a real event i have to give credit to this movie that much more than the imdb user rating it is an excellent and informative film,based on the popular legend of the same name as the original the film was shot in the same location as the first film the story is a bit
1,the movie was n't bad but i thought the acting was pretty decent,the acting was horrible as far as acting was concerned with bad acting
1,i would like to see more episodes of this series and this one has a chance that it can never be aired again,i 've read the comments of a couple of people that have to say the truth is that i ca n't even think of
1,this movie is not worth watching,this is one movie i would recommend
1,of course he is in a different place,of course the film is about a group of
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie,i have n't even mentioned the movie as a
1,it 's an insult to the intelligence of the director,it does n't make the slightest bit of sense
1,that is why i do n't see the end of this film,that 's not saying that there is not a lot of gore in
1,much of the story line is very predictable,much more than the original and the original was
1,so it 's not the best of the series,so why does he have to kill people
1,perhaps this is the best film about the world of mankind and how,perhaps the film makers were making the right choice for the film
1,but if you like to see a good film with a good plot,but if the show was not as bad as the first two seasons it
1,the story line has a very good plot and the story is so full of holes it is a good movie to watch,the film is about a woman who is sent to a house with the family in a small town in the middle of nowhere
1,i'm glad they did it in the first place,i'm not a big fan of bad bmovies but this
1,somewhere along the way we see a man dressed in a black cloak who,somewhere else you can get the feeling you need something to laugh about
1,no one would ever be allowed to watch this movie,no doubt it is one of the funniest movies ever
1,to say more than one line i 'd have seen,to sum it up this movie is just boring
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the acting was so horrible that i could only
1,the acting is very poor and the story is very thin,the only thing this movie did is the poster for this and
1,the acting was so bad that it seemed like a bad acid loaf,the film is a good example of how a movie is supposed to have
1,it was a very nice surprise but in the end it was very disappointing,it was a bit like a remake of romeo and juliet but it 's still
1,this is a great film and the best one is the one that is in my opinion as one of the,this movie had nothing to do with the story and i found it hard to believe it to be funny
1,it is not a movie to be a movie for people,it is a film where the story is very good
1,both men are n't in the movie,both actors are very talented and i can
1,needless to say this has to be one of the worst movies,needless to say this is the worst horror movie ever made
1,one of them is a man who,one of her best movies ever
1,in the end i found myself thinking of something to do with it,in this one he is given a few moments of comic relief
1,the film is also a complete mess,the movie has an amazing cast
1,then the film cuts to the main characters,then the plot of this film is just a
1,for those who do not know about the film the plot is just plain bad,for instance in the film we see an attractive black woman dressed in black robes
1,the acting is n't as bad as i 've seen in a long while i 've seen worse than the poor ones,the only reason i give this film a 7 is because of the fact that the film has a lot of potential
1,spoilers the movie is a little over the top in parts,spoilers ahead the main character is killed and killed by a woman
1,and that 's the problem with the film,and i do not understand what is the point
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen since gigli,this movie is a complete disgrace to all of us
1,the film has a great soundtrack and a very good,the story and the script are very very good
1,and what 's worse dawson and dave are the same guys,and the movie is a total waste for the movie
1,aherne has the best role in this movie,aherne 's character is so convincing that we are
1,if you do n't know that you 're watching this movie do n't worry,if you have n't seen a movie i recommend it to anyone who likes horror
1,for the first time he does have the nerve to,for me this movie was made in the us
1,i am a big fan of the original series,i 've seen it over and over again
1,a very good idea for the film,a good cast of characters are introduced
1,it is also a bit of a shame that this film has,it is an interesting film with lots of great acting talent
1,a film that could have been better and tighter but it just does n't work for,a lot of it was the best and most entertaining part of the entire movie
1,not much of a story or a character study,not the greatest film to be made in the past
1,the story of a young man who is a young,the movie is a little bit of a stretch
1,if you do n't want to see it go see it again,if there 's a flaw that 's not the way this film was
1,eastwood gives an incredible performance as the young christy,eastwood 's character is the only one who 's willing
1,complain is that the movie is n't a horror,complain on it but it was so bad
1,does anyone know who the hell is this,does anyone know who the murderer is
1,and that 's not saying much,and i was a little disappointed when
1,most of it has been done by the director and the director,most of the scenes where the hero is in the middle
1,you 'll have a hard time believing what the movie is,you could n't tell the difference between the two films
1,this is the first movie i 've ever seen,this is one of those movies i 've seen in
1,no wonder that the film is not a,no doubt it 's a bad movie
1,anyway it is a very entertaining movie,anyway i think this is the best of
1,in fact the movie is not a comedy that does not make any sense to the viewer,in the meantime he was n't in it and i do n't want to talk about how bad
1,i saw this in the theater and i loved the movie and i was amazed to learn that a film with no budget was wasted in the first,i would n't have seen this film in my lifetime as one of those movies that has the same kind of quality that i do n't know
1,a great example of what happens when someone,a film that is n't only bad
1,suddenly a movie is a waste of time and money,suddenly the movie is set to make sure that a lot
1,dead man is a good movie that is worth watching for the acting and,dead poets society was a pretty funny film that i thought of it
1,so much of the plot and the plot is ridiculous,so what if the movie 's story could have been done
1,hey the film does a good job of showing what happened,hey this has to be the worst film ever made i do
1,but this is a great example of how to make a movie,but it is not so easy and so well made for that it
1,shepherd is an old actress but i was,shepherd was n't the least bit convincing
1,in this case the director 's intention was to make,in fact i was not impressed with the film
1,if you like the movie that is the case with you,if you have n't seen the original and read the books you
1,as for a lot of it it was pretty much an attempt to cash in on the craze,as for the acting the movie is a bit too slow and too slow to be funny
1,but the film is a bit of,but this movie really does suck
1,mary 's character is a caricature of the young woman of the,mary 's character is so unlikable that she 's almost unrecognizable
1,ps this is a bad film,ps i have n't seen the original
1,the movie starts with a woman who is an actress and a young man in a suit who wants,the only reason this got any lower than the movie was because the movie was a complete mess
1,a lot of the film 's humor is derived from one of those old fashioned movies that,a film of note is that it has a good plot to make a great story
1,he was so stupid i could n't stand the whole thing,he 's just so damn funny and it 's easy to make
1,references to the original film were not even the first one,references to other comments on other reviews on here have said that
1,it was n't funny and i could n't believe it i would actually be laughing,it 's an excellent piece of acting and a wonderful performance by the leads
1,it is also a movie that makes you think about life in an,it 's a good thing because this film is just so good
1,every single scene with the actors and actresses is just awful,every time i see this i 'll have to wait
1,weaving out a couple of things is a great idea but not a good one,weaving the story of the characters from the film the story takes place in a time
1,holden is also a nice person but i think that it could have had some good actors,holden has the best role as the lead but the rest is a bit dull and a little
1,as far as the plot goes i was not a teenager,as for the acting this movie had a lot of potential
1,there is a little to explore in the film which makes you wonder how the people,there is a lot of action but the story has a few holes in logic
1,the film is about the same thing and that 's the problem,the plot is simple yet it 's very difficult to tell who is
1,mel brooks is the only good actor in this film,mel gibson is the most talented actor on his screen
1,ps the only reason i watched this movie was because,ps this is a movie that should be avoided
1,if you want to watch the movie you should see a movie,if you have never been on the fence before this is the film
1,i would have given the show a ten out of 10 if it had stayed as,i was really impressed by this film but in fact it was a bit disappointing
1,frankly i think this is a really good movie,frankly it 's just a waste of money
1,she 's not in this movie,she is also very good as a
1,the film is about an elderly boy who goes to a school and his girlfriend who has the job of being an artist,the movie 's main weakness is that it 's not a comedy it 's not very funny and the characters are shallow
1,the story itself is so simple that it seems to take itself too far too seriously,the acting and direction were terrible and there was no reason for the plot to get resolved
1,unfortunately the movie never fails in any department,unfortunately i 've seen better acting in better movies
1,he also is the perfect guy,he is a real person with no
1,and the movie has a very good story,and there is n't any real plot
1,there are many scenes where the camera pans off the screen with,there were so many of the things i did n't notice
1,having read all of the reviews i 've noticed that this one is a very bad movie,having seen it several times and still have a soft spot in the world of the late '60s
1,here is where the film fails,here we have an endless and implausible
1,they all had a good cast and a good script but they were n't very good either,they have been trying to find a way to kill the president and be a good friend
1,after a brief shootout with the police and the girl he decides to go on and on,after all the film has its moments it 's just the same old stuff with a bit different
1,known as the first movie i was impressed at the fact that i was a fan of,known for the same reason the film has a lot to do with its subject matter
1,however the story and the characters are all excellent and it,however this is just a movie for a little more
1,however if you 've never seen it,however it was not that funny
1,the film does n't have a lot of sex scenes but it 's a very,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that was n't worth it
1,the film is n't bad at all and that is the best thing i can say about the movie,the first time i saw it was i was in a theater of high school and the movie was very
1,a great movie to see if you can see a film,a film that should have been released on dvd for the first
1,i was n't really expecting anything else to be said but the movie itself was good enough,i 've seen this movie many times and i still remember that i saw it on tv
1,continuing to say the truth i think,continuing with a bit of the first one
1,pip is one of the most important characters ever to grace a screen,pip and his friends and the boys are both good and their lives as
1,the story is very simple and the movie has a lot of action and,the acting is very good with some good performances and a good story
1,a good movie about an aging hitman who,a great movie that 's really funny
1,but it really did n't have the same impact and this one was n't very,but it 's not that i have seen this film on tv or dvd
1,the story is a little weak,the acting is pretty good and there
1,with the exception of a good cast of young performers who were in this movie it 's a pity that the director decided that the story was not,with the help of the old man 's mother she has no qualms about how she feels she is being transported to a house by the lake
1,look at me i was a little hesitant to get my hands on a copy of the film but i still,look like this movie was shot in video and in fact there is no excuse for the lack of imagination
1,the only way to describe the movie is to have a good story and,the film opens with a scene of one of the men of mumbai
1,whilst the film is a little bit short it does n't,whilst this was n't a film it 's not bad
1,the only real gripe that i have with this movie is that it was made in 1980 and i did not like it,the only reason i even rented this film was because i had read a book about the movie and did n't have a clue
1,the first half of the film is a tad slow and it 's not as bad as the previous film,the only reason i watched this movie was because i had not been able to find out about a movie that
1,shortly afterward he gets a little girl in the first place of the film,shortly before they are introduced the police is assigned to get back on him and
1,however the movie has to go downhill from there,however i think it is a great performance for the
1,naturally they are not as convincing in the film as they,naturally i was looking forward to seeing the first film
1,a few of the actors involved in the making of this movie is a real pleasure to,a lot of things seem to go from there as much as the film is shot
1,as for me i have seen the first movie,as i mentioned before this was a good movie and
1,seeking to see him in the big sleep,seeking to see a movie like these in a
1,his father is an alcoholic and a womanizer,his father has to deal with him with a
1,also i think it has a lot of,also starring the very young robert ryan
1,whenever the two are reunited the two become friends,whenever the movie was released in the us i was
1,i am a huge fan of the original,i was very excited to see this one on
1,fairly soon i was able to watch this movie,fairly the movie also has a great deal of atmosphere
1,do n't waste your time on this one,do n't get me wrong i'm a sucker for
1,tom is an actor and he plays the perfect role for this film to work,tom savini is a great actor and his character is perfect in this film
1,but that is all that matters,but this one is not the worst
1,i do n't know if this movie is bad but the acting was good but the plot just seemed like,i have never heard of this one and i ca n't wait till the movie comes out on dvd
1,with the exception of the film it 's also very very funny and it,with the exception of the great cast the movie is a complete failure
1,i do n't understand why the director decided to make such a good movie,i saw this movie when i was in a class and it was a great
1,i do n't know what to say when i say this,i am a huge fan of the tv show but this is
1,but the movie is just as bad,but the story is a joke and the
1,there is n't one single thing in it that,there are many scenes that are n't funny
1,watching this movie is like a good example of how a movie should be a good movie,watching a film that is a little too long for its subject matter is not a good idea
1,in fact i have to say though that the plot is somewhat unbelievable,in the end this is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen
1,i have been in love and i 've been in love,i 've read a lot about the movie and i know that
1,please avoid the movie like this and if you are n't paying attention,please i say this movie is just so bad that you just have to
1,while this was a very good film it was a little bit of a letdown but not the best,while it is not an easy and interesting movie it is still one of the most memorable movies
1,first i think the director was trying to tell the truth,first there is a lot of action in the movie
1,that 's how you can get to the film to watch it and you wo n't be disappointed because it is so bad its bad it does n't even come close to being a,that was a bit of a shame since this was n't a movie that was released on video so you could see that the film is a little more than a little misleading
1,it 's not a bad movie but,it does n't make much sense
1,you know you are watching a documentary,you do not have to pay attention to
1,i have to admit that i have to admit i was impressed and i was impressed with the lack of realism,i saw this movie when i was 13 years old and i loved it so i do not like this film
1,this one is not for everyone but i recommend it to anyone with,this film is the best i have seen for a long time
1,the story itself is not bad the plot is contrived and predictable and the story just plain stupid,the only thing this film did n't commit about its release was that the film was released in the
1,but the film is also the one that i 've seen,but i guess the only reason i went to see it
1,i saw the movie on the sundance film festival and i loved it,i have to admit that i was n't a fan of this movie
1,upon hearing the title of this movie i have a feeling of deja vu,upon the film 's end he realizes that his son was killed by one of
1,i am not sure what that is,i would have liked to hear more about
1,most of the cast are all very good,most of the film is about the relationship that
1,at the same time i thought that the movie might be a bit too long,at least in one scene he is a bit frightened but that does n't mean that
1,even with a bit of a budget a good script and an excellent cast this is one of the best,even the actors who seem to work on a script like the one with the exception of a good old fashioned
1,congrats to the actors and the script,congrats for a few scenes of the film
1,the plot is very basic and the ending is predictable,the only thing that really got me was how this was
1,to sum this up this is a pretty bad movie,to sum it up it just is n't very funny
1,imho this movie is a waste of time,imho i have to say that i was disappointed
1,however the story is not as good,however the story was very good
1,my only complaint is that the characters in the story,my only problem in this movie is the ending
1,i do n't know how much money was spent with this movie,i think this is one of the best movies ever made and a
1,knowing that she has an eye of a,knowing how to do so much better
1,yep i know what the director and writer,yep that 's not a bad thing
1,yes the story line is a little convoluted and there are plenty of other scenes where the characters have to fight the other two,yes it is a bit of a parody of the original but it is also a very entertaining film that is quite enjoyable
1,this is one of the very very few movies that i have watched over,this one is a great movie for anyone who loves a good thriller
1,i think the reason i gave this movie 1 star was because i,i do not know why this film did n't even get released
1,i have seen this film a dozen times,i am a fan of the book
1,the movie is a good watch,the movie is a total bore that
1,she is the only character that is believable,she is the best thing to come out of
1,does he want revenge for her,does this have a point of view
1,of course the story is not that great,of course i have n't seen any of the
1,it seems to be the director 's fault to create some sort of tension in the film but the story,it seems that the movie has been shot in english so it is n't the story or the acting
1,this movie does nothing to distinguish the viewer 's intelligence and is n't just a good example,this is one of those movies that you would n't even have a chance on watching
1,the film was shot in a very tight way and the actors,the acting was horrible and i could barely help but laugh
1,to make matters worse this film is a must see,to be fair it 's not that the movie is n't
1,a good cast and a very nice story line make this a movie,a good example of the classic of the original and that was the result
1,the only reason i watched it till my friends is because i am a fan of the book and the movie was so good,the movie has a few funny moments in the end which are very funny and it 's a joy to see the rest of the
1,i am not going to go into the plot but i 'll never get a chance to watch this movie again,i would like to think it 's a good movie to make up for it and then i have a lot to
1,spoilers the ending and the ending was very abrupt,spoilers below the first two minutes of the movie are
1,he was also a great man,he 's the most annoying character in
1,this film has been released by several other great movies and i,this is one that is not only a vehicle to behold
1,he is a very nice guy but he does n't do that,he plays a tough role as the head of the group
1,it was n't the most memorable movie i have ever seen,it 's the only thing you have about it for me
1,many people who are familiar with this film should be ashamed for the fact that this movie has,many of us are familiar with the original the movie 's success as well as the book
1,as a matter of fact the acting is so bad i almost felt embarrassed for the actors and actresses involved to,as a matter of fact the movie was a complete disappointment as it turned out a bit slow at times
1,putting a lot of effort into the film that is,putting in a great performance by the lead actor
1,a lot of people do n't get it in the first place or so,a few weeks later i got to see this film as a child and i
1,simon and the gang are a little stiff but that does not,simon was a great character for the role of the father
1,but it is n't as bad as a lot of movies,but the fact that the film is a complete mess and the
1,the only redeeming feature is the fact that the,the story and story lines are very believable
1,i have been waiting for this one since i saw,i am not a fan of movies like this
1,all in all this is one of the best animated movies that i have ever seen,all in all it 's a pretty good film and it 's worth renting for its excellent
1,pitt does a fine job as the lead character of the film and his role in the film is quite nice,pitt is very good but he 's not even as good as he is and the other actors are very good
1,aileen has some nice moments but it does n't matter to her that she 's going to marry her and she is n't happy,aileen and her friends have to go back and try to make up their own mind but when they have to deal with the problem
1,the story of an ordinary man is very,the film has a lot of potential
1,of course it 's a film of the sort of thing where you can see the movie in a good light,of course the only reason to see this movie is because the director 's wife is in the film so it is
1,the story is a little thin,the plot is a little confusing to
1,john woo 's first film was a very good one,john wayne plays a tough guy but is not a bad
1,she has to be the most irritating character ever,she was a good actress but she was very good
1,then he meets a bunch of people,then you 're in for a ride in
1,all i can say is that the acting was good but i,all in all a very enjoyable film with lots of laughs
1,i do n't know if it should be that i have n't seen it in a theatre for several weeks,i was hoping that it would have some redeeming qualities but they 're so bad i do n't think the actors
1,i saw it when it first aired on television when it was released on dvd,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in london and thought that it was
1,im not sure whether i should not have watched it,im a fan of this film and i think it 's
1,starring in the cast was also the only one,starring john huston and a wonderful supporting cast
1,norma shearer is perfect but she plays a very likable character who does n't seem to know what,norma was a great actress but the film 's only redeeming feature is the presence she had
1,now the only thing that is good about this movie is that the,now i do n't think that it has a lot to offer
1,she was the first victim to a female who was in prison and she is a little,she 's a bit too sweet and too bright to be too sweet in this movie
1,without any doubt the best of the series i have seen the sopranos is a wonderful film to play and it is definitely one of,without much thought about the movie there was a good deal of suspense and the movie could have done without a lot of nudity
1,anyway if you 're going to give it the benefit,anyway this is an example of a great idea
1,for example when he 's being shot by a woman who was obviously shot in his face he was shot,for a start i could n't help but feel the urge to go to the bathroom in my seat
1,this one is not worth the time,this is just a great movie
1,in short i think that 's why it is n't that,in short it is an amazing film for all ages
1,the film is n't even worth watching,the plot line was a joke
1,i would not go into the theater and it is n't a good sign to watch,i am still waiting for something a little more dramatic but i think that this movie is
1,now it is a good idea that a good idea for a film is not to be taken into consideration,now that we see this movie i am a sucker for a great horror film with lots of good acting bad
1,the acting and acting are terrible,the film is a bit of a
1,that the plot of the show has no meaning,that is why he 's so stupid and that 's
1,he does n't have the charisma or the skill of a,he also wrote the screenplay and directed by robert ryan
1,if this movie were made to have been a cult movie it might have been,if you are looking for a good action thriller this one is for you
1,yet the film was a waste of time,yet they 're all in love with each other
1,according to imdb users that this is a movie that,according to the film the movie is very funny
1,however the story is so predictable that i do n't know how i missed the end,however the story is about a man who is trying to save his family and life
1,from start to finish and in the film,from the very beginning i felt cheated
1,take this movie out of your own,take the time to do this
1,we get the impression of how a film can be done in a very,we all know that this is an important film for a long time
1,panned by an american film goer who was a big fan of the original,panned the ending and it 's just as good as the last episode
1,although it was a great movie that i 'd never seen it in the theater it was just as bad,although it is very dated and a bit dated and the characters are not as good and interesting as the original
1,it 's a real shame that the director never got the chance to direct the entire thing in this one,it is not as bad as the first two installments it shows the great acting abilities of the characters
1,he is not the only one to get a glimpse of,he is a good man who has a heart attack
1,pierce brosnan is a great actor but the,pierce reynolds and robert duvall are excellent
1,its a movie that you could not watch because you have,its not a bad idea to do the same thing
1,when i first saw it i did n't know what to expect,when i was in the theater i saw it a few years ago
1,it 's a shame that they did n't have a lot,it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
1,what we get is a very boring movie with some pretty lame scenes,what makes it even more funny is that it was so stupid
1,this is a very good film and the performances,this is a great movie for the family
1,i would like this one if there were one thing that i do n't like is how much the film 's story has to do with the characters,i 've never read a book so well that there are many more things in this film that are so stupid that i actually thought this movie was a
1,i do n't care if he does n't want to be the,i was surprised how much this film did n't really do
1,strangely enough the movie is not a comedy or even a comedy,strangely enough the movie is n't so bad that it 's hard to
1,with his trusty hair he is a bit of a jerk,with the exception of the two leading characters and the story is
1,can they make a movie about how to make a movie,can it be that it is a little slow and slow paced
1,i have n't seen the original movie but i 've read this film,i was so impressed by that and i thought i was watching a lot
1,not even the acting could not save this stinker,not a great film but it 's a good film
1,i would have loved to watch this series again on a sunday night,i think you 'll find a movie about a man who has his own
1,we are shown that the movie is a real stinker and that 's why,we are left wondering how they could have been in a better movie
1,which is not a bad word to,which makes it a good show
1,i was very impressed with the acting and acting,i have a hard time believing that it 's not
1,it was a very good movie,it is a good story for those
1,its a movie you do n't want to miss,its a very interesting film with some good laughs in
1,the film has a few interesting scenes but the film 's story,the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence
1,from what they 've said i was surprised to find out,from that point on the action is just plain awful
1,sure it was a good movie but that was just me,sure it 's not a bad film but there is also a
1,also i think the movie is a very accurate and very,also the film is not as good as its predecessor
1,penelope ricci was a great choice for her and her acting is great,penelope cruz is a great actor and i hope they do n't take her
1,it 's an enjoyable movie that you should watch and,it 's a pretty bad movie but not bad
1,they have to make the best movie of the week,they did not have a lot of time for their own
1,and the acting is very good,and the movie is not very original
1,this movie was so bad i was,this is a pretty bad movie
1,soon after his wife dies he becomes embroiled in a dangerous accident which takes him to the city of new york,soon after they arrive in their own house they find a man named paco and his daughter and their friends are invited
1,for instance there 's the old lady 's boyfriend who has her head crushed,for example it 's all about the same guy who 's in the car for
1,i think i could n't find a good movie to play,i 've seen this film twice in the past 10 years and
1,my friend and i rented this movie and it 's so bad that it actually looks like the,my advice to those who have not seen it and who is a fan of the genre
1,we see it on a train station,we know we 're not supposed to be
1,they were the best in all this,they all get the best in the movie
1,but it 's still a nice film to see it has a lot of great action,but the movie has the same kind of humor that it 's a real stinker
1,while i think a lot of people think it was great and the acting was good,while i was in a small town in new york in the late 30s and early 30s
1,painfully stupid and utterly unnecessary the only redeeming feature,painfully bad movie and a waste of time
1,i was a little skeptical about the plot and the characters in the movie,i think this is one of the most underrated movies in the series
1,cut to the scene where the two main characters are the most beautiful of the entire film and they,cut to a few scenes of the movie are not really as memorable as in the first movie
1,certainly not as much to the story as this movie but if you,certainly one of those movies you would have to watch and enjoy
1,kevin spacey plays a great actor in this film who gives the,kevin smith is a good actor but this is no exception
1,she was n't so funny in this film,she does n't want to be a big star
1,it is a good movie and a very good one,it 's a shame to see a movie that can be
1,if you 're looking for a movie that does n't have a single redeeming features in,if you can watch a movie that 's a waste of your time and effort
1,it was a good idea but it is n't a good way to spend a saturday night with,it 's a real shame because this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,cbs should not make a movie that 's a waste of a time to watch,cbs has n't yet been released in the us so that the only good guys who
1,it is also a great film,it is one of those movies that
1,too bad i did n't pay attention to the story the acting was n't that terrible,too bad i did n't give it a 1 because i do not have a problem with
1,i think that this was one of his better films,i 've read some of the others that say they 're
1,why did the writers and producers have decided not to make a movie that is so bad that it actually,why does this have to be one of the best movies ever made in the history of the genre
1,as for me i 've got my doubts and i 'll never get my hands on the dvd for anyone,as for the other actors in the cast it 's all pretty good and it 's not a bad film
1,woolsey is a very funny film and i think it 's a shame that the film has been a success in,woolsey does his best as the evil but the rest of the cast is a fine choice for a movie
1,i do n't know what to say i do admire but i 've seen it a dozen times already,i do n't know if i was watching a movie but it was just too damn stupid and i really
1,rob schneider is one of my favorites,rob lowe was in this movie
1,but i think that is a shame,but it 's not the same
1,in the first half of the movie we 're supposed to feel sorry for the,in the end it was a very good movie that i would recommend it
1,william wyler is one of those people who,william wyler is a genius to play
1,it is not the most difficult to understand it 's a great example of what it is,it would n't be much like this but the film also is quite well done in that the
1,weight is a real classic for me,weight is one of his best and most
1,as it turns out they are in a coma and,as a result this is a very bad movie
1,let me say that this movie is not for me,let 's not forget to give you a clue why you
1,this is a film that should n't,this movie is not for everyone
1,being a huge fan of movies like this i have n't seen any of these movies,being a fan of horror movies i have never seen a movie like this before
1,as a result of the film 's plot the viewer is left wondering,as for me it was the best movie i have ever seen
1,was he a coward or was he a coward,was he supposed to be a funny guy
1,i think the movie 's biggest problem in the film is that the main character is so much as to be a caricature of himself and he does n't have to be one of,i was hoping that the filmmakers would n't have a lot of money for that but it was n't really a movie to me that i would rate a movie like this one
1,there 's a lot of the movie,there 's a lot of violence and the
1,normally the film is so bad it 's laughable,normally it is not funny it 's not funny
1,funnily enough the plot is a bunch of kids who go out to,funnily enough this is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,sorry but i have to say that it is an absolute failure to watch a good comedy,sorry folks but i think it 's a great movie to watch if you want to be entertained
1,i 've read a few comments from this website that the film has been,i do n't know about this one but i did n't like it
1,i was hoping it would be another great movie,i have seen some pretty good films and have seen
1,seriously i thought the movie was great,seriously i do n't think that it 's
1,in the end it 's not a great movie as it is a very good film but the acting is superb,in one scene he 's a man and he has to be a person with his fists and the other
1,for example the entire film looks cheap,for some strange reason he has been on
1,the only reason i gave this movie a 3 was,the only problem with this film is the acting
1,unfortunately there have to be a few,unfortunately it 's not a comedy
1,do n't waste your time on this crap,do n't get me wrong this film was very
1,throw in some decent acting and a good plot and,throw the film in a window of your own
1,she was not a good actress but,she is also a beautiful woman
1,melanie griffith was one of the best actresses ever to grace her and,melanie griffith is a great director and this is a good example
1,and it is not a comedy but it 's a very entertaining film in its own right,and if it was n't for the fact that i was a little bit disturbed and had a
1,anyway i have n't seen anything in a long,anyway the acting and acting is top notch
1,marlon brando is great as a detective who,marlon brando is excellent in his role
1,you 're not really sure what 's going on,you 'll be able to predict what is going on
1,the first thing that struck me was the fact that this,the acting is very good especially in the second part
1,this was a movie made for tv and it 's not the best of the series,this film is the best of it 's kind and the movie is a complete waste of
1,and i was a big fan of the first one,and the movie is just a little too boring for my
1,not to mention that i think it 's not worth mentioning,not that i 'd be able to see what the movie is
1,after all that he was n't even in a good place,after the success of the original bambi and the omen the movie
1,also the music was very very good,also if there is a story about the
1,still i ca n't imagine how anyone can compare this one to the original,still i would not recommend this film to all fans of the genre and it
1,drivel is the worst movie i 've seen in my life,drivel is not a problem and it has to be made up
1,it 's all very well done and,it is a very good film
1,indeed it 's not that bad,indeed there is a bit of violence
1,the plot was pretty weak and i was hoping that a lot more of them,the movie was shot in a time of the past but that was it
1,the plot is about a group of kids who go in search of,the only thing this movie has going for it is the soundtrack
1,this is the best movie i 've seen,this was a very low budget film
1,he is the first person in his,he 's also the real murderer
1,while it 's not the best movie ever made it is a good example for a movie to be a comedy,while the first half of the film is a little bit of a comedy it also is n't the most exciting
1,it has a great cast and a fantastic cast,it 's a great movie and i recommend it to
1,who could have done better with this,who can make fun of it
1,frankly the movie was made up in a small,frankly i was very impressed with the acting
1,the film is a bit of an action thriller,the acting is very good and the plot is very
1,what i got was a good movie with an excellent story that is so much better than this,what makes it so funny is how you know the story is going to be a bit more interesting
1,i think that this movie is a must see for anyone interested in seeing a movie in their lives and not,i do not understand that the film was n't released at the time of the release of 2005 's release
1,the story is simple the characters are interesting and you know the characters are all very important to the plot to make a story but it 's just,the film is about a young man named krishna and his younger son who are invited to spend a weekend together on a deserted road in italy
1,the only way to get a decent job is the fact that the movie,the story is a bit confusing and the acting is not the best
1,basically the movie is about a man who goes into the past and tries to be a little too hard to get his hands on it,basically the story is about an evil man who tries to kill a girl and the daughter he has to protect him from being kidnapped by a
1,director michael curtiz had made the most of the film the fact that it had the same cast as,director james toback is the only film that i can honestly say this is one of his finest
1,but this movie is a total waste of time,but the fact that the director does have a good
1,you 'll see it all the way and not even the most hilarious of them will come together,you know the story is set in a prison cell where the characters are so onedimensional that they do
1,the plot and acting are good but this was not a great movie,the only redeeming quality i can find is that they made this turkey
1,i have never forgotten the last one of it,i have been a huge fan of his films
1,mistake is one of the greatest and most underrated movies of all time,mistake to go and see this movie it is a waste for the movie
1,there 's a lot of action but nothing else is really explained or explained,there are two of the three leads in the film and the film is a
1,i 've seen the first film that is n't so bad that,i do n't know why it was such a great movie
1,this is the most powerful thing that is going on in the movie,this movie was one of those movies where you can only laugh at it
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and editing,the story is a bit of a mess but the acting was n't
1,the story is about a group of people who,the script is very good for this movie
1,i think that is the best way to describe this movie,i have never been a big fan of either of these movies
1,a very bad movie and it is not the worst of the worst but it 's one that i 've ever seen on the big screen with,a few things in the film you 'll love the film though is the fact that the film is set in a city of new york
1,the movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang,the film is a bit too long and is n't even worth
1,honestly it was n't a good movie and the ending,honestly it was an awful and very bad movie
1,and i did n't know why he,and what 's up with that
1,he is the most annoying actor of the film,he is also a good actor he was a great
1,but it is n't a bad thing,but the movie does n't work
1,as a fan of musicals i was impressed and the film was very well made and well acted,as the movie progresses and the film starts to go downhill we get to see how much more of
1,now if the movie was not so great that they could n't take a movie that seriously could have made it interesting and then they would be a little better,now the movie is about a woman who is not a virgin or a woman and the mother who is n't the person she wants to do and that 's about
1,the film 's plot is pretty standard and the acting in particular is very wooden,the plot is simple but you can tell it is a good family movie
1,if there 's one thing that i have to say about this film that i would n't give this movie,if you are a diehard fan of the series you will probably not find it very funny at all
1,fortunately the only one i have ever seen is the most ardent of the characters are not the,fortunately the rest of the film is about the only thing that keeps going to the end
1,the script is full of clichs,the film is a real treat for
1,these guys are not so stupid that they ca n't even get the girl to wear the same,these people are so much different in the future so much more interesting to me than that
1,rather than the usual hollywood fluff we can see the world trade center of the world and the people who are responsible for the murders the war and the,rather than just be a movie about a killer it 's not as bad as it was and the characters were not likable the story was pretty good
1,i would recommend this movie to anyone,i saw it on the shelves
1,only a handful of scenes were filmed in the background and the film was shot,only to get that money back to the film 's title of the film
1,a few people will be disappointed in the film,a good cast and a very interesting script
1,when the film is finally finished there 's a very slow pace that is not worth sitting through,when the movie was over you would n't have to have been a fan of the movie
1,it 's a good thing to see that the actors are in the background and they 're all so great and,it 's an insult to the filmmakers of the film that this film is a complete mess of any film
1,not a good thing for a film,not only does she try to get out
1,tellingly is the only thing that really makes it worthwhile,tellingly this is one of those films that i 've seen
1,seeing a woman who has an eye in her,seeing the first film is a good idea
1,the movie was a bit too long but in a good way,the film is very good but it 's not a good movie
1,after a while we are not sure why we 're going to see it,after watching the film i realized that it was the most boring movie i have
1,have n't they been the same,have n't we heard about it before
1,as for the film i have to admit that i enjoyed the movie,as a film it is a complete waste of time and time
1,sophia myles is also excellent as an actress in the,sophia myles is also very good in her role
1,i 've seen a lot of films and i have seen better movies,i saw it in a sneak preview and have been waiting for it to
1,get rid of the film as a film and then you,get back to your local library for the last time
1,we are also led to believe that the,we all have that the same thing
1,and the fact that this film is a remake of the first film in the past is a,and if it is the case of this one i 'd advise you to go see it
1,every time i watch this i will give it,every scene was shot in a time warp
1,a lot of people seem to know the story of the,a movie that i could barely sit back and enjoy
1,the only thing the movie had going,the movie was a little slow
1,i'm not sure why the movie was so bad i thought they could,i'm sorry but i do n't think that it is the same
1,for example the scene where the killer is killed is the,for a movie of this type i was very impressed
1,however this is just a fun film,however i was a bit surprised with this
1,but then again there were some funny scenes,but if you 've read some comments on here
1,one of the best things about the movie was the acting by,one of the best things about this film was the ending
1,the film is a total disaster and it is a pity as it is a very poor film,the script is full of holes and the plot is a mess but there 's a great deal of
1,and i do n't like movies that have the same theme,and i do think that the director has a lot of fun
1,now it seems that there are many different types of,now the plot of the movie was that bad
1,but i think it 's a very good movie,but the fact that this film has a good cast
1,as a result the film does seem to be an attempt to be an homage to the classic films,as for the rest of the cast i think that was the only reason i liked this film
1,the movie is a bit of a mess of a film,the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
1,it 's not just that it 's a comedy,it 's not even a movie that 's about how
1,wife was a man of the gods and that,wife is the best thing about the movie
1,itv has made a film with the,itv was a very good movie
1,in short this movie is very good,in fact this has to be the worst
1,i 've seen it a million times and will never ever watch it again,i 've seen a few films that have been made to look so good
1,it 's also a very good performance and the story is quite believable,it was just that the movie was shot on a cheap camera and the
1,it 's a shame that the film does n't come close to any other,it 's an example of the kind of film that makes you laugh and you
1,this is a movie that has a,this movie is a complete mess
1,2 the scene when the police officer is,2 the plot was a bit confusing
1,especially the scenes where the girl and the kids are walking around on stage and,especially the scene where he was a member of his family is very annoying
1,but the film is so poorly acted it is impossible to believe that anyone would actually have to sit through this mess,but that 's about it so there 's a lot more to it than that and that is a great deal of the
1,overall this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i,overall the acting is great especially the young victoria and the story line
1,yes there are some really funny scenes in this film,yes there was an occasional lack of a lot of violence
1,it is very funny how they make it through the entire movie,it is a great movie that will not leave you feeling comfortable or
1,it is a movie that will be remembered by everyone in it 's purest tastes,it 's a great story that will make the whole experience easier for a family to
1,so the audience is treated to an extremely boring and incoherent film with the usual clich plot holes and a few scenes which,so it seems that the filmmakers have decided to try to create something more serious and it 's not the best one
1,note the fact that this movie was released in 2001 i do n't want to ruin the movie with it,note to me that a film that is so much more than a drama and the actors are very well done
1,instead it 's a movie with no real substance whatsoever but it 's just not very good to,instead of trying to make us think it is a bad movie it is a complete failure
1,richard burton is the only good thing about this film,richard widmark is a genius as the lead character but the
1,i do n't remember it being so much of a surprise since it was a little slow,i was so impressed by the story and the performances that it became so difficult to follow and
1,it is a film that should go on and on,it has a good cast of characters that make you laugh
1,stomach candy is another movie for all ages,stomach is a good story and it is the
1,for a start of the movie the viewer is left with an impression of what the future was,for example i do n't think he has any redeeming qualities or a good sense of humor
1,the film 's climax is the first scene in the movie where the two main characters have been killed off and the two survivors,the plot is a little too simple and the story is very simple and there is very little to recommend in a movie
1,most of these are the only ones who are n't good in these roles,most of the characters were so stupid and the movie was so predictable that i
1,many of his friends are not very good but they are still very well,many people are not interested in movies but this is one of them
1,diane varsi plays a young actress who is trying to get the money to the top of things she has,diane varsi has a lot in common with her but she has done much much better in this role
1,i would like to think that this is a movie,i have to say it 's a good movie
1,in the end it is all very good,in fact he 's not so funny in his
1,it is a story about an american,it is a very bad movie
1,as with all movies this movie 's plot is very simple as we know that this,as a matter of fact there 's a lot to be said for the movie
1,he is the only one who is a good actor,he 's an expert who is a loner with an agenda
1,only in that respect for the fact that the story is set in a world where the movie is set up and is a bit too simple and boring,only to see if you are the kind of person who can do what life is like and what it is all about and it 's so funny
1,its not bad and i have to say it was,its a good movie if you like the genre
1,apart from that the acting is terrible the script worse and the acting is horrible,apart from the fact that i have seen it all the way through it is n't
1,the plot is pretty good but the acting is,the acting is terrible with only one character
1,essentially the script is a little stilted,essentially that 's what i call a movie
1,i have to admit that i have never seen a movie like this before that even the most recent movie is,i have n't seen a movie that has so many good moments i have to say i thought that i would watch
1,it 's a very good thing,it is very hard to tell how
1,however the story itself was so bad it could have been better,however i have to admit that i found it very entertaining
1,you do n't have to pay attention to how,you will have your own conclusions on it
1,maxx is a good horror movie that is very well done,maxx is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a
1,amitabh bachchan as the chief is an interesting character,amitabh bachchan 's character is a bit too young in
1,what 's with the way of making it,what makes this so great is how it was
1,gregory peck and his friends are the best in their respective roles,gregory peck was one of the greatest actors in the world
1,also there were several scenes which made me think of the,also i found myself wanting to laugh at the jokes
1,if you want to see a movie with bad acting and an even greater viewpoint you might,if you are going to watch this movie you can be quite surprised by the acting
1,my favorite scene is when a girl is raped a woman stabs in the head,my wife was in a mental institution when the first movie to be on the tv
1,and it has nothing to do with the story of the characters in the film,and if you do n't get a chance to see it you will have to watch
1,the story line is so weak,the story is not as good as
1,screamers was one of the most original films in my collection and,screamers was one of the best films of the 90 's
1,the plot is very simple and there are so many twists the story is so weak,the film also has a very interesting story about the human spirit that is presented
1,or is it a bad movie for anyone who is n't,or maybe that 's what the movie is going on
1,there is a lot of nudity and some of,there were many things wrong with this movie
1,i would recommend this film to anyone who has to see the movie as a child,i think this movie should have been banned as an adult film and should probably be watched
1,that 's how you can get a,that 's all i can say
1,it 's a shame that the film never got any better,it is n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but it
1,to begin with a very very bad movie,to make matters worse the acting was awful the
1,if the viewer is supposed to care less about the movie and the story of the characters and the plot and acting it does n't work,if you 're not a teenager and want to see a good movie with some mates and a few laughs watch something that is n't for you
1,it was just a waste of time and money,it is one of those movies so that it is
1,you do not need to see any of the actors in this movie to make,you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of the film in this film
1,as i mentioned earlier it is an excellent story,as the movie progresses we 're left wondering how he
1,if you 're a fan of the genre or you like action movies you should be able to enjoy this one,if you are looking for a scary movie that is fun to watch and you can get into the plot this is
1,yeah there 's some nice scenery in the first half but this one is really not,yeah i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was made with such a
1,check it out if you can get past the,check it out in the first 10 seconds
1,as a fan of movies this is not an exception to the rule of the film,as for all of the actors in the movie there 's a lot of action in this
1,i saw this movie on a friday night in london in 1979 and i was really surprised by it,i am not saying that this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life
1,that being said the story is so simple that even a little of the story is a little confusing,that 's what you would call a movie with an interesting story a good cast a decent script good music
1,a young boy and two young girls go on a trip,a great movie and i hope it gets more attention
1,knightley 's character was a bit too long,knightley and her husband have a good time in
1,i was surprised that it was n't a remake,i saw the movie at the amsterdam film festival
1,we know that the director is n't going to have a chance to redeem himself as the story progresses,we get the impression that it 's just a bad movie but it 's still very good for all the
1,however the script is pretty good and the story is very intriguing and it keeps you guessing throughout,however as for the rest of the story it seems like it would take a lot to take on
1,the acting is superb the characters are likable the story is well written and well done,the plot is simple the characters are stupid and the story is a complete waste of money
1,the only thing that could possibly be saved by the movie was the fact that i had,the film was shot at the time and it was very grainy for a few seconds
1,i would like to say that the only good part of this episode is the scene where she 's trying to save it from the shark that is n't as bad as the rest of,i think the film would n't have been made by the makers of the earlier film the film 's creators were more interested in keeping a straight face and the director could be forgiven
1,sinuhe also appears to be a very,sinuhe 's performance is quite convincing
1,well if the movie does have a few moments i would not have missed this but it 's worth a watch,well i did n't know what to expect from a friend of the dead and the movie had a little more going
1,a lot of the movie is about the characters,a good story and a very good movie
1,the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't too long and the story is very thin,the acting is good but the script is so poor that even the actors seem embarrassed and confused
1,i 've seen the movie a million times and i 've never seen any of those other,i have to say it is a great show that will make you laugh out loud
1,emotions of course are not that easy for us and our lives,emotions abound in a very different form as the plot unfolds
1,my only criticism is that the story line was a little confusing and i found myself wanting a good ending,my friends and i are both in love with the movie so it can get me to feel like i was
1,in fact the movie 's biggest flaw is to get the audience to,in fact the film was a complete waste of time and money
1,one of the greatest films i 've ever seen,one can only hope they do not make the movie
1,10 out of 10 for the fact that there was no plot,10 stars i am not a huge fan of the show
1,just do n't expect much and you,just as bad as the original
1,these characters are a real treat to behold,these days i have a fondness for the movie
1,three years later a film called the man and the lion,three of the finest things that happened is the movie is not
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen the cast is so,this movie should be required by anyone looking for a good laugh
1,the acting in the film is so good that you ca n't help it,the film has a very interesting plot but it just does n't work at all
1,he has been trying to do something that is n't funny and has n't been done,he is an excellent actor who plays a character who has to be the most likable person
1,my friends and i were all laughing at the jokes and the music and the story,my only criticism of the movie is the acting of the actors in the movie
1,charles bronson has an interesting cameo as the police detective of the town that has been sent,charles napier 's character is so stupid that the character 's motivations are not fleshed out
1,the movie was just boring and i think this is supposed to be a film for the whole family,the story is a little slow and it does n't make much sense but it still is good enough to
1,bouncing the camera to the camera and the lighting and camera work,bouncing with the wind 's face and the sound of music and you
1,most of the film is shot in a studio style style and the actors try to act like a bunch of,most of the time i was laughing so hard that i could not even get it out of my head
1,anyway the film is a very interesting and very moving look at life in the modern world in which,anyway i 've always liked the way the actors were able to portray them to be very good
1,the plot is a little thin but it is interesting,the film also features the same character as the original the
1,i do n't know about you,i am still waiting for the end
1,all in all it 's a pretty good film,all of the characters are so likable and the story
1,vodka was not the only good movie to come out of the gate,vodka is a great movie with a very good ending and great acting
1,existenz 's is an excellent film,existenz is a very good film
1,old fashioned horror movie with lots of fun in it the story itself is,old enough for a couple of hours in the end of the movie
1,ever since i 've seen this film i 've been looking through a lot of the comments and comments about this show so i'm not going to spoil it,ever since he has been killed by an unknown woman he begins to get a job of a man who he thinks of him and his son who is also
1,you will find yourself wishing that a little bit of,you have the ingredients of a good horror film
1,claim the film has a very bad,claim they are all the same
1,the film is a bit slow at times but it,the movie is a bit like the first one
1,if you want to see this film it is a great idea to get into a lot of things,if you want to see a good movie about a young man 's life this film is for you
1,so what 's the deal in the movie,so i did n't get to read any reviews
1,as for it it is very funny to hear how the grinch has a crush on him,as a matter of fact the film is not even worth the time it takes to watch it
1,and it 's also a nice movie that you should definitely enjoy,and it was the best thing i have seen from any of the
1,the acting is pretty poor the directing is terrible,the only thing that kept me watching was the scene
1,but the story has a lot of twists and turns,but that is not the case with the film 's plot
1,you have to watch it to understand the plot and what it is is a simple and thoughtprovoking experience,you have seen some of her films that do not make much sense and are not only a little bit
1,the movie is not even a comedy but a fun and entertaining movie with,the first half has a great cast and it 's a great movie
1,but i would have been so glad i watched that film,but i was n't impressed in the story of the movie
1,which i thought was pretty good and the actors were good,which was a shame because i did n't have the time to
1,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that,the acting and directing is flawless and the acting is great
1,the film is a real treat to the entire movie but it is also a good,the plot is a simple one of the most intriguing stories ever created on film
1,instead it was an entertaining movie,instead it 's not just a film
1,minghella 's character is very believable with his character and his facial expressions and mannerisms are impeccable,minghella is n't the only actor he has in his career that makes it a little easier to
1,there is a lot more in the,there is a lot of action
1,slight spoilers ahead there was a lot of potential,slight spoilers i thought the movie was great because it
1,so much so that i could n't get into the story,so if you have seen the original version i would say this
1,go see it and see how much you,go ahead and watch the movie instead
1,every character seems to be having a great time with their roles,every single character is played by a man that is a little bit
1,the only reason i wanted to see the movie was because my roommate said it was a great film,the story is very weak and the characters all speak to each other like they were in the book but
1,it is an excellent movie and a good film,it is a story about a girl that is in
1,there 's a bit of nudity and nudity,there are also some nice touches of the movie
1,following a series of events in an abandoned building the audience sees the film of this type of film and that it,following the movie with the main character 's wife is a bit more than an excuse for a very good movie
1,i do n't think the film is a perfect example of what it was like,i have never heard of this movie before and it 's not even that funny
1,this was a really good movie,this is a great film that i
1,it 's a movie of a kind of old black and white tv,it 's a shame that the film is not available on dvd
1,this was the first movie in which i have seen that 's been filmed in a week in the past,this time the movie is not as much fun as the book the movie was based on and it was n't
1,this is the only movie i can recall about a,this was the worst film i have ever seen
1,it was n't a very good film and there are no good actors at all,it 's a shame that the movie has been so badly remastered and edited with such
1,but this was a really good movie,but then again i 'll say you 're
1,back then there was a little too much going on,back then i had to watch the whole movie
1,tommy lee jones has an excellent role as a,tommy lee jones plays the character 's father
1,wilson is a good actor and i,wilson 's character is very good
1,they are all very good and very good but the film is not so terrible,they do n't seem to care about what to do and what happened in the last
1,the story is so weak that it 's actually,the story and the dialogue is very good
1,mainly this movie was shot in a small town,mainly due to his talent and a lack of talent
1,if you have n't seen this film and if you do n't have the patience to watch the movie for the first time you wo,if you 're looking for a great horror film go out and rent it if you love the original it 's a great movie
1,that 's what the producers were aiming,that was not the case here
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers,it 's not a bad movie
1,now this is the best movie,now i do n't know how to
1,despite a few flaws it is not a good film to watch,despite the fact that the movie was based on a true story i
1,the story line was a mess in itself,the movie has a few funny moments but overall
1,this movie is a waste of money,this is what makes it so great
1,i'm not a prude but i'm not sure what i do n't think,i'm sorry but it does n't make sense to the plot or character development
1,super mario 's character is a real person in every way and i think the movie was a bit,super hero is not the only film that has to be the worst movie in my entire life
1,the plot is so ridiculous and so predictable it 's untrue,the film is a little too short on its own and it
1,the film is a complete failure,the first movie was about the power
1,for the time of this film i would give an oscar for it,for a long time he was a big star and he did not seem
1,i have to admit it was a little overdone,i think it would have been much better to have
1,i was so impressed in the story and so many questions,i 've read all the comments here about this movie
1,so the film was made with a lot of potential,so i am a sucker for a bad movie
1,i do n't know whether to say the same thing about it i would have to say,i was very disappointed when i watched the film for the first time in the theater
1,it 's not as great or as bad as the others but the story is good,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's funny it 's just awful
1,even the music is n't bad but that 's the only thing that is,even though it is an excellent film it is not a good movie
1,they are all good and are n't very good or good,they 're not so bad they are good in their movies
1,in a movie like this you get to understand why they had,in fact he is the best character in the whole film
1,the movie is a complete mess,the only real gripe that this film
1,the only reason it was being released theatrically was because it was a remake for,the story is a bit slow but the film has the most basic plot
1,dakota fanning plays the role of a woman who has to,dakota fanning is one of the most underrated actors ever
1,apart from that it is one of the most boring films i 've ever seen,apart from the fact that they are trying to make it all seem very realistic and
1,the film opens with an old man getting a tip to his head,the film 's title sequence is an insult to both the director and the
1,yeah there were a lot of bad things about this film,yeah i know that i can only say a few of my
1,but it does n't have to go to the lowest common denominator and you should n't see it in,but this was a great movie and a great movie with some nice twists and good special effects
1,in fact the film is a mess,in fact it was so stupid
1,cramer is not a good actress but he is a great actor who is in it so many of his films,cramer is a young woman who is a struggling man to take her out to a small village in france where she
1,like the other reviewer said it was a bad movie,like i said before i have seen it a few times
1,i do n't know why people would like this movie so much,i think i should 've been a big fan of this film as
1,but if you 're an avid fan of the genre,but the story is a mess of a film
1,especially the scene where the hero is walking through a table while he is talking about it and then,especially the scene with her friend and the woman who is supposed to play basketball is pretty funny
1,there are so few things that i do n't know about,there were some good performances and it was a shame i was
1,i do n't think it is that the best part of the movie is the fact that the story is a complete waste of,i have never been a big fan of the comics but the movie is a great example of what the movie is about
1,i have never seen a good asian film before,i saw a few films with a few people that
1,after watching this movie the only reason i can see is,after all this film was made for tv i think
1,it is one of those movies you can find in the video stores and,it 's not that bad and i think that the actors are good
1,if you like movies about dinosaurs and animals i 'd recommend it if you like it,if you want to see a good film in a long time watch a movie
1,van helsing is the best actor ever but he 's,van dyke is one of the finest actors ever
1,too bad he 's not as good as it would be if he was on his way to fame,too many people who have n't seen this film are the ones who have to be so hard to read
1,justice of the story of his character is the,justice is the most difficult film to follow
1,it was an interesting film that i could,it was a nice film to watch
1,there is some good acting from him and the supporting cast are very good,there 's no doubt that this is a very very good movie but that 's
1,the unguarded and the dead poets was an incredible experience,the unguarded world' is the best of the bunch
1,i would have been so much more upset if the,i saw this film yesterday and i must say
1,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie,i 've heard that this was a huge success
1,who is the guy who killed a woman,who 's that knocking off a gun
1,and the scene with the giant critter is a little too much,and that 's the reason why you watch a movie of the same
1,there 's no plot to speak of either,there are many other movies out there that are
1,even though she is supposed to be a bit less serious in her part she is still a bit naive,even the most ardent fan of me is not a fan of movies or films like this one that have no
1,a good cast of characters is wasted here but that is n't all it is n't,a lot of things seem to be very common to the story and not to mention a
1,way too much of this film is n't that great either,way too much for it 's own good and it 's not
1,some of the jokes were funny and the jokes,some have complained about the movie as well
1,this is a very funny movie and i think that is a shame,this movie is an excellent film about the holocaust and it does not take
1,this is one that is really a bad bad bad movie,this was a great movie for those who liked those
1,the acting was horrible the plot was horrible and the ending was so,the plot is a joke and a little too convoluted at times
1,one thing that i really liked about this film was that it was a very low budget movie,one of the best i 've seen is in the film and a good movie that has some of
1,this was one of those movies that was so,this film is the worst movie ever made
1,far far too late for the rest of the movie to be a total,far too many things do not make the movie relevant for the plot
1,although i can only assume that it is a good film for a rainy day it is a great movie,although the movie is not as good as it would have been in this movie they are not the best ones
1,to me i do know the story was n't the same as the original,to me this film is not only a bad film but the fact that it
1,i was surprised at the amount of people involved in this film but the,i saw this movie yesterday and i have to say i'm pretty disappointed
1,the movie is a bit of a disappointment but that 's the only thing i can think of,the film 's plot is so predictable that we can see the director suspending disbelief at the audience and
1,please stop this movie from its own good,please i do n't have any complaints on my
1,although the movie is not as bad as some of the others it 's,although the plot is somewhat original it is very interesting and very entertaining
1,as for the film itself it was not a movie,as for the other characters it has no real connection to
1,besides this is an interesting film,besides this was one great movie
1,she also meets her daughter and is now a child who is n't quite as strong as she,she is a very strong woman and is not only a woman who also has an affair
1,my friend and i had to laugh at this film,my favorite scene is when a man kills a child of
1,this is the only movie i can remember where the director 's cut was in the film,this film is about a group of teens who get into trouble with a young girl named alice
1,in my eyes a film about a group of people from,in fact this has a good story a good cast
1,milestone also gives us an excellent cast that includes a very talented lionel atwill as a man who has no problems with his,milestone is one of those movies that i 've never seen before which could n't have come up with something so good
1,you do not want to watch this movie,you have to see the film to get it
1,the story is not bad the acting is,the film is a very entertaining one
1,duane and his men are in the right place,duane is a great actor but he is n't in
1,after watching a few episodes i was amazed to see this movie,after the film i found myself thinking wow this was supposed to have
1,they are a bunch of people who have a hard time with each,they 're the most pathetic and stupid things i have ever seen
1,this is a really good film,this is a very bad film
1,yank is an example of what the movie should do,yank is not a great show but there is a lot
1,we know that he is a little too ungrateful but that 's what makes it interesting,we 're told that the movie is n't just a spoof but a horror film and a
1,i do n't think they 're the only good thing to say,i do n't think the movie was meant to be funny or original
1,thank god i have a refund for this movie,thank you for giving this film a look
1,if you can find this film you can find some good things about your brain,if you want to see something interesting in this case you 'll love this movie
1,this film has nothing to recommend it except the fact that it 's a film about a bunch of young men who are trapped in a deserted island in a forest,this was n't the case with the movie because the director wanted to give a good idea that he wanted to make a good movie but failed miserably and it failed miserably
1,and if the film was n't a little,and it did n't make any sense
1,boogie nights is an excellent movie that has many,boogie nights is not a film to watch
1,i would have liked to see more of this type of thing,i 've seen this movie several times already and i can appreciate it
1,do yourself a favor and go and rent this one,do n't be fooled by the fact that you will never
1,i am glad i did but i really liked the movie as it,i have no idea how this movie got a rating of 3
1,i do recommend the whole film as a comedy,i would have given this movie a rating higher than
1,after watching it i felt i could have been better off watching it with the,after all this is a great show that i would love to see again
1,my favorite part of the movie is when the girl is trying to,my advice is that this is a movie of a good movie
1,o'toole 's character is a stereotype and he becomes the prime suspect for his daughter,o'toole and his men have to deal with a married couple who go on to find
1,nothing more than a series of flashbacks,nothing is explained that the film is a
1,he is the only one who can get out of his,he does n't seem to care about any of them
1,my wife and i were watching this movie for the first time,my rating for this film 210 i give it a 10
1,everybody should watch this movie if you 're a fan of the original,everybody is entitled to the level of a great actress who 's acting is
1,her character is so believable and the characters are so likable that you ca,her character is a real bitch and it 's easy to understand why
1,i have no idea how it would have been a good movie and had it in theaters as,i saw this movie and i thought hey the best part of this movie was the ending
1,it is a good idea to make a good movie with a decent cast of actors,it was so bad it was funny but the whole thing did not seem realistic
1,if the viewer is supposed to accept the fact that he 's a little too preoccupied with the film he might,if you like to see a movie that has the potential to be a good movie that is n't good
1,its a movie about a group of men who live together,its a great film and you have to love it
1,going to the cinema is a very entertaining one and the ending is a bit of a surprise,going to the movies to be a bit of a cult classic it is a good one to watch
1,simple and very simple about the story of a woman,simple to be a little bit of a joke
1,but this is one of those shows that i think was supposed to be about a,but the film has a few good moments and they are n't all that good
1,i 've seen this movie in many times and it 's still great,i do n't remember that much of the film but i was hoping it
1,the only good thing about me is that it was made with a lot of,the plot is not really bad it 's the same as the first movie
1,the movie is a little bit too short but for me it 's a fun movie,the plot is a bunch of random characters who have nothing to do with the story
1,the script is a joke from beginning to end,the film 's climax is a tad slow but it
1,410 the best of the worst movies ever,410 i love the movie and i like the
1,however i found myself enjoying the film so much i wanted,however as for the plot the acting is pretty weak
1,it 's the same type of movie as the other movies,it 's a good thing but it 's a bit too slow
1,our heroes would be more interested in the plight of,our hero does n't even know who he is
1,the movie has a good cast,the plot of this movie was a
1,and the ending is a very good surprise but the film,and then you get that you are not gonna care
1,allen also had a lot of good things going for it and he has some great lines,allen 's character is just as good as the one who 's in the movie and i really
1,i am a sucker for films that are so bad it 's good,i do n't want to be racist and say so but i think i
1,sex is the only way to make the point of the movie,sex scenes are pretty much all that 's done with the same style
1,i do n't know whether i am trying to explain what to expect,i am glad to say i have n't watched it since i was so
1,the story line is not bad and the actors do n't make the story believable,the story is very simple the acting and cinematography of the film and the actors is
1,and what is that all about,and what do they have for the
1,i 've heard some reviews from a good director,i do n't know whether or not to stop watching
1,there 's a scene with the woman walking around with her husband and his wife,there are a few funny moments but the movie is not so bad it 's funny
1,for a movie that was supposed to be funny and the story is not funny,for those who have never seen such an intelligent and thoughtprovoking story i 'd say this
1,the acting was bad the directing was terrible and,the film also has an excellent supporting cast
1,watch the film for its own merit,watch it and laugh at it
1,not the first of all the other great movies,not only do they have to deal with some of
1,her acting career in this movie is a real,her character is just a little too old
1,god bless him from this one and it 's a,god 's movie is a great film to watch
1,he has to be the most talented performer i 've ever,he was just as funny as the rest of us
1,and the ending was just plain bad,and that 's where the comparison ends
1,my favorite parts include some guy getting killed and his girlfriend goes to see it,my favorite parts are when the guy gets killed by the police squad with some of
1,the film does contain a lot of good acting and a solid script and some excellent special effects and a good script,the film is about the life of a man who is not a woman who is cheating on the death of a man
1,the film is a very interesting one and the director is n't afraid to get away with it,the movie starts out with a very good premise but is n't enough to get a coherent script
1,basically this movie is a mess,basically it is a movie about the
1,bottom line this is a very good show,bottom line it is a good movie
1,it 's like watching a documentary on a train and that is a rare thing,it is a film that is so funny that it is almost unbearable to watch
1,this movie is a complete failure from beginning to end,this film was a big disappointment in the first place
1,particularly the scenes where she is in the hospital room and the car chases the scene in the bar with the two girls walking around in a car,particularly in the second half of the movie it 's not even a complete loss of the original or as it is a very long way of life
1,too bad i did n't get it,too often the film takes itself too seriously
1,it is an absolute mustsee for fans of the classic,it 's just a little bit of a shame
1,this show is so awful it 's hard to believe that this is a,this movie is so much more than just plain bad it is not
1,she 's the kind of person that makes her character,she 's the most beautiful and talented and most of the
1,surprisingly enough the film was a waste of time for me and i would n't even watch it,surprisingly enough the movie has some of the most memorable moments i 've seen in any film
1,from a story standpoint to the final outcome the ending,from the beginning the director was a bit confused
1,for some reason i found the movie to be boring but,for me this movie is a complete waste of time
1,if you do n't want to see the first one then you are not going to be disappointed,if they do n't get a chance to kill people in a way i would not want to kill
1,well if you want to see the movie i strongly,well this is the only time i watched it
1,this is one of those films i,this is a pretty lousy movie
1,now i'm just thinking of a great deal of fun in my opinion,now i do n't think that anyone who is so impressed with the plot
1,most of the actors were just plain awful except for the fact that the plot is n't a good one,most of the movie consists of a bunch of characters who are not even likable enough to save a bunch of
1,end spoilers spoilers it 's a little slow but there is so much to keep things interesting,end of the world where it all works out as a good film to watch it 's a
1,i do n't think this film was a total waste of time,i think this film should be a lot more fun to watch in
1,the film is not very good either,the only problem was the director 's decision
1,it 's all about a bunch of teenagers and the girl who is kidnapped but they,it 's a shame that the director decided that he would have had an oscar
1,the movie is a great deal of fun and i recommend that everyone,the story is a little weak but it 's a great movie
1,let me preface that this is one of my alltime favorite movies,let 's make it clear that the film is a bit too long
1,these two are n't very funny at all,these are the kind of people we usually associate
1,instead i got that awful combination of two characters a very boring plot,instead i was n't sure who it was supposed to be and i was
1,unfortunately for those who have not seen it,unfortunately the movie is a total mess
1,damn it 's just another movie that is not worth watching and it 's,damn i think it is a shame that this show was released theatrically
1,the only thing that was interesting was the scene where the,the first half hour of the picture is quite exciting
1,it seems like the director was making fun,it is also a very interesting film
1,this was n't a good film by any means but rather a waste of time,this is the story of a young man trying to cope with her own past and
1,i saw this on tv and was amazed by it,i would have loved to see more of the actors who
1,hurry up in a world where it takes a turn or two or two and you will be rewarded,hurry up the next day i 've watched this movie and it 's a total waste of time
1,but the plot is a joke,but that makes me think so
1,in the movie there really is n't much else to recommend about the movie,in a world where the hero was not only a human but also the fact
1,it is an interesting story but it is a movie of sorts of all,it 's a shame that a film is not made available on dvd or dvd
1,sam raimi is not even funny,sam is an excellent character and his
1,the film is a complete disaster,the acting is good enough but i
1,i do n't think i could have made a movie like this,i 've been trying to figure out the real killer for years and
1,albeit the movie 's ending is a bit too long,albeit as a thriller about a bunch of people the only
1,jane wyman and the two sisters in the series are the stars of the film and i think that they will,jane and beth have a relationship with each other and they 're not happy about how they can go together
1,what is that so much about it,what makes this film so unique is that
1,he is a very beautiful woman and the two main characters,he 's just not the right guy to get the girl to
1,special mention must be to make up for,special guest actors have a great voice
1,there are also some great moments of,there is some really good acting
1,now it 's a movie about a group of people trying to survive a deadly virus and,now i have to admit that it is one of the best of the ernest adaptations
1,when i was watching this film i was a bit skeptical of the movie and i do n't really see it coming to,when he 's in bed with his girlfriend he goes off with the woman and he kills the girl who killed her
1,proves to be the most important movie ever made,proves the movie 's only redeeming quality to the script
1,if the film had a good plot it could have been a,if you have n't watched this film i highly recommend it
1,the first part of the story concerns the young man who is trying to find,the film has some interesting points that make the film a little too slow
1,during the first hour of the movie the audience realizes how to get to the point,during the opening credits we see how they came back to the states and the scene in
1,sure i do understand the point but it 's not enough to make a good movie,sure it was not the worst film i 've ever seen but the worst of the three
1,after all these years the film is a bit long,after a few minutes i was n't sure what to expect
1,ann sheridan and john mctiernan are the best of this kind of movie the two stooges are excellent as the characters,ann sheridan is a very underrated actress who is in the movie for the rest of the movie but she does n't
1,whether the director was the writer or the director 's the director should have been shot in the head in,whether the us government is responsible for their or even better the president 's son and the government agent
1,though the film 's premise is not entirely believable it is a very good film,though there 's a lot of violence and violence the film is pretty entertaining but it
1,3 the movie does n't have any of,3 the main character is a stereotype
1,it is n't even as a movie or a comedy or a serious,it 's a good film and it is a great family film
1,my favorite character was the father,my favorite scene in the movie comes
1,i 've seen a lot of other films and i do have a few friends,i have seen a few episodes of the original series that are so bad that they
1,i have not seen the movie but it is a,i would have liked to see this film again
1,well it 's the worst movie ever,well the film was a bit of a
1,as a result of the incident the characters and story line and the characters come to life to be a complete and utter embarrassment,as far as i have seen the original is not a bad idea of the original it 's just a poor excuse to make something
1,this is an amazing documentary on the nature of the human spirit,this is a movie that you can watch over and over and over
1,this is a movie that is very entertaining and a must see movie for anyone who is,this was a really good movie and i think that it was a very enjoyable movie
1,i 've never read a book that is so bad,i have never seen such a beautiful and wonderful film in
1,this film was a waste of my time,this is one of those movies that i can
1,the story was so simple that i had to see it because it was n't funny,the movie also has a lot of plot holes and some really good actors but it does
1,certain people have commented on this film and the director,certain scenes in the movie were so incredibly funny
1,geraldine mcewan is a woman with a strong sense of humour and,geraldine mcewan is perfect as the woman with the right guidance
1,a lot of people are saying that this is a bad movie,a movie that should be seen and appreciated by the younger generation
1,whoopi goldberg plays the mother in a very bad movie,whoopi goldberg as a drunken girl who is n't the least
1,the film has some interesting elements of humour,the only real problem i have with this movie
1,but it is still an excellent film for its time,but the real thing was that i was n't impressed at
1,i think the movie is a bit slow and not very good,i would have liked to have seen this movie on the big screen
1,i have never seen such a terrible movie,i have n't laughed so hard since i 've
1,will smith and his two friends get,will smith is a real actor
1,i'm not sure why this is a film for a rainy afternoon,i'm a fan of movies and tv shows that i like but not
1,it is also the same story of the same name,it 's a real shame that they did n't get this
1,the story is so simple that i found it difficult to believe this was ever made,the story is about the adventures of a young girl who 's a child who is married
1,i do n't think this movie was intended to be a success,i think it 's just that the movie does n't do much for
1,while a lot of the other reviewers have commented on it i thought it was very very good,while the movie is very slow paced and the story is not very interesting the viewer is left wondering
1,the movie has a lot of good action scenes with the actors,the plot revolves around a widowed couple of kids who go to the
1,star trek v is a very entertaining film,star wars was also a major problem with me
1,while i was watching the movie with a bunch of people and i thought it was very well made i could n't help but love,while a few years later this film is not about as much fun as it was in the first one but it was not
1,i am a fan of the first two films and it 's the,i do n't understand why people are comparing this to the original
1,please stop it and watch it again,please avoid the film at all costs
1,i do n't know what it was but,i was hoping for a good laugh
1,my wife and i saw this film last weekend,my friends and i are all very interested in making
1,the film 's plot is a bit of a joke but it was,the plot is not bad and there are holes in the plot
1,however i have to say that it was very well done and had good actors but it seemed like a,however in fact he has a very good sense of humor and the movie 's ability is too dark
1,in this movie the movie is a complete waste of time and money,in the movie we learn that the world is not a great place to
1,high school is not the only one,high hopes of a better film than most
1,on the plus side it is a very well made movie which is n't a good one,on the other hand this show is an embarrassment to anyone who wants to be in the middle
1,some of it is a little bit too slow and,some of the characters are n't really that interesting
1,while watching it for the first time i did n't get the impression that it is not,while i have to admit i did n't like it the first time i did not have a
1,how can i say it is a comedy,how did i get into this movie
1,i do n't know if this film was supposed to be a comedy but it is still very,i do not think i can even get into this movie but it 's not that bad
1,the movie is about as entertaining as a,the film was shot in the seventies
1,the film is a complete disaster of a film,the first thing that i liked is that the acting
1,really it seems to be on the same,really it is a very funny film
1,i 've read the book the first time,i 've seen many of these films in my
1,the acting the plot the music and everything about this movie is so bad it 's almost bad,the film has an odd and somewhat hopeful look and feel as if there are no other movies that
1,every time i think of it i will be looking forward to this movie and i am,every time i watch it i can say that i love the movies that were made
1,sees the movie for the first time,sees a film in my life
1,the only saving grace is the fact that this one has no real life,the acting is so bad that there seems to be little of the commend
1,it has a good script but i do n't think it could make,it 's like a student 's movie but it really is n't
1,this film is an insult to the intelligence of all involved,this film could have been a better place if it was n't
1,alicia kudrow is excellent as the young and loving daughter,alicia silverstone is the best actress ever and she was a
1,there are some interesting things in the film,there were some good points in the film
1,there are also some great scenes of the movie,there is an extended amount of nudity and nudity that
1,of course the movie is not about a woman but it is very different,of course i do n't think i 've been able to find anything to be
1,the script is a lot more interesting to watch,the story is very simple but there are so few
1,her performance was pretty good and the movie was pretty,her mother is also the daughter of the family
1,following the plot is n't the same but the acting is great and the characters really do a great job,following her and her son 's life and their relationship with them and their relationships and their love for each other
1,the acting was ok the directing was horrible the direction was awful the costumes were cheap and even the,the film is also about how the two men were treated as the first two in the movie
1,carpenter 's first film was a masterpiece of the genre but the rest of the cast did a very good job of giving this film a boost,carpenter was a filmmaker with the gift to make a movie about two guys who were in the process of being killed by a serial killer
1,better to make it more easier to follow,better still the film is still watchable
1,but i was surprised to see that the movie has some good points,but the movie also has an interesting message about the way it deals with
1,enchanting and powerful film of a woman whose love and love is a love story and a very good one,enchanting to watch and even if it 's not that much of a stretch the film is a total bore
1,while it 's not as memorable as the original it certainly does n't work,while this is a good movie it is not as good as the book
1,the story is about a guy who,the plot is a little farfetched
1,a young and beautiful young boy is visited by a woman,a movie that i would like to have my hands
1,and then it 's all about the guy who has no problem with,and that is the only positive thing i can say about it
1,she 's the only one who knows that she is not as attractive as,she 's a woman in the film industry and she is a woman
1,it is the story of a man who loves himself,it was so bad and it made me laugh
1,i do n't know why it 's called it the only reason i have,i would n't have been surprised if i saw it in the theater
1,in the end i thought i had to go through the whole film,in the meantime he is given an assignment to take care of him and
1,my wife and i were in a movie theater with my friends in the middle of high school who were in love with their parents,my favorite character was a woman who was a bit too stupid to be the most likable character i 've seen in a while
1,she is so beautiful she is perfect,she is not a good character
1,anne heche and michael gambon give an excellent performance as the lovers of the film,anne hathaway does a very funny but understated performance as the woman who is n't quite
1,the movie was very good but that 's about it,the only thing i can say about this film is its
1,the acting is n't great but the story is solid,the script is a little too much to bear
1,the film was made in 1993 with its limited budget and the fact that it,the plot is pretty good but the movie does n't make sense at all
1,as far as the movie goes i think that it was,as far as i'm concerned this is a great movie
1,if you have never heard of it before then you should n't be surprised,if you are a fan of this sort of thing this is a must see
1,sure it 's not all that bad there 's nothing here that you ca,sure it was the most beautiful movie in the entire history of history
1,chapa 's portrayal of the film was also a bit too long,chapa is a great character actor who is not in it
1,christian slater 's character was the best one,christian bale and his two coworkers were all pretty
1,you will get to see the film in the theatre in the last 5 seconds,you can feel the pain and frustration of love with all of his friends
1,later the film begins in an entirely predictable,later i had to watch the film
1,otherwise this movie was just terrible,otherwise i have to admit i did
1,she is a young girl and she is very well suited for the murder of her husband,she is a woman who is the daughter in a world where people are in the world of
1,o 'donnell plays a character who does n't even have much personality,o 'donnell is an excellent actor but his portrayal of a hardened criminal
1,this was n't a good movie,this movie is a must for people
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money,the movie is about a bunch of young girls who get
1,like the rest of the movie there is little more than the typical clichs of all the characters and situations of the film are,like i said before i am sure the director and writer have done a good job of making the movie a little better
1,other than the fact that the movie was shot in the same way i was in the mood,other than that it 's a fun little movie that i will watch over and over again
1,presenting the real problems with the characters and their relationship,presenting a new york city with an old flame
1,and if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll love this film,and there was a lot of people in here who are n't familiar to him
1,i 've always loved him but i really do not know why,i have to say that it was a complete waste of time
1,jan 's direction and acting as the villain is,jan 's mother is the only real person
1,now i do n't know why,now that i have seen this i
1,joe pesci is the perfect man to make this work,joe don 's character has a good time and it 's
1,after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie i was wondering why i did,after a few seconds you realize that the film might have been a good idea
1,this movie is a great example of what is wrong with the film,this movie has a lot of action and some scenes that were funny but
1,what was the point of making this film,what makes this movie a great movie is the
1,the story is about a group of young,the movie has no redeeming values whatsoever
1,but the film is also quite entertaining in places and i think,but that 's not all that is good in the movie
1,my advice skip this unless you are into the sort of thing that 's so bad you 'll,my wife was the first to see this movie at age 6 when i was a teenager
1,no one has a clue about it,no doubt that the director should 've had
1,see if there was ever a case,see this movie at least once
1,she 's also a pretty girl and a woman with a different attitude who is so bad as,she is the perfect choice to watch the movie and she makes it a bit more interesting
1,revenge of the sith is a film that i think is one of,revenge is one of those rare times and is very well done
1,the movie is a complete mess,the plot has potential but it 's
1,some of the other characters appear to be,some people do not think about it
1,now i know that 's my opinion,now that is what 's funny about it
1,old days of being a big fan of the genre i was surprised at the sheer lack of a,old west 's new age is a very interesting movie that does n't try to be too much
1,all of the actors are very convincing especially the one who is the most decorated,all in all i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,but the real problem with this movie is the acting,but that 's not enough to save the movie
1,little of the acting was good but the script was so bad it could n't even make sense in a theater,little britain has the same problems to do in the book which is a bit too long but in fact it is
1,the plot is a little too complicated and it 's hard for a child to get a grip on,the film has a great cast and it 's a great story of a group of young men
1,from the start to the end this movie is not worth renting,from there the movie goes to a completely different place where the film
1,what i found most intriguing is the ending,what is the purpose of having a child in
1,for those of you out there that love this movie,for me the movie has a lot to offer
1,the story is n't really that good,the film was very funny and had a
1,william shatner was also in it,william powell is one of my favourite
1,the acting and the script is terrible,the first is the music by george gershwin
1,i think it is a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd,i saw it on tv at a local theater and thought it was a great
1,it is a great movie but not the best,it 's the kind of film that makes you laugh
1,jake gyllenhaal does a great job in directing and his performance as the father 's brother is very good but he is very good,jake 's direction is not very high but the acting and the plot is excellent and the characters all do a very good job
1,the acting is very good and the direction is superb,the plot is so stupid that i was left wanting more
1,there 's a great deal of humor to this film as it tries to be humorous and ends up being a comedy,there 's no doubt the writer has to make a film that is n't so bad as to be an excuse to be
1,my wife and i were laughing at how bad it was,my favorite parts of this movie are the ones with the mother
1,everyone who has seen them in this movie will be very disappointed,everyone is entitled to a happy ending which i believe in the whole
1,i 've seen a few of the bad comments about this movie and it is probably the worst film i have ever seen in my life,i would like to see more films like this one but i can only hope i will find out that the movie was n't so much as
1,really it 's an awful movie i have,really it was n't a good film
1,then the next day i saw i had,then he meets and falls for him
1,i think that is the problem with this movie,i saw this at least a couple times and had
1,i was n't really expecting a lot of the plot but the movie is so good that it 's difficult to suspend disbelief at the sight of it,i 've seen this movie many times and i have to say i did n't like this movie because it seemed like a really good idea to be a
1,but it 's so much better and it 's still very entertaining at times,but the real story is about a young woman who is a child and her
1,with a cast of unknowns it 's a shame that the story is so predictable that they do,with a bit more work and a better script this film could have been a better movie
1,the first time i watched the movie was in a theater with the director,the only redeeming feature to this movie is the cinematography and the cinematography
1,later the film is a little too long and the story is a mess,later when i saw the movie the last mimzy came back and i knew i
1,and that is why the show is so great,and that 's all it 's good about
1,i have n't heard of this movie since i first saw it,i think this film is the best movie of all time
1,i do n't care about the people that do n't like this but they 're just plain stupid,i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was worse than this but this one is
1,and the scene where a young man is trying to get the,and the whole cast of characters were so stupid and uninteresting
1,other than the fact that it 's not even a movie it is just bad,other times he has a great cast with this movie but he is a good actor
1,so it 's not a great movie and it 's not,so many people have been there to see that the show 's
1,has to be a little generous,has n't seen the original movie and
1,the film is n't about as bad,the film is a total failure
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers decided to make a movie that the audience,it has to be one of the most underrated movie i have ever seen
1,and it does n't take long to make,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,i saw the first episode and i thought it was great,i do agree with the other reviewer who said that the film
1,this was the first time we have seen that movie,this film is so awful that it 's actually funny
1,as a result the film is so bad it 's embarrassing,as for the plot i could have cared less about the characters
1,epitaph for the movie and i will definitely say the whole movie does a great job of explaining the problems between the actors the,epitaph to the film 's title is the fact that you 'll probably be bored by what you 're doing in this movie
1,this show was so funny and i,this film has a good cast
1,and i have to say the whole movie was shot in new zealand,and if you have never seen the film then this film is worth your
1,trying to get to the bottom line of the movie is that a bunch of,trying to save the life of a friend of the marquis and her boyfriend
1,it does not have the usual clichs of the genre,it is a very good film but not very well executed
1,this movie is just awful it does n't even make,this is not the case with the other films
1,question why did n't they make the point,question that i would n't have to watch this
1,maybe the film was made by a,maybe he 's just too old
1,and there was a scene in which the two guys have sex in the movie,and there is the fact that the plot is n't a good one because it has
1,i do not recommend that you watch this film,i do n't know why it 's so bad i
1,the acting is superb and there 's plenty of suspense,the story is very interesting and the acting and directing are
1,all that 's said is that you can tell what a great director he really is,all the actors and actresses involved are very good but they do n't have much
1,i 've never seen such crap like this ever,i have n't read the book i think
1,there are no more than zero characters who do n't really care,there 's also a bit of nudity in this movie too
1,however there were a lot of problems,however i was surprised that i had not
1,beautiful cinematography from the original film,beautiful to see him get a role
1,no matter how many times you 're going,no one should have had this movie
1,so the film starts off with a lot of promise but it 's so much fun,so many times you get to know the characters in the movie and you can actually see
1,i think that it 's the most overrated and,i have no idea what 's going on
1,the acting is terrible the story is bad,the movie has a lot of problems and i
1,i 've seen a lot of movies that,i saw it when it came out
1,i think that if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy seeing it you 'll like,i do n't remember the last time i saw the movie on television in the first place
1,ditto to her husband and the other tenants who have been killed by the devil 's advocate and a little bit of blood and the beast 's death,ditto for the fact that she is so good as an actor and it has been in her own career that she 's the perfect actress to play and
1,perhaps the movie is supposed to be a little more realistic,perhaps the director did n't want to go on for a long
1,the acting in the film is so bad it 's embarrassing,the first thing i thought i was watching was a little girl
1,if the viewer is not going to get to see the movie i,if you are into bad movies this is the one for you
1,while the story is not the best it 's the only time it is set in motion and it has a good cast,while the film is very well shot the acting is good especially considering the talent of the actors involved in this production
1,the only thing i liked about this movie is that the acting in this movie,the script is n't as bad as i expected and the acting was horrible
1,the only thing that really bothered me was the lack of any of,the only problem in the script was the script and the direction
1,the acting was good enough the acting is superb the directing is great and it is,the only thing that was funny to me was the way that this was done
1,and it 's all very real,and the acting is pretty good
1,and it is the worst movie i have,and that was when the movie ended
1,i'm a big fan of a good story line that has so many good twists and turns,i'm sure the director and director have done a great job but this film is so poorly made
1,in the case of the movie the movie is,in the end he does n't get it
1,finally it 's a good film to watch,finally there 's the fact that the director has
1,2 out of 10 stars for being the worst movie ever,2 the plot of two main character 's girlfriends are not really
1,he has done a lot of movies that have no redeeming quality but it 's hard to say,he has a great voice and he has a voice and voice that fits the role perfectly
1,the plot is so simple and so full of holes that it 's impossible to make a movie about,the first film is about a woman who is sent from prison to a mental institution to her mother
1,on the positive side the cinematography is excellent the music is beautiful,on the plus side there are some good points in the story and
1,i saw this in a theatre in the early 80 's,i do n't think i could write a review about it if
1,i would recommend seeing this movie for the good of it,i 've seen the first three episodes of the series and it
1,it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but it is certainly worth the watch,it does however have a bit of a cult following and the characters are very well developed
1,alice is the only survivor who gets,alice is a very good movie
1,eventually we get the usual hollywood treatment,eventually the film is set up
1,she does n't even have a clue to him,she was also the only survivor of the film and
1,he 's a great actor and is a joy to watch,he was the real star of the show as well
1,the movie has no plot and no plot and it 's a pity the rest of the cast does n't seem like the script writer and crew of the original film,the first time the movie aired was released i could n't imagine how it was going to make a difference and to see what was being shown to be the last mimzy
1,i think the film is a good example of the sort and,i was hoping that the movie would be released on dvd
1,the plot is a bit confusing but,the plot is pretty much nonexistent
1,then the plot develops a little too thin for the audience and it becomes a bit too long,then it 's a bit of a spoof of the classic columbo movie but it 's still an enjoyable
1,this is the type of film that is so bad it 's funny,this is not only a film it is a very good film
1,alas i do n't remember the name of the title of this film as,alas the movie 's success was not as good as the other two
1,the film is very good in a way that is the first to be appreciated by many,the story was a bit confusing and the story line had some holes in it but it seemed
1,lucky man is a movie that is not,lucky man is a very good film
1,having a conversation with a man who has been a man to his son 's life is not even close,having seen it on a tv screen i could not help but laugh at the jokes of the movie
1,but the best thing about this film is the music which was so much more than,but i think the director was a bit prejudiced when they were not making it
1,walker does n't want to be a,walker is not a bad guy
1,they 're all so bad that they could n't even make a better,they have no choice but to show their talents of this show
1,more of an ensemble film with the usual exception of a,more than that i think it 's a good movie
1,young men are not the same but still they,young people with a brain in their head
1,however it is n't a great movie to me,however the movie does n't make much sense
1,there is n't a single person 's performance in this movie,there is some good stuff in this movie and it 's not
1,burns and matthau 's characters are very believable and there are many other memorable characters,burns is a good actress and this has to be the worst movie ever
1,there 's a few interesting scenes of the periphery of the story of the two,there are many good moments of humor and the acting by the entire cast
1,there was nothing else to watch and this is the most important aspect of the movie,there 's a lot of violence to be found in the film that is the reason why
1,ball has the most annoying character in this movie but he 's a great actor and a good actor in my,ball 's is the best way to describe this one as it has a great plot and a great plot
1,for those who are not familiar with the genre,for me it 's a pretty good story
1,in a nutshell the film is a little slow and boring for,in fact it 's the only thing that makes it watchable
1,even the soundtrack sounds more like a high score,even with all the faults of the story it is
1,it 's a shame that the movie was n't even nominated for the award nominated,it 's a very interesting idea but not enough for you to get involved
1,still it seems that the movie is about to be so good that the movie is not as bad as the rest,still i do n't want to go on the other that the unguarded hour of the film was not a total waste of
1,guests who are in the film are either very good or,guests who have to deal with the loss of war
1,hope lange 's character was more developed than the one that had been done before,hope davis is a fine actress as a woman who loves her life as a woman
1,the film is a complete failure,the only good point of this film
1,its so bad it 's almost like a parody on tv,its a very funny movie with all sorts of laughs
1,i was a fan of the original and i have seen this movie several times and have always regretted it,i do n't know if it would have been a good film to make but it did have a lot of
1,i think they were all good actors and a lot of them,i think you can get a kick out of this movie
1,now i'm just a sucker of the movie,now i know i was so stupid
1,unfortunately this is the most pointless scene i 've,unfortunately this is n't really a good idea
1,gets it right now if you are a fan of the genre and are a,gets a job in the movie that it would n't be a great thing
1,the movie has some funny moments though it is just a bit cheesy,the plot has no depth whatsoever or anything but it does have a bit
1,movies like that are not even the ones that come in the house of the dead,movies are not as good and this one is n't as good as the first
1,he does it in the first half and it 's the same old,he had the ability to make a film that was good enough
1,the movie is a total failure as to how it is in its entirety but the film itself is very good,the first half of the film focuses on the story of the lives of a young man who is a loner in
1,new york city was a great movie with great songs and songs and great choreography,new york is a film about a group of people who are trying to get married
1,it 's a shame that the only movie that i would recommend this movie is that it is not,it was the first of the three films in which the two leading actors were in the movie
1,technically i would like to say that this show is not the worst show ever,technically the story of the movie is very weak and the plot is weak the acting
1,there are two reasons why i love this movie,there is also a bit of suspense and gore and
1,in fact if you do n't have a clue that it 's not,in fact the film 's title was n't really a complete copout
1,filmed in a very tight manner the acting is pretty good but,filmed entirely on location in a remote landscape in los angeles
1,the script is so weak that you wonder why they bothered to do this,the film was made up of a typical story of an older woman who was
1,we all know it 's not the same,we are supposed to sympathize with them
1,and then they go to the party,and the fact that it was a big
1,it 's a shame he did n't have a bigger budget but i hope he will soon find the,it does n't really matter because they were n't going to be too hard to be a movie
1,it 's like they were trying desperately to make a film that they were trying to make fun,it is a film about the evils that the people who have lived in the united states
1,that 's how i got to know this was,that was the only reason for this film
1,that 's why i have n't watched the first one,that 's why this film was n't so popular in the
1,even if it 's not enough to make a good movie it 's definitely not a movie to watch,even when the movie is about a man who is in prison he is trying to solve what happened to
1,how did i have to watch this,how about a woman that is the killer
1,bert is a good actor but his character is too bland for the material,bert 's wife is a man in love with his wife and son of the
1,he is a very nice guy who does a lot of good things for the kids,he had a great deal of time in the movie and he was a very talented actor
1,if you have n't seen it then do not,if you are a fan of the series you 'll
1,the first is the fact that it seems to me to,the only redeeming feature of this movie was the acting
1,melanie griffith 's performance was also pretty good and she was pretty good in this and the,melanie shue was a wonderful woman and her performance was so bad she was almost perfect
1,however it seems that the writers decided they had done something more interesting with a budget,however it was a great movie if it was so great and i do n't know where
1,the movie is not very bad but it 's not the worst,the only thing that was missing was the music score the film was
1,i think that this film had some,i was n't expecting anything more
1,it was so bad you could almost hear,it 's an excellent piece of work
1,i have never heard of this film,i do n't want to spoil the ending
1,the film is an interesting story and one that should have been,the script is a very interesting one and is well acted
1,the movie is a mess of a series of scenes,the story line was a little weak but it was the
1,i saw a couple of movies about them on a friday night,i was expecting a good thriller and i really enjoyed this movie too
1,osama 's direction is superb but the story,osama is not one of my favorites
1,he is a very talented director,he has a lot of fun in
1,the acting is very bad and there are some really,the film starts off with a very nice twist
1,but it 's a bit of a shame that the rest of the film is n't as dull,but this show does n't have enough of the same problems to make it even remotely enjoyable
1,if it had been made by an outsider it would have worked better if there was a better script,if you like the original series you might want some enjoyment of this movie but you ca n't help but
1,in the end it is a very moving film,in fact i think the only reason i gave this
1,the only thing that makes the movie is the acting and,the first part of this film is just plain stupid
1,the film was n't bad at all and it is n't the least bit interesting,the movie is not as good as its predecessor but that is a shame i never
1,during a nightly scene the film abandons the audience to see the light as the story unfolds,during that time i felt the need to go see this film in my lifetime as a child
1,let 's get into it the story is a bit thin,let me tell you that i am a big fan of the
1,these are the only things i can think of in my childhood,these are the two things i did n't like as it is just
1,the movie is so bad it 's funny,the plot is a bit confusing and there 's
1,they do n't have enough money to get to the bank,they do n't get to the end of the movie but it
1,if you have not seen this movie do so,if you are a fan of the book and you
1,this is the first film i have ever seen,this one really is n't worth the price of admission
1,we have to be careful of the movie and not only the film but also the fact,we see the same old old man walking around in the snow talking on his own
1,one wonders what the filmmakers wanted to say,one thing i did n't like was the fact
1,a very interesting movie with a nice twist ending,a few of his films are pretty good but it
1,and it 's a shame that i never,and i think they 're all good
1,there is an odd twist where the,there is no reason for that
1,i think this movie is one of the worst of the year and a very good one for the entire,i saw it when i was 12 and it is still an excellent movie and one i love it
1,but it was the first movie that i could n't remember when i,but it is the only time that i will see it again
1,the acting and the script was awful,the film has the same basic premise and
1,from the very beginning i was convinced that the actors were actually making the film,from the very beginning i thought that it would be a little slow but it was
1,there was a scene that was a joke,there are many good things about this movie
1,would the writers and producers have a more interesting view of,would this been the only redeeming feature in the movie
1,and it 's the story of the man who 's been kidnapped and abused,and the acting is n't that bad but that 's not all that makes the
1,chris sarandon is the most convincing actor,chris farley is the only one who can
1,the film was so boring and the ending made my jaw bleed,the only reason i watched this is because they made an awful choice
1,if it were n't for the fact that the story was n't a bit predictable the acting was very good,if you 're looking for a movie that does n't need to be good enough to watch you do n't' know
1,the film opens with the two young women who get married to the men and the woman who has been married to her daughter in an earlier age in,the movie 's biggest problem is that it is not a good movie to me at the time and the end result is just a waste of time
1,1 it is so bad that it is actually,1 out of 10 stars for the movie
1,the script is a mess but the film has a lot of fun,the movie is n't bad the acting is horrible the story is bad the
1,god 's the girl who plays jesus 's friend,god bless me if there is any chance
1,songs are not the only one to listen to the music is not the worst i can ever hear,songs are a little repetitive but the music adds to the mood the film makes the overall feel so good
1,the first time i saw this movie,the acting was horrible as well
1,the film 's plot is a mishmash of characters who are not even likable,the script by david o 'donnell is very funny and the characters are very well
1,new york city is a perfect place to start and end,new york city is the perfect show and the show is just
1,it 's a very simple story about two people who are,it 's a pity that this movie was released theatrically
1,at one point the camera shakes a few seconds into the film,at a certain point in the film the story is just told from
1,the story is so stupid and full of holes that it 's unbelievable,the film is about a young woman named anna who gets married to her
1,i think that the acting is good and the actors are excellent,i saw that this film is a remake of the original classic
1,however the acting is horrible and the script,however it 's a very poor movie
1,from a purely routine script by the director and the direction of the first film it is a great story,from the very beginning of the movie the story is not as good as it was and it seemed the movie
1,a few of the scenes were just a,a great cast and a great script
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie is n't a good movie
1,some of the scenes in the film are very funny as well,some of the jokes are so lame it hurts me as to how
1,frankly i'm not sure if the movie is worth watching the first half,frankly it 's a shame because the whole movie is so bad that it
1,i was surprised to see it,i do n't know who wrote the
1,at first i was n't sure why this was n't a complete waste of time,at first you ca n't help but root for the characters to watch this show
1,there is no point that the movie has to,there were some great moments in the movie
1,stokes 's movie has a very interesting story and a good plot with the requisite amount,stokes has the ability to make it clear that the movie is set in ireland
1,only the last half is n't so good,only the movie is a complete failure
1,2 out of 10 because it 's,2 the ending is a joke
1,jack black is a genius but he 's a good comedic actor and he 's just a,jack lemmon as a police officer who is a cop with an interest in a crime
1,i am sure it was made for tv,i do not believe that any other actress could
1,i think i would like to see a more talented actress in the film,i do n't know what the director was thinking when he wrote this
1,it was an insult to the intelligence of cinema and this is one of,it 's a shame that they did n't make any sense at all
1,now that 's about the only thing that 's good about this movie the acting was good but the,now i know i have been a fan of a horror movie since it was made in 1988
1,man was it really a good movie,man the man is a good one and
1,disappointed i was not sure who would like this movie,disappointed with it it 's a little bit too predictable too
1,on the whole it was pretty well done,on the way out of the car they run
1,two of the most talented films of the last century are the best,two of the men and the female prisoners are in a motel with the
1,well worth the wait and the movie is,well this is a pretty good film
1,the first half is pretty good and it 's a great movie,the only thing that kept me watching was how they were able to
1,a great film with a great deal of humor,a good movie to me and you are the ones
1,mickey rourke and the rest of the cast are,mickey rourke plays the lead in the movie
1,i was expecting a movie that had a plot and a good cast,i am not a huge fan of the movie as well but the plot
1,you can do better than this,you 'll know what to expect
1,it 's not even that great,it was n't really a movie that
1,in the end this could n't even make a sequel,in the end it 's not the best thing about it
1,the plot is very good and i think that the actors are pretty good and the,the acting is terrible but the story is n't as bad as it should be
1,the film is set in a time where the characters are all the same characters in the movie,the only reason that the movie was so good was because the director wanted to make this film
1,i have n't seen this movie yet and,i was so disappointed by the movie
1,i 've never seen such a beautiful movie,i 've heard a lot about this movie and
1,back then the story is about the same old man and the girl and the girl,back on that day we are treated to a new world war ii film where it 's
1,the acting the script and the music was very good,the acting is very good especially the lead actor who plays
1,i saw this film in the theatre,i was n't expecting anything from the film
1,bad acting bad script and even worse acting,bad acting bad script bad direction bad music a
1,i was hoping for more and more of the plot line of the story and the story,i think the movie 's plot is a little thin and the story line is pretty lame
1,the story of the movie is a bit too predictable and it,the first time i saw it i was in the audience
1,unless you do n't think that this will be a good film to you and a lot of your friends you 're not a prude,unless you have seen this movie and you know i will be a bit more interested in the plot i 'd rather see the film in
1,all in all this movie is n't as bad as i expected,all in all a great show and a good family movie
1,it does n't even come close to being funny,it 's a real shame because i 've seen better
1,unlike this one the film is not a comedy it is a drama about,unlike the previous film he 's an american who is not a hero
1,this was the best of the three serials,this movie could not have been better
1,he does his best to make sure to,he is the one who loves him
1,while the acting is good i have seen better acting,while the movie is a masterpiece it was also a great
1,i 've seen a couple of movies but this one is the worst,i have n't been a fan since i saw the movie but was not
1,and the ending is a joke,and the story line is so weak
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's one of those rare works that will always be remembered for its rightful moments,it is one of those rare films which has its moments and is a bit over the top but it 's a good movie
1,set in a small town in england where the world is divided into a beautiful world of war that is n't necessarily an ordinary,set in the future and the new orleans city is a beautiful film and the film is a bit of fun to watch
1,being a fan of movies such as this one i,being the biggest star ever i have to say
1,i 've seen a number of films that are far superior to the ones that have come to mind and that,i think the film is not a comedy but a great movie for people who love a good horror flick
1,if the movie had n't made it to the big screen it would have been,if you like a good movie you can find some good acting in it
1,what i do know is that it,what was the purpose of this
1,that 's a little too much,that 's how you 're supposed to
1,i am not sure if they were trying to make a movie out of it but i just found it boring,i would say it is a good film with great production values but also good enough to give it a 2 out
1,the film is a real treat in every way possible,the only good part of this film is that it is
1,however this film is very entertaining and very funny,however i do n't want to spoil any of what
1,spoilers ahead of the film is about a woman who 's been married for her life and,spoilers for that scene i did n't really know what this was supposed to be about
1,the first time i saw him is when i was a little bit scared,the film 's plot has been told and done in a straightforward manner
1,it is the best show i have,it has some good action sequences
1,this movie is a must see,this movie has the best actors you
1,matthew lillard is a great actor and i have seen some of,matthew lillard plays an excellent character actor in the lead character
1,we get to see the first one and the second is one of the,we see a man walking on a train in the middle of nowhere
1,they have been living a life of the lives of the people who are living in their lives,they are so funny that you have to wonder whether it should take any more serious or serious
1,the first movie was a complete mess with the exception of,the movie is a complete mess from start to finish
1,technically this movie does have many problems but,technically the story is a little convoluted
1,solondz 's direction is not too bad the acting is terrible,solondz was a master of the art of art in this film
1,but the movie is a good one for the whole family,but i was n't too fond of seeing this movie as it
1,all the while they are all good,all in all this is a great film
1,although the story is not very good the acting was terrible the plot is stupid and the acting just,although this movie is not perfect and not at all funny it was not a very good one
1,best of all the movie is about the man who has an affair with,best of all is the fact that it 's a very bad movie
1,the acting is pretty bad and the script is not even bad,the story is not that bad and the plot is n't very good
1,i do n't see how many people who have reviewed this,i do not remember much of what this movie was
1,burt lancaster is the perfect choice for this role,burt reynolds plays a good cop with a very bad
1,we 're all so happy that we can see the whole film and feel like that is a joke,we are not told that it is n't a good one and that it 's a bit too long
1,alain tucci is a fine actor and his acting is superb,alain delon plays a man who works on a mission for his
1,all in all an excellent movie,all that happens to them is how
1,some of the scenes where they are talking,some of us have commented on that
1,i think this movie is one of the best and,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
1,a good idea for this movie,a good film is a very entertaining
1,it 's not as good as the first,it was a bit like a tv movie and
1,but it 's a good idea that,but i was n't really disappointed
1,all the characters are likable and the story is a real treat,all of these actors are a real plus for the film
1,i saw this movie in my childhood and i loved it,i think i would rather like it than the other two
1,but the movie is just plain boring,but the movie just does n't have any
1,so the movie gets a little more interesting with its characters in the plot and,so if you are looking for some good action movie this is for you
1,tight to the core and the story and the actors are all good,tight and the only way to make a good horror movie is to get
1,overall this is a very bad movie,overall it 's a great movie that is
1,i think the reason it made the point to be the first episode in season,i am amazed how many of the people on here have mentioned this film
1,and the fact that she 's a lesbian,and the ending was a little confusing
1,ok so i guess you 're going to like,ok so i was really shocked by it
1,benson is the only actor in the cast which is so impressive that i could n't help but,benson plays the role of a rich and troubled husband and is very likable to the viewer
1,the plot is so predictable and predictable that i ca n't believe that it was actually made,the acting is so good it hurts to see how much of the dialog is delivered by the
1,please do not waste your time on this garbage,please note the film 's lack of budget
1,worst of all it does not even try to be,worst of all it is the worst movie ever
1,i have n't been in a very high school for a long time,i do n't know if the movie is going to be good because it
1,some of the scenes are just plain bad,some of the other comments here seem to disagree
1,ryan gosling is good but is the only one who,ryan 's character was a bit of a stretch
1,the acting is very good but i really liked this movie,the story revolves around one of his friends who is a bit
1,i would have given this a zero star,i was a little confused when this show aired
1,i was hoping this film would have,i have not seen this one
1,gone to heaven and you have the ingredients of this film,gone is the film that is not the most important film ever
1,the acting is horrible the plot is bad and the direction is poor,the acting was horrible and it seemed a little bit like a play in
1,i think this is a good movie for anyone who has a heart or,i have n't seen the original so i wo n't go into it
1,as a fan of a classic film fan this film has to be one,as an added bonus for this film the film was a total failure
1,when i saw the trailer it was the same,when the film finally gets to the finish of the
1,or maybe i should have listened to the dvd cover,or maybe they should have gotten the right idea
1,scream is a movie that 's a good thing,scream is n't funny and not a great action movie
1,but if you like this movie you 'll like this movie,but that 's all i do n't know because i am not
1,another thing this movie is a very boring and predictable movie that is not worth your time,another thing i did n't like was the fact that they did not have a chance to make
1,they should have made a better movie but they do n't do,they are not afraid to show us a single person in the movie
1,this film has the best of it,this is a very good film
1,the plot is a bit thin but it is also a movie about two,the plot is so convoluted that you 'll find yourself rooting for it
1,acting was horrible the acting was n't bad the acting was terrible the directing was,acting is ok but this is one that i do n't really care about
1,they are the most beautiful of all time,they are just not funny at all
1,this film is a must to watch,this movie does have its faults
1,the plot is n't very bad either,the plot is simple but not a good
1,the story is so simple that i,the story itself is pretty basic
1,the acting was pretty wooden and the story is pretty bad,the first film was pretty cool but the rest of the film
1,you will have to wait till a few of your buddies to watch this film and you wo n't regret it,you 'll get some enjoyment from the film and the movie is just about as bad as you have ever heard
1,this is one of the best movies,this movie is a real stinker
1,besides a few moments of violence in the first half of the film the two,besides a few moments in the movie it was still a very nice movie
1,we do n't see him as the first person in the film and he 's a,we do n't get the feeling that the characters are too real for the movie
1,often the plot is so contrived and so lame it 's almost embarrassing to,often it has an impact but it 's just not very good either
1,another reason is that the movie is so bad that the only,another thing i can say about this film is the cinematography
1,also there are a couple of funny scenes,also the scene in the bar where they 're
1,everything about this movie is perfect,everything that was so good was that
1,perhaps i am just not sure what it was all,perhaps a bit too slow for its own good
1,grand canyon is one of the best movies that i have ever seen the actors are superb,grand hotel is one of those films that i have to watch over and over again
1,this movie has been made in my memory,this film is about the only thing you will
1,joseph cotten plays a tough guy who does n't want to leave his home to get,joseph cotten as the villain has to be one of the best in his role
1,i was a fan of the show,i have seen it several times
1,there is nothing here that 's a bad thing,there was nothing in the movie that made any difference
1,we 're not sure what it is all about and it 's all the,we know it 's going to end but that is n't the point
1,sinatra is also in love with his wife who has become the most decorated of her life,sinatra as the main character who has to deal with is not a good character he 's a
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie is the best of the series and
1,this movie is the first of three,this movie is a must see
1,in fact there were two things that could have used the movie,in this episode the two main characters are the most important and most
1,this is one of those films which will never be repeated in the,this movie has the look and feel of a high school play
1,the acting was ok and it 's a good job for a low budget movie,the movie 's plot is pretty simple but it 's a little bit too long
1,i 've heard the title song sung by a friend of a,i think it is one of the best i 've seen
1,not that it does not make sense,not to mention the acting in the film
1,either you need to get to see this,either way it was a fun ride
1,the first one was very well written and directed by steven jarmusch who,the movie is a mess of a movie with a capital d
1,there 's an element to the movie,there 's a scene where a young man
1,not much of a good story either,not that i do n't get any spoilers
1,another reviewer commented that this is not a movie about a man who is a woman,another example of this is that the director was trying to make a statement about the world
1,one of the best movies i have ever seen i was,one thing i liked most the other was the acting
1,the story is simple and is not a comedy it is about a man who lives with his wife and is trying to live the dream life of him,the movie is about the same guy as the old guy but it 's also the only reason for him to be a great actor but he 's still the
1,the first half of this movie is so bad it 's good,the acting is n't too bad but the story was very good and
1,do n't get me wrong i'm a huge football,do not waste your time with this one
1,perhaps the movie could have been much better if this movie had been made,perhaps he should n't be fooled to the point of the movie that he has
1,the story is so bad that it 's difficult to understand it 's a very bad film,the movie 's premise is that the director 's daughter had a mental disorder that he was not
1,there were some scenes that were just plain dumb,there are some good moments in this episode but this
1,this was a really great movie,this is a movie about the evils
1,however i did not see a whole lot of action at first sight,however i was impressed by the fact that the director did n't even bother
1,but that 's a minor problem,but this one is not for everyone
1,this is an excellent film that is not only about the,this is one of the worst movies i 've seen
1,the only reason i wanted to watch this show is because it 's a very bad movie,the film was a lot of fun and had some great scenes that make it even more enjoyable
1,what i saw was that a lot of movies were made with an r rating,what makes this show great is the way in which the characters show up
1,yes the film was shot in the seventies,yes the ending is n't as good but the
1,the acting is horrible the characters are ridiculous and the story just is n't there,the only reason this has been a success is due to the fact that the script
1,this was the only movie of this caliber of my,this film is the worst movie ive ever seen
1,well that 's what i thought,well i was n't expecting to see
1,it has the usual clichs and a few moments in the middle,it 's a shame that the film is n't in the same category
1,it would have been a lot better if there,it 's just so bad it 's funny
1,have they ever been in town for,have they ever seen such films
1,i was so disgusted by the end of the movie and the end of it,i 've never had a better film with such a bad review than i thought this
1,people in the cast were all pretty good with the script in the background,people of the age are not corrupted by the fact that they can only act
1,the acting is superb the cinematography is,the movie is a little slow
1,in a nutshell this would have been a little better,in the meantime i was looking forward to seeing this movie
1,i think that 's a good thing because the film does n't have anything to say,i have to say i love the film and think i will be a sucker for that
1,they were not so great in a film they were n't funny,they all get the same clothes and clothes of the same guys
1,famed and a lot more than i can do in the film,famed producer george ford does a masterful job of bringing it into a
1,you know you are in for a rough treat when a man with a brain and a,you can see the similarities between the two main characters as well as the other ones
1,i have n't seen anything that is so bad that i ca n't believe the good reviews,i saw this movie yesterday and i must say it has a certain amount of potential
1,actually this is the first time i have seen a movie i saw that had,actually it 's a very good movie and the story line is very solid
1,the film has a very very long cast and the story is a bit confusing and the plot is just plain,the story is a little slow but i liked the characters so much that it became interesting to watch them
1,i 've seen worse acting in elementary school plays with the camera in a lot,i think that the movie is a masterpiece for the eyes of its stars
1,but i ca n't remember the name of the whole movie,but the movie is just a bunch of boring boring boring boring
1,it 's like the movie makers were trying to,it 's a good thing to see it
1,i have never seen such a great film in my life,i 've seen this movie countless times and i think it is
1,they are a little more interesting than the,they were so much more than this
1,the film is a good movie for a rainy day and,the movie also had some very funny moments in it
1,totally unrealistic and a waste of time and money,totally devoid of any kind of substance it is n't
1,mostly the movie was made in color so i could n't believe it and even that is all,mostly it takes itself too seriously with no plot and the acting is n't that bad either
1,satyricon is a very entertaining film,satyricon was n't the worst movie i
1,this is not to say it was bad but it was just horrible,this is a great movie and should have been nominated for best picture and
1,a film that is n't even funny and not very good,a movie about a man who is not in control of the
1,how does he get his car,how the hell could a man like
1,some scenes where the film is filmed in the middle of a crowded street and the camera linger on the,some of the dialogue is just a bit contrived but the story line does n't make a coherent plot
1,after watching this i felt the film is a bit more,after seeing this movie i thought i 'd say wow
1,first off i must confess i had to watch it because it looked like the actors were going to be,first off the acting is n't bad at all and i ca n't say anything good about this movie
1,the only problem with this film is that it is a bit of an embarrassment to a story and the,the story is a little confusing at best and at some points it is n't funny or even amusing
1,breast and a couple of others have a lot of,breast is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,try and make this movie seem to be like,try to make it a little more serious
1,using this as a backdrop for the film is not the same as the first one,using it 's a great deal of talent in the first half hour of the film it
1,most of the actors have done the job,most people have n't seen the movie
1,as a matter of fact i ca n't say enough about it but,as a longtime warrior fan i have a problem with the film
1,one of the worst movies ever made,one of the most interesting films in the
1,even the soundtrack and the score are very good in the title,even the title sequence was very misleading and the ending was too abrupt
1,not only did we not see the world but we also,not only that but it 's also pretty damn bad
1,the plot is a little weak but the characters are likable,the story is so predictable and so stupid that it 's hard
1,i was hoping this would have been a good film if,i saw this as a child and i loved it
1,he has a knack for physical humor but this,he 's a real star of the show
1,i do n't understand why people would rate this movie as one that is only the best part of,i do n't know what it is about and it 's a little jarring but it does n't
1,spoiler ahead it was n't a good movie,spoiler ahead the film is a bit long
1,as a result the film is quite good but not as bad as,as a result of that it is not the greatest movie ever
1,they 're the same people who have no idea,they do not make it like this movie
1,the acting is good the cinematography is good the,the movie is n't even a good movie
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie watch a few good movies like that,if the story had a bit of the same thing you 'd find the movie a little
1,the movie was shot with a handheld camera which was so grainy and so distracting,the story is so predictable and full of coincidences i wonder where all the good things
1,the first thing that struck me was that i could n't believe that there was a character in this movie,the film also has some very funny moments but the overall tone of the show is very funny too
1,it 's a very funny movie and the characters are likable but the story line and,it has been said for years that he had a good time in this movie
1,the movie is not for everyone,the movie starts as an excuse to
1,the movie also has the same plot a few times a week and a couple of the characters are,the story is a bit too long and too much melodrama too much time wasted on the ending
1,other than that the movie is a complete mess,other than the obvious fact that this is a good
1,recognizing the film 's success and the most important,recognizing it is a film of a movie
1,all in all this film is very good,all of these actors have been on their own
1,why do i give it a 7,why did n't he kill his girlfriend
1,some of the scenes were very funny but the movie is not as funny as the first one,some have complained that this movie is a little slow but the film is not a bad film at
1,the story of the film is very simple and very very interesting,the movie is about two people trying to be the same person but
1,long time dead is one of my favorites,long enough to get a little over the top
1,this movie is just so awful,this is the only movie i saw
1,he does not have to take the time to get into,he is an excellent actor who is a fine actor
1,i think this movie is one of the best,i was expecting a lot from the movie
1,chiba plays the character of a hitman who is determined to kill himself and his family,chiba gives an excellent performance as the young man who befriends the beautiful barbara hershey who plays
1,the movie was so horrible that they could not have had it been a lot better,the plot is very simple and it is a story that is so realistic that you ca
1,blaine is a fine actor but his performance is so good that,blaine is an excellent actor and the supporting cast are great
1,as i said before the film is a bit slow and drags in a bit too long to,as far as the film goes there is still some very good stuff in the entire movie
1,it is a pity that they did n't give up the chance to develop their character,it is the worst of it 's low budget but that is not what this movie is
1,i have never seen such bad actors in their life as,i have no clue what this film was all about
1,all the other movies are great,all these people seem to have a
1,for all of the above the film is just as bad and worse as the book which is not,for the first half hour it is a very slow paced story that is not really worth seeing
1,i have seen the film dozens of times and i have never been tired of watching it,i have never seen the film version of a classic film nor the fact that this film is
1,if you have to watch the dvd version of the story to understand the story of,if you want to watch a film that is n't so much fun to watch
1,a few years ago it was made for the big,a very enjoyable movie but not a good thing
1,also the acting was good and i was surprised that the director had never,also it does n't make the slightest bit believable for me to watch
1,it is not only a movie of the week but also a lot of the film 's themes of love and love,it is a very good movie and i hope that the director will get a chance to release it on dvd
1,i 've seen this movie twice and i have to say i loved it,i saw a few movies about the movie and i was impressed and disappointed i
1,look like it was shot in the middle of an abandoned building and the whole thing looks like,look at the scene where the woman is talking about the death and the woman she loves
1,instead it is a movie that is not even close to being the best of the series,instead of a bad guy we are given one of the most horrible examples of his career
1,so the movie is just as bad,so many of them are very bad but
1,but then again it 's all pretty funny but that 's about it,but the story is about a group of kids who are sent to prison
1,i was a bit surprised to find a few good actors here but i really liked the movie,i was surprised to learn that the film was shot in color and it looks like a bunch of
1,nanon is a beautiful woman who is a very strong character,nanon and the stranger are the best in this movie
1,sissy 's performance does the job and the,sissy spacek is excellent as the woman
1,oshii is a genius to behold and is a fine filmmaker in this field,oshii is a genius but this film is a total waste of time
1,i have to say it was a great idea,i have seen it several times since and i still
1,a great movie and a mustsee for all,a good example is how the film is shot
1,babbage was the one that made it,babbage is the leader for the cia to
1,you know it 's about time you,you know what 's going on
1,the only real flaw is the fact that there is no suspense whatsoever,the movie is n't as bad as some of the others but the story
1,but if you like the first film you will love this,but this is a movie that will make you wish you had
1,so much of the action is spent,so the film is a total waste of
1,he is not as good as in,he has the right to die
1,veiled to the point of being a complete waste of time,veiled to the point of exhaustion that is n't necessarily the case
1,later on we get to see a woman who looks like she 's just wandered around in a forest,later the film is full of bad acting and the only good part of this movie is that it is
1,this is not a good film but it has a few good,this movie should have been a little too far too long
1,she is an actress who is always in love,she is also one of my favorite actresses
1,launched from the same year for eight years i have to say that i was a little skeptical to see it,launched this movie by a friend of mine a fan of the original and i have to say the title song is
1,sorry i am so bored with my assessment of what i 've seen in,sorry i ca n't even remember that one thing is missing the point
1,phantasm iv is another great film that,phantasm is a very entertaining film
1,while a lot of the scenes involve a few characters the movie is not as funny as it is in the original,while a little slow paced and very violent at times the pacing is slow and the film suffers from a few moments of
1,a very interesting and interesting story of a man who is born in a,a few things are done differently here and the film becomes increasingly predictable
1,its not as good as the first film but it 's,its a film of a certain kind of it is
1,the acting is superb and the story is good,the story is not a typical movie like that one
1,for the first time in the series there is an explanation to the whole,for the most part the acting is terrible and the script is horrible
1,there is nothing that makes a good movie and,there were several great parts in this film
1,her character is n't even likable and i did n't think she was a good actress,her performance is a bit stilted but it 's hard for me to imagine her acting skills
1,i have never seen the movie but it has to be said that this show is one of,i was very impressed with the movie but in the end the movie was just too boring
1,funny moments are when you see this movie you can really tell that,funny how the story develops a little bit more to its predecessor
1,compare it to any other movie,compare this to the other films
1,the film starts out with a man trying to save his life but the way he gets back is the story of two men who fall in love,the only good thing about this film was the scenery and costumes that were so well made they were n't just used to convey the film 's quality
1,if you are a fan of the series watch this episode and you will be hooked,if you 're a diehard fan of the genre of horror movies then you might be right
1,what is more a great piece of art,what a waste of time and time
1,but the film is a great example of how a movie can go wrong,but the real star of the film is that it is a complete departure from
1,if you are looking for a fun horror movie do n't bother with this,if you want a movie like the first one you 'll be disappointed
1,there 's no plot to this film either,there is no real reason to see this movie
1,i do n't think that this film is anything but a masterpiece,i saw the film on the cover but was n't prepared to let
1,the story is about a young man who is visited with his mother and two daughters who are searching for their son,the film does boast a few good moments in which the viewer is privy to the scene where the three main characters are
1,it 's a very good movie but the movie just does n't have enough good things,it 's not the first movie to be good but it is definitely worth watching
1,a few things happened to me that i would never watch again,a good deal of fun but it 's just so funny
1,the film is not a total waste of time,the plot of the film is n't a mystery but
1,they do n't have enough money to get to know that,they have the most important of all the characters in it
1,is there any point to this movie or just to make a movie,is this a movie or something because i have n't read the novel
1,however it does n't seem as if the director and writer had any,however the film has a very long and boring feel to it
1,i saw it in an old theater theater in the middle of nowhere,i think this is what i saw and not because i liked that movie
1,a lot of people have said that they are not a movie,a good cast of good actors and the cast of this film are
1,it does n't have much of an explanation for,it 's a very funny and sad film
1,but the film is not about a man who can be,but it is also a very interesting story to watch
1,i saw this movie at a theater in washington dc,i have to say this is a great movie for the
1,as it is this movie is a total waste of time,as a child of his parents his son was not quite a
1,a lot like this film is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time,a very simple and touching story and an excellent cast that includes a very strong performance by david
1,with this movie it was just as funny as anything i have ever seen,with a supposed budget of about 5000000 for this film it 's not even that
1,orson welles 's character is a very complex character,orson grant is great as a villain who has a
1,but this one just has n't gotten a good rap score,but i think that it has to do with the fact that
1,so much for it 's good and it 's really good,so what do you expect from a movie that is so bad
1,in the end it is a film that is n't worth watching,in the end it is the same kind of film you 've read
1,it was just as bad as the other bad,it is n't the greatest movie that i have ever
1,it is an interesting film to watch with the hope that the film would,it is also an interesting film to watch for the love of god
1,but it is n't a good movie and the acting is so bad that it,but then the show started to drag downhill when the first season was aired
1,shahid has a good time playing a character he plays and he has great charisma and a lot of his voice,shahid is an excellent film and i hope it will be a success for anyone who enjoys to watch films
1,she has a very beautiful voice,she also had a very strong supporting
1,we see the two brothers and the other people who are in love with a girl named carolyn,we do n't really care about the characters in this movie because they are too stupid to play characters
1,tim robbins is excellent as the conflicted wife who has the heart of,tim conway 's performance here has nothing to do with the film
1,the movie also features some very beautiful sequences and the best part of this movie,the film was shot in an old studio style and was very cheaply executed
1,chose to be a good movie,chose to be the best movie ever
1,of course the main character is a young woman who is a struggling and very rich man with a lot,of course there are a few moments that are very effective but the rest of us are not afraid
1,seen in a movie that was so bad that,seen on the dvd cover is the same
1,i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes action and comedy movies,i have no clue that he 's in his place and the film is
1,you do n't even have to be one of those who can find a better person who can,you have to watch the movie and you wo n't care much for the characters or story
1,we see that the man is a woman but he is not the least bit of that it is about,we are also shown as the main character in the family who has a lot of sex for him
1,from a technical standpoint this one is a stinker,from the opening sequence we see a group of teens
1,while i ca n't help but wonder why this film has been made,while the film was shot in the same way it was shot in black
1,it was a nice show for those involved in it 's own way,it is an excellent film and one that has been overlooked by many of
1,the movie starts out with a couple of kids trying to get the kids,the story is a little convoluted but it 's also a great movie
1,i do n't think anyone will ever see any of the,i have never seen such a terrible film as this
1,chabrol has created a film that has a profound message about the nature of,chabrol 's film is the perfect example of how a film could be
1,oh well the first thing that struck me in,oh i 've never heard of this movie
1,mishima was a good film to watch,mishima was one of the most influential movies
1,even though the movie is n't as good as the other two,even the most ardent fans of the genre will be disappointed
1,yet the story was so predictable,yet the movie is so much more
1,i am a huge fan of this series and i have never seen such a good movie as it did,i do believe that they did n't have the best lines in the entire movie and it was n't funny
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and money,this movie is just plain stupid and i did n't have
1,i would recommend seeing this movie at least to see a different film,i do n't know whether it 's all the way it was supposed to
1,and i have to say that i was a little,and that was the last line of the movie
1,yet the film has a lot to recommend it,yet this is one of my favourite horror movies
1,the movie is just plain awful,the film was so poorly done that
1,oh and a few scenes that seem to be the only one who has the ability to notice the scene,oh well this is n't a movie that is meant to be a drama about an alien who has a heart
1,it 's a very nice film with some of the best performances in the movie and,it has the same kind of humour and a little bit more of the same
1,in the first movie he was a good guy who could have,in this one there is the odd thing about the movie
1,i think the reason this movie is so amazing is because of the way they act and how they do it,i was n't sure who the real culprit was or what happened to him when she was the first to die for
1,along with a few minor problems the film has its flaws the viewer is led to,along with the great cast and a good script there is a lot of action
1,a very interesting premise but that is not what it is,a lot of the film has been cut out from the original
1,well i 've been in a few of my friends in the movie and i think i have seen it in a dozen different ways,well i did n't really get the idea that the movie was going to have been made by a bunch of people who have n't seen
1,the story is a mess that has been told and so much more than it can,the film opens with a group of friends who are trapped in a small apartment in their
1,the movie was n't so great but it still was a good movie,the first time i saw it was in the theater i was in tears
1,the plot is very interesting but it 's just plain,the film is about the power of the characters
1,in this movie we know that the director is trying to,in fact there 's no character development no character development
1,2 i have n't heard that much about it is that the movie has,2 the main plot is pretty lame and the movie is so stupid
1,oh and the final verdict to the original film is that the,oh yes it 's the best movie i have ever seen
1,it was not the best film in the world but it was a very nice experience,it was a very funny scene but i ca n't really say that this was a bad
1,we are also introduced to some pretty good acting,we have a couple of scenes with the actors and
1,however i did n't care for the,however this is an excellent movie
1,almost every episode is full of suspense the story is so predictable it 's unbelievable,almost every time he gets on the train the only person is allowed to kill him
1,it is a story of love and passion in which,it is a film that is not for everyone
1,the plot was so thin i could have done without any of the other characters and the acting was horrible,the movie is about a bunch of men who want a good guy in the form of a man who is
1,i am so excited to see it again i do n't know why,i have not seen it in a while but i have seen it
1,great acting great script great acting great music and a very good soundtrack,great movie about a guy who wants to get to his house where he
1,the script is a little weak and the story itself,the film opens with a bang on an elevator
1,one thing that i found interesting was the way that they were,one of the most underrated films that i have ever seen
1,the only good scene was that when a guy in the car crash asks her friends to see the woman and they are shooting each other to a chair on a wall,the story of the story is simple in the way it deals with a young and naive man who 's trying to find his father but who is unwilling to accept his life
1,no wonder it 's the best movie in the world,no it 's all for a couple of chuckles a lot
1,this is one of the best movies,this show is a real shame
1,ivanhoe and a lot of other films are the most controversial ones i 've seen,ivanhoe is a wonderful film about a man 's life and his love for his son
1,mystery is a little bit more interesting than that of the other two movies,mystery science theater 3000 and i was n't a bit surprised at all the plot
1,to begin with a few of the scenes in the film are the best,to make a movie with a little bit of nudity i could n't really sit
1,i 've seen a few of these movies with a bit of humor but i do,i would love to see another movie that is as funny as a good one
1,everything else is just so good and that 's the reason why,everything about this film is great and the acting is superb
1,i'm not sure why i did n't like the story and the way it was filmed,i'm not sure if the movie was intentional in parts or the acting was a little too
1,the movie has no sense of suspense,the film is a very good film
1,the story is n't all that bad though it does n't make sense at all,the story of a woman who works as a stripper in the west and has her
1,this film is not for everyone,this is the best of all of
1,asia had to be a bit of a threat,asia is a great example of how the film can
1,some of them are not funny,some of these scenes are very well
1,but this is the first of the series that,but it is the best of the three
1,i saw the film at the amsterdam film festival and was very impressed with the story and the acting,i 've always thought that it would 've been a little better but it is still a pretty good film
1,it 's not even bad for a couple of hours,it 's a very simple movie with some of the best
1,ms smith is a young lady with,ms smith has no talent whatsoever
1,these are some of my favorites and i think they should have done the same things that were,these guys are in their mid 20s and are so obviously not that the audience is treated
1,i am glad to have a copy of a movie that i would have to be seen as i am the,i saw this film when it was broadcast in 1995 it was a great movie with a very good soundtrack
1,i am sure there is some good reason for,i was n't even sure what to do
1,just like most movies i have seen i do n't want to be so harsh and i just did not like the ending,just because the movie 's title does not work as a means of being a movie is a testament to the original and i
1,the film 's plot follows a woman who 's trying to solve an accident and then she goes to a small,the acting is terrible with the main exception of the bad acting and the script and i mean the acting
1,both films do not make much sense as to what the director 's vision means to be a film about a dysfunctional family,both films are the first of the same ilk to the point that it 's a bit hard to find anything more to say
1,i do n't know how the story of these characters would make a movie that they could not have had,i was surprised that they made a name to play this movie as a horror movie in that it 's a
1,the acting is terrible but it is a little too bad for me,the plot is pretty simple and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,just to get you to think that the actors were n't going to die,just to show the real story of the young and beautiful and talented young woman
1,the movie starts with an old man,the plot is n't that bad
1,the plot and characters are just so weak and the ending is just,the story has its own merits and the acting is very good
1,i do n't think that anyone could ever be subjected to the same thing but the fact that,i am not the biggest fan of the book but i was a fan of his work
1,he 's not a typical villain and the two are all the better for this one,he was also the real hero in this one and he did n't even have to do
1,as with many more films i have seen a lot of them but i,as the film goes on it 's a pretty sight of the two
1,she 's so much of a jerk and so much of the acting is,she is the only one who has any real interest in his role
1,but this one is n't even close to the,but this is a movie you should see
1,i think that this film was a great deal of fun in my opinion,i 've been a fan of the original for over 30 years and i think
1,it was like a bad dream movie,it 's not as good as it gets
1,camerawork is ok but it is n't that bad,camerawork wise this is a film which is a bit
1,disney 's the first batman film the awakening that eats the hearts and lows of the genre is,disney is the one and only liberals who will not like the show as well as others
1,we get a glimpse at what a man is and how he could do it,we have the exact same feeling that the director is so confused that i can see
1,he 's got the best line and the most hilarious of all,he 's an old man who has been living in a town for
1,there 's a lot of action in the movie and it 's very,there is a good amount of suspense and some really good moments
1,i do n't think that this was the only good acting in the,i have seen it countless times and it was a great success
1,do n't get me wrong i liked the film and was very excited when i found out that,do n't worry to the movie it 's the worst movie it has ever had ever produced
1,the movie is not as simple as the one,the story itself has a lot of potential
1,tarantino has the ability to make us believe he 's responsible for his actions but they have the right to be his,tarantino has done a good job of making the story a great one and is still an excellent piece of work
1,i am glad i did but i was not impressed with the movie and did,i would love to see a film that deals with the subject of war
1,i would n't even say that the story line is very poor,i 've watched the original series and i have seen it all
1,good luck on the way they are portrayed as a couple of friends but they ca n't get into a,good luck for those who have read the books for the movie and have not seen them in years
1,one of the most interesting and intriguing scenes is when the young lady 's mother is kidnapped and raped by a man with the same hand,one of those movies that you will see is not only a great movie but a pleasant film and it certainly deserves to be seen
1,much of the film involves a man who 's a child and a little,much of the film involves the main character played by robert de niro
1,i have to admit that i had n't seen this movie since,i was surprised at how much the acting sucked from there
1,like most of us i can only say that the film is,like all movies i 've seen in my life the best
1,she is the perfect person to play the role of a man who has a love of her life,she 's not the best actress but she is a very good actress and is n't given a chance to
1,what is the matter in the plot,what is the deal with the other characters
1,aside from a few faults the film is a mess,aside from the fact that the story is so weak it
1,many have commented on this show but that 's just a little bit of the way,many people have said that this is a great story and a very funny one
1,well i do n't have a problem with this,well you ca n't help but wonder if there is
1,all of the characters are very interesting and the actors are all,all the women in this movie are either ugly or stupid
1,i saw the movie in the theater on tcm and thought it was great but this was just one thing that could not possibly,i 've seen this movie twice on tv and it 's still one of the great things i 've seen in the cinema
1,whatever the reason why the film is not so much more than it is,whatever it was a good movie i was not sure what to expect
1,imagine what the director was trying to do but he was n't,imagine if you have an iq of a story about it and you
1,realizing i have no idea about the characters or characters that the writers did for me this could,realizing that the only way it 's ever made are you are not going to be disappointed
1,watch the film and you will see how much of a great,watch it if you have the choice of a good director
1,most of the film is about the people that are trying to figure out who killed the killer and the,most of the film 's dialogue and dialogue was dubbed out of nowhere and they were both poorly written
1,it is one of those movies that 's so bad that it 's almost embarrassing,it is a great film to watch and it 's a joy to behold
1,does it take a little bit to get used,does she get a divorce from his father
1,i saw this movie on the big screen,i have to give you one word
1,he has a knack for a man to kill the president of the united states but,he plays the part of two very cool people who are trying at a party
1,james stewart is the only actor that has a very good part as,james cagney was in this movie the same actor as the cop
1,in this film the director of course was the one,in a scene he uses a pair of scissors
1,neither of them ever ever ever did,neither the plot nor the plot is so
1,i saw the movie for the first time and it still is the funniest movie i 've seen,i have seen the first two seasons of this series and it 's not just a series of episodes
1,forgive me for having the best movie ever and this is the only one i can think of that is worse,forgive me for the bad acting and the fact that the movie is n't about the evils of the holocaust
1,continuously it 's not the same,continuously enough i have no clue why
1,his mother and father are not in love or even care about their,his wife was a little more of a recluse than his dad
1,director david cronenberg 's vision of this film was a great idea but it was so poorly executed,director and producer john ford 's film noir film set in the early 1900 's and early 80 's
1,this was the first time i saw it,this is a good movie but it is n't
1,that 's what i got in the first place,that was the worst movie ever made but the movie
1,when i saw a film i was shocked and excited,when i saw the movie i could n't wait for the
1,the plot has been told in a way that it is a complete failure to sit,the story is a bit predictable and i did n't care for the main characters
1,the acting and writing is terrible and the story is a little confusing,the film is an insult to the book but it also shows a lot
1,in my opinion there is an element here that is not only a few people in their life,in the first movie i was really excited to have a copy of this on the shelf
1,this is a very good film and it certainly is worth it,this is one of those movies that will never seem to be the
1,the film is a bit slow and the,the only redeeming quality was the music
1,2 it 's not for everyone but i guess you do,2 the story and the characters are all pretty good
1,as a result the movie is a waste of time,as i mentioned earlier that the director was a bit of
1,another thing is i have to say it was a little too slow and boring but there were enough plot holes to make for a good movie,another thing that i found funny was the scene where he says something about the film as the first film in a row and the last 15 minutes
1,richard chamberlain has a small role as the president,richard widmark was the best of the two
1,i 've heard that he has the ability to,i would like to thank you for trying
1,crossing the border for the big break is a movie of the sort i 've seen in a few minutes and,crossing the border is an interesting story and a very good film that should have been shown in the theater
1,one day a woman comes out of her car,one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
1,and that 's not to say this movie was a flop,and if you are a fan of the series watch this film
1,as for the rest of the cast it 's not that bad,as for the movie it is the story of a young woman in
1,he does n't really know how to get it,he does not have to be a big guy
1,fred gwynne as a tough guy and a great actor,fred olen ray 's first directorial effort was the last straw
1,the movie itself was a lot better,the film opens with a young man trying
1,the script and acting was horrible,the acting and directing are top notch
1,powell and his cohorts are the only one who has the ability to be,powell is a fine actor and is the real star of the film
1,nicely acted and acted this is one of those movies that,nicely done with a very good story and great actors
1,the only thing this could 've made about this movie was the way the,the story is a bit confusing and the characters are just plain dull
1,i have n't been impressed with the movie as a whole,i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of
1,there is a very good scene in the,there are a few moments of hilarity
1,he 's also a very talented man and i do remember how he 's got a,he does not even seem a little interested to be the villain in the movie
1,the script and script is so awful that i actually thought the movie was funny,the movie was shot during a time and it was the first feature film in the
1,wayne and his friend and father of one of them are a young couple,wayne and lombard are great together and the film is well worth seeing
1,it 's just a bad movie,it 's a good film and a
1,as an example of what a film should be about a young woman 's,as i watched the whole movie it was a waste of my time
1,that 's why i have no respect,that was the only way i could have
1,jason is the one who 's the son of an old man and is a woman who is a child in a world of the past,jason biggs is in a film that 's a bit over the top but his work is just as bad as his acting in the film
1,a few things are n't bad at all,a few weeks ago i was expecting something more
1,then he decides to go to the local town to investigate his own life,then the movie started to drag and the film is n't going to be so
1,so i guess it 's just that the movie has a few,so i did n't see any of these characters or anything
1,too bad that i have n't seen it in years,too bad they did n't have the talent to make this
1,it 's not even that bad,it is an interesting movie and a
1,we have a lot to like about the film and its a,we see that the movie is not a typical slasher film
1,this is a very good and entertaining,this is the best film ever
1,i do n't know how i could get a refund to watch this film,i think i could write a script about this film but instead we get that
1,another problem was that he never had to rely on it,another thing that i have never heard of is that this is
1,she is not the same actress that she,she was also very very very funny
1,how the hell did they get out of the building,how did we get the idea that this was a movie
1,bixby 's character is so believable that even the supporting cast,bixby and the rest were all very good as well
1,they are all good in their own way but they are n't,they 're not just the ones you would want to see
1,i have n't read the book but that was a very positive thing,i have seen all the bad movies and this one is one of the
1,i have not seen a movie that i have seen where this film was filmed on dv,i 've been a bit of a fan of the genre for years and i am a big
1,when the movie is over and foremost it becomes obvious why they were n't making the,when they 're on the island they get a chance to kill the bad guys
1,while i am not a fan of movies that are not as good as they are i would have liked this one,while i 've read the comments and i have a soft idea for what they have done it makes me want to be
1,i would recommend this film highly recommended and it would be a waste of time to watch it on tv,i am not a movie snob i am just so ignorant that my mother is so obsessed with it
1,one of my favorites is to see a movie that has been made and i can understand this,one of my favorites is the one that has all the elements of a typical hollywood movie
1,all in all not worth watching,all in all this is a great
1,subsequent scenes were filmed with the same music as the rest of the film which was also the most interesting thing to be seen in the film,subsequent spoiler for the end you 're left wondering how many people are willing to kill people and kill them and then they will be dead
1,the movie itself was n't even as bad as,the film is also a very funny one
1,also the film was filmed by the very beautiful jan andrews who was in fact,also the fact that it has a very long running time is really funny
1,my favorite scene is where she 's wearing an orange and bikini,my wife told me about it and i have to say that i
1,great acting excellent acting and a great story to keep your,great movie from the director and a very strong director
1,one of the most underrated movies ever,one thing that 's good is that it
1,the only thing i liked about this movie is that it is a very good movie,the story of the girl who has a boyfriend who is a little more than a teenager
1,nimoy plays the part of a man whose mother who works for her family is a very good man with a heart of gold,nimoy as the cop is also very good with her and his performance as the lead character is very believable and the supporting role in
1,the story is so bad that i actually thought that i was,the script is a lot less interesting than a real story
1,only a few weeks ago this is a very enjoyable show and it 's a real treat to,only a few years later he has a girlfriend on the train with a shotgun on him
1,actors are n't really a bunch of actors who do,actors do an excellent job and the supporting cast
1,no other actor is a caricature of a good person but the film itself,no one can ever say that i do n't care about the characters
1,in the end there was a great deal of action and suspense but nothing really special,in this movie they 're in the movie that they are the most important to the movies
1,i have n't seen a movie that has been made in my entire life,i 've seen the movie twice on tv and i am still wondering what the
1,sure i was looking for a bit of a film and a little bit of a good job but i could n't,sure the film has a few moments which may be a little slow but the story is too thin and predictable
1,i do n't know who wrote the script for the film but i do,i was very impressed by the way i was drawn to this film
1,our 'hero' of the film is a man who can do anything to protect his family,our hero is an old man who is not only his wife but also is a man
1,this film is not a good example,this is a film that has a lot
1,the only good thing about this movie,the acting was horrible as well
1,reap a few minutes of footage from a movie like a few seconds later the film goes on and on and on and on with nothing,reap a venezia from his own mother the daughter is also a very wealthy man in a way he believes is a little too much for him
1,a very enjoyable and very enjoyable film,a lot of the film has been done
1,it is a film about a boy,it 's not a good film
1,but there are a few scenes that make you,but the story has a very simple plot
1,i 've heard that this was a great film for the family and,i am still in a mood to be entertained by the film
1,james cagney is a very talented singer,james stewart is also good and the movie
1,not a good movie for those who do not have to watch it,not to mention the fact that this was n't a movie in the first
1,the first is the one of the best movies of the 90 's,the movie starts out with a very young boy and his son who is
1,the first time i saw this movie i was in a small town at my school,the first time i saw this was i was in the theater at a local drivein and
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been,it has all the elements of a good western
1,all this is the movie is an excellent film,all in all a great film that deserves a wider
1,it is n't even a movie,it 's not a bad movie
1,plus the fact that the main character was a little bit of an idiot was so bad it,plus i have seen that many movies in which they have made it into the movie industry
1,i do n't want to spoil the ending,i was n't really impressed by this movie but
1,i was very disappointed to see this movie,i was so disgusted by this movie but i
1,if you 're going to see it then do something else,if you 're looking for a movie that 's worth watching for
1,first of all the film is a total mess of the first,first of all there 's some nice music and dance numbers
1,and i do n't want to go away but it 's so bad it 's good,and the scene at the end when the woman is lying and the camera shakes up is
1,his wife is the son of a wealthy man who is,his character is a likable actor who has no personality
1,hong kong action films with some of the most memorable action sequences ever put to film,hong kong films of the 1950s and 40s are all in a very good sense of humor
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was not only bad in
1,i 've been looking for a film that has a great cast but,i would recommend this to any fan of any of the others
1,when it 's finally shown on a cable tv station and the next morning i was watching it i thought oh yeah it was great,when she 's on screen you 're left wondering why she 's still alive and when she 's supposed to be the one who 's got
1,the film is a total mess,the acting is very good the acting
1,unlike any of us we were never allowed to believe,unlike the original the series is a great deal of fun
1,goes ahead to the old folks of all the movies that,goes to the video store and rent it on tv
1,the film is set during the early,the plot is a bit confusing
1,not to mention this movie was a big disappointment to me,not only did he do a good job and i think that
1,there was no real reason for it to be released,there is also some nice cinematography and the movie is very
1,all i can say is that this,all in all a great movie
1,same for the rest of the movie but not enough,same thing to say that this is just a film that
1,no doubt the only thing good to me was the movie 's,no one can replace that with any of his other work
1,but the movie is not a movie that is n't a good one,but the story is a little too complicated to be good enough
1,that would have been much more interesting,that 's a shame because i am not
1,i think i was the only reason the show was going to be released in dvd,i 've never seen a movie that could have been more entertaining and interesting and had it
1,for those of you unfamiliar with you may have a problem with it 's a bit confusing,for a movie that 's a little slow at times it makes me wonder why there were so
1,when i saw it on the shelf it was the first movie i have ever seen before and i have seen some of the original movies of the same name,when the film is over and the director makes you feel the pain you 're watching it the acting is pretty decent but that is n't saying much for me
1,rain was not a good movie to begin with,rain 's father is a very powerful and very funny
1,if you 've seen the trailer i 'd say that i would have given the movie a 10,if you 're looking for a funny film to watch and watch again then you 'll love it
1,with the exception of the movie 's title song the film was a total flop,with all the hype on the subject of this film the director and his wife were
1,like the previous reviewer said it 's a great movie to watch,like i said the film is very entertaining and i think the actors
1,i am a sucker for the fact that a man who loves a good horror movie can actually appreciate the fact that,i was a little surprised at the onset and the way the movie is shot at the beginning of the movie
1,but there 's no denying that the film,but this is a really bad movie
1,they all know it is a big joke,they are the real people of this planet
1,could i not get a grip on the film,could have done without it the least bit
1,the movie is about a group of people that are attacked by one,the story is n't bad enough but the characters are n't likable
1,true this was n't the movie that got my goat but i thought the story was,true the movie has a bit of an interesting concept but it is so boring
1,i do n't remember much about the characters in the story but this,i do n't think anyone has ever seen it in a theater
1,someones mother 's son and mother are the son and they are in the same house,someones friend has an alibi with an old flame named the head of the family
1,i would have liked the movie to have had been so much more,i saw it when it aired in theatres and it scared me
1,in this movie we are shown to be a little harsh and a lot of the movie is just a dream to the audience to understand what 's going on but i was not thrilled to,in the beginning of the movie the characters were introduced to the audience as though they had the same idea and it is obvious that there was more to this story than it would be
1,if you have a craving for a bad movie you should definitely check out the first 10 minutes of the movie,if i had n't been a fan of the first three movies i might have had a bit more attention to the
1,it was so bad that it made no sense,it is not the most original or the most interesting
1,however the film is just a little too,however the film is just plain awful
1,or maybe i was in my late teens,or perhaps it 's all a little too old
1,and if that 's not what we are supposed to,and the story is a bit thin and predictable
1,i am a fan of the book and i have always loved,i do n't know who it is that they are talking
1,in a movie of that type you get the,in the end i was a bit confused
1,it 's a shame that the director and the producers decided that this was an awful waste of film,it 's a shame that this film is n't available on dvd in english and released in dvd
1,instead it 's not even close to the truth,instead it was made into a feature length movie
1,i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller,i have n't seen this film but i 've seen it many
1,i would have given the movie zero if i had been there so,i 've seen better acting in porn movies and movies like this
1,napoleon dynamite the best known actress in hollywood,napoleon duck has a very funny cameo
1,while the film does have its moments and is n't particularly interesting it 's a very moving story,while i do n't think that 's fair enough to be entertaining i would have to say that the
1,so many of these things have to do with the movie,so why does this movie have a lot of action
1,yen and the others are good enough,yen to wed is a good film for
1,the acting is horrible and the story is so boring it becomes a joke to sit through,the story is about a young woman searching for her missing sister 's mother who lives in a
1,but it is n't as much as an early film,but the film 's story is just too much too late
1,and it does n't even have the decency to be funny to me,and the acting is so horrible that you 'll be amazed at the ineptitude
1,but if you do n't want to be a fan of the genre you should see this movie,but it 's also a little bit of a stretch for the audience to get involved with the characters
1,a few people have said that this film is not a masterpiece,a few scenes of this film are quite amusing and i liked it
1,the film opens with the man being murdered by a woman,the film also has the feel of a good movie
1,the film has a very good story,the film does n't make a lick of
1,bell is one of my favorite actors,bell was a great character in a film
1,now i'm just thinking of being as bad as this,now i'm not sure what to say about this movie except
1,intermittently the movie is a little slow to start,intermittently the film is not a total disaster
1,the film has a lot of action and a bit of romance and a couple of good scenes that i,the acting was pretty bad with the lead actress who could have done a better job with her character
1,you do n't have to be a fan to appreciate the film but you 'll be able to appreciate the film 's faults as well,you will find yourself wishing it was n't that good at least not as bad as the first one but the movie was n't
1,they are all the same characters in the movie that they do,they did n't have a movie in the past that they could have
1,and it 's not even the same as i do,and i think that 's how they are all that 's
1,this is one of my top five favorite films of all,this is a very good film for a rainy afternoon
1,they should be proud for the fact that the movie,they should have made it a bit more entertaining
1,there are some great sequences and a few moments that are so funny that you 'll laugh once,there should have been a sequel for the sequel and the result is a pretty faithful entry
1,when i watched this i could have done it for the rest of my,when a group of people get together they are sent into a car
1,besides the film 's premise the film was a total waste of time,besides the acting the story line is very weak and the characters seem forced
1,to be honest i had no idea what,to me it is an excellent film
1,some of us will recognize the fact that the movie,some of the jokes are not funny or witty
1,i do n't think anyone can relate to that in,i was surprised at how good this movie is
1,it 's a shame because it is so bad that it 's funny,it is a very good story with an intriguing storyline and a great cast
1,the first time i saw the movie in this movie was the fact that i was n't,the only good things about this movie were the performances of the characters and the actors
1,sadly it is the fact that this film is n't even remotely scary and has been made to be shown,sadly the film is a bit over the top and it is not as bad as it should be
1,but the story is not so bad it,but then again what do we know
1,without question the movie does n't seem to have the potential to have a decent script,without any hesitation to speak of this it has to be the worst of the year
1,i have to say that the acting in this movie,i think i have seen a lot of movies
1,the movie was so bad i wanted to vomit,the only way i could nitpick with this movie is
1,besides the acting is n't bad enough to,besides that the movie is very good
1,cloris leachman as the love interest is the most beautiful character,cloris leachman 's performance in this film is the best thing i
1,paul giamatti as a former police officer is a bit too tough to be taken seriously in this role,paul newman and william powell are a fine team and the supporting cast has a nice cameo as the lead
1,you know that you have a lot of fun to watch,you have a movie you 've seen so many times so often
1,riding lessons to the end the story was so stupid that the whole film is n't just about the way things are about the plot,riding lessons and other factors is that we can only hear about what happened to the main characters and it 's just that they 're not
1,fortunately he did n't have to pay a loan and a few days back in the,fortunately the movie 's success comes from the fact that this is not a film
1,this movie does not seem to have the right idea to be,this film should never have made it to video box office
1,loy does a great job as the young christy brown,loy is a fine actor but she plays a very strong
1,they 're the ones who have never heard of the first film and it 's a,they should have done a sequel instead and let this show have to be canceled
1,this is a movie you can watch over and,this is one of my favorite horror films
1,keep this one from the shelf,keep the film on the shelf
1,it has all sorts of clichs,it 's an insult to the intelligence
1,that 's a little too much for me,that 's why they should have made this film
1,however there was an opportunity to be made to be a,however the movie was not a complete waste of time
1,and i do n't know the reason why the people who put it in the movie should be,and i do n't think the director 's intended for the movie is a bit more realistic
1,the story line was very good and so was the acting and the script was n't bad,the acting is horrible and there is a few other minor scenes which have nothing to do with
1,think of it as an old fashioned show,think of it as a movie it was a
1,as for the story i thought this movie was pretty good,as an avid moviegoer who was in the army at the time
1,if they are n't a little smarter you can find a better film better,if you want to see a film that you can see that you 're going
1,i do not remember the name that was written to be an actor,i was surprised by the fact that the film had so many twists and
1,overall this is a very funny cartoon with,overall it just is n't worth watching
1,if you want to see a really bad movie this is a must see,if you can find a copy of this movie you will find it hard to
1,the acting is superb especially from robert young,the script for the movie is not even that
1,this is one of the very worst movies ever made,this movie is about a bunch of people who live their
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen better acting,this film is a great film that is so rare to see the first time and
1,for a while i was able to sit through a movie with a bunch of friends in it,for a moment the director of photography is not as good at the film as the other movies that
1,the acting was terrible all around the movie was terrible,the film is a very long and boring film
1,the story is so simple and the ending and so it,the film is very slow and the acting is terrible
1,has the film been a good idea,has it not been a hundred
1,i 've been waiting for a movie to come out and i was so excited to watch it,i think the film would have been better if the director had had a bigger name for his work
1,this movie is a total bore,this film is a must see
1,it was n't funny it was bad it was n't very good,it 's a pity it never made it to video stores
1,he was the only one that was able to make the movie,he is the first and only person who has to deal with the
1,instead we are treated to a bland mishmash of scenes that are,instead i found myself asking myself why i had to choose
1,the only thing that made this movie worth seeing was the acting of michael madsen,the movie is not about the war but it is a very good movie with a
1,the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because the story,the first half of this movie was a complete waste of time
1,those who have read the book will read about this movie in terms of the plot and characters of the original,those of us who know nothing more of the film 's style should be ashamed of themselves in the world of the
1,the only redeeming feature of the movie is the presence of a very good,the plot and story line were pretty good and the acting was good
1,my advice is to watch it for the next quid,my advice is to stay away and see the movie
1,so i do not want to spoil,so i can forgive this one
1,they did n't even get the money to use it to play the roles in this film,they are not the same actors that do in the original movie but the movie has no story
1,much to the disgust of the audience 's,much to the point of the story
1,i think that 's the problem of the film,i would like to see this movie again
1,and the ending with his dad 's death in the beginning is,and it is not that the movie does n't make sense
1,the movie is not a comedy but it 's not very funny,the script is a little slow but the characters are well developed
1,make a mistake of making a movie,make the film a little more fun to
1,the film has a few funny moments but is n't really funny,the only thing i liked was that the characters were n't fleshed at
1,rob reiner 's direction and cinematography are superb and he does a very good job as a,rob roy had a very funny cameo but it 's not as bad as i expected
1,did they just need to get it out,did it have any other movie stars
1,and that 's about all it is,and if you 're looking for a great
1,as a result it 's not very good,as a child i think it was a great
1,i have a problem with a few films and the ones with the exception of the movie is not so good as the first,i am not saying this is a good movie but it is a very entertaining and enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages as
1,my favourite scene is the one where the woman goes to sleep,my only question is that the film is set in new zealand and
1,its so obvious that the whole thing is a total mess,its the same kind of film as the original it 's not
1,no it was n't so much,no matter how far they could you
1,as for the acting i would recommend watching this movie,as the film goes on it does n't matter that the
1,all in all it is a pretty good film but it was n't enough,all the characters do is evolve to a level where each character is the same
1,i was expecting something that i would have been a fan of but it did n't work,i do agree with some of them that this is n't bad but it 's not
1,this is a must see for all film fans,this movie is just another bad movie in the style
1,fulci 's direction is very good as the camera moves around with a,fulci 's character has a motive for the death of a child
1,it would be easy to see this film on tv in the near future and if you 're looking for a film with some mates you 'll be,it is a shame that the film is so much more than a waste of time and money but not for anyone with a modicum of talent
1,fantastic movie about the power of mankind that,fantastic music score by george c mcginley
1,if it 's the best it is n't so far from the book it 's a lot better,if you can find a better way to spend 90 minutes or less then just watch this movie and
1,the film 's plot is a little thin,the film opens with a young woman named anna
1,the film is a complete mess of the first movie,the acting is horrible and the script is bad
1,remember how many times the camera was shot out and i was wondering what was happening in the scene at the end of the,remember that it was a good movie for those who like to be entertained at the art of the film making the film
1,still the movie is a little too slow and,still there is no reason to watch it
1,definitely the worst movie i have ever seen,definitely the most interesting character in the movie was
1,i was expecting something like this to be a waste of time,i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good romance with
1,during the time he spent on his life he had a chance to go ahead and retrieve him,during that scene they 're the same two guys that are being chased by the car and then they
1,once you see the movie you 'll get an idea of what the movie is about,once you 're watching it i feel that the film will never be the same again as
1,most people have seen this movie on the imdb site and the user comments on imdb seem,most of the time the movie was a bit slow but the characters were very good
1,sex in a way that 's a bit too far fetched,sex and violence is the kind of movie that you can watch
1,kudos to the director who had directed some pretty good,kudos to the director for creating a good film
1,while i 've always loved the story i was not surprised by the fact that it was filmed in the early 90 's,while i have a few problems with that it 's a bit hard to believe that the director could write a better script than
1,however the film is not so bad it 's just bad,however as a result this is still one of the better films
1,by the end we get a movie where a couple of the characters are killed at one point and another in which he is supposed to be a character,by the time the credits roll you are not sure if you are a fan of the movie or what it really takes to make a horror film
1,i 've seen it twice and i can only conclude that it 's the best i 've ever,i do n't know what to expect from such a bad film but this is just one
1,in the meantime of a film he is able to do anything,in fact i do n't understand why the director should n't be making
1,hilary kikuchi was a great actress but she did not do a good job,hilary swank is good as the mother who does the same thing as the one
1,ram gopal varma 's direction is superb and the script is very sharp,ram gopal varma 's direction for this film is pretty good and the cinematography
1,the acting was so bad i was embarrassed to see that it was a complete failure,the first is the story of a young man who is a loner in the hospital with
1,if you can make a movie with an actor who is n't good enough with,if you are looking for something more entertaining and fun then watch this movie
1,watch for the performances of all the actors,watch it if you 're in a mood to
1,visual effects have a great plot line and the performances are good,visual style is also very effective but it is very well executed
1,maybe they should just say it 's not a bad,maybe that 's what makes it a bad movie
1,she 's a good actress as her character is so likable that you ca n't,she 's a woman who has been married to the daughter of an aunt
1,he is not so much as one of his colleagues who have been in love but still in the,he also has to go to the bar and see a girl that she has done so well
1,fatty is a very nice movie,fatty 's character is a caricature and
1,james stewart was the best in the movie and he had a great supporting role,james caan is a good actor who can play an actor who is a good actor
1,i do n't know why people would not have the same thing but the people in it are not bad,i think it is a very enjoyable film that should also make you wonder what 's the purpose of making this
1,but there are a few good things in this movie,but if you want to see an excellent movie with an
1,i saw the movie yesterday and it was great,i do n't care if it 's the fault of
1,then it turns out that a man and his dog is abducted by some mysterious beast in the,then i realized the whole movie was shot on a low budget and was n't very convincing
1,the only redeeming factor to this film is the,the film is a bit of a letdown
1,and what 's that all about in the end,and if you are a fan of the show then
1,my favorite part when i watched the first episode was a bunch of friends walking around the house,my favorite part of the film is the one where the mother of the boy and her mother are
1,this is not one of them,this film is one of the best
1,if you do like that i do n't think it is,if you 've seen them you 'll know how the show was
1,the first half of the film consists of a few scenes of events that seem to drag on and on and on,the story is simple and the actors who have been in great performances are not good at least they are good
1,that said i was n't impressed by the whole thing,that 's a big problem since the director has done a
1,now if you 're looking for a scary movie i can guarantee you will have a good time watching it,now i have read some other reviews posted here and the fact that the story is a bit more realistic and
1,these two films offer that it is not the best movie ever made,these are the things he 's trying to get from this project
1,any of the other reviewers of this film have said,any movie that is a complete waste of time
1,hard boiled has a good deal of the plot and the characters are likable,hard hitting is another of those movies that you can watch over and over and
1,a lot of the acting in this film is terrible as well,a lot of these people were not even in the movie but this
1,so if you have a chance to see it do yourself a favor and watch it,so many people have been in this movie for no apparent reason and i am sure it
1,and i think the film has the potential to have a nice time in the,and there 's the scene when we see the first half of the movie
1,kudos to the director for putting his,kudos to director michael j fox
1,those who love a great story that are well done are not too easy for,those who are into the story are not a priority to watch this movie
1,despite all the problems the film has its moments with the plot of the movie the acting is terrible as it goes along,despite its weaknesses i was n't sure whether to be engaged to this film or the film i had hoped the film would be
1,as far as i know it 's a pretty good film and i hope it,as with the earlier movies this one does n't have to be the worst
1,i was hoping the movie was a bit better,i have been looking for my dvd copy
1,yep i have seen this on a shelf,yep that would be a great idea
1,the film was also filmed in color and it 's almost like that in the first scene with the camera lens and the lighting,the film 's premise is to be honest and the story itself is n't that good and i do agree that it is not
1,the movie is a complete disaster,the acting is terrible the plot is
1,neither of the two movies ever made a movie that they could,neither do i really care much for anything about this movie
1,spoiler ahead i 've heard a few comments about this movie and i do not recommend this,spoiler alert spoilers the first one was a complete surprise and i was expecting the worst
1,the only good thing about this film is the music,the script is a bit weak the story and the dialogue
1,i have never seen a film where i felt this,i was n't expecting too much from this film
1,no one is going to be there,no doubt it is an attempt to capitalize
1,brooke 's role is so bad that,brooke is a beautiful young woman
1,when a movie is made of a bunch of people who have been in the business,when the first half of the picture arrives the movie slows down to a conclusion
1,a few years ago i had to watch this,a few years later he was in a coma
1,this is the first time i have seen it and that 's how i,this movie is one that i think i would enjoy watching this movie
1,lack of coherence to the film and the characters that are supposed,lack of funds or anything else is done with this movie
1,i would love to see this movie remade in the near,i do n't think this movie is a total bore
1,how do we get the message on our own mind to be so,how the hell can anyone have such a bad name like this
1,which means that a film of the kind is not only a comedy,which means that he is not only the best of the bunch
1,the movie is about a family that is in their own right to be killed by the evil killer and they try to,the movie also features some very interesting themes such as the relationship between the two brothers and the girl and the son
1,schlesinger is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by all audiences,schlesinger 's character is so much more than it is the story is so
1,for example i was in love with the movie 's end and i do n't think that the characters have a purpose to the story,for the first time in time i found myself wondering if this was a bad attempt or a really good movie but it did n't
1,bert is an intelligent young woman who is a very good actor,bert jacobi as an actor who is n't as good as a character
1,i think that this was a good movie for a good film,i would have liked to have seen more of her in the role
1,helen mirren is a very strong actor but this film lacks the depth to make this film,helen hayes as the mother of the mother is so beautiful and so convincing to watch so many
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this movie is just bad not good for people who
1,it 's a movie that is so bad that you ca n't make it through,it is the most beautiful film of the year and a very beautiful story of a
1,as the first half of the movie i thought it was a very good movie,as for the acting of daniel daylewis as a very imposing villain he 's a little
1,her mother and mother were also quite attractive and their parents were so well acted,her mother is a beautiful woman who is a woman who 's been married in a
1,a few scenes of the film include the two,a very enjoyable scene and a great ending
1,in short there is also a bit of violence and gore but not in this,in the end it becomes a little bit too abrupt to be taken seriously
1,we are told about the story and we are all told that the film,we know that the movie 's title is the same as the first
1,sir john gielgud and john payne give the best performances in,sir rukh has done some excellent job in this film
1,it 's like a tv series with a little kid running on,it is a shame that the film does n't get a wider audience
1,the first half was a little too slow,the script is also full of twists and turns
1,holden and dunne are the only ones who can be blamed for this film,holden is a good actor but his performance is the worst in the entire movie
1,the film was shot at the very least,the film is about the same as a group
1,of course i was n't too impressed by this movie,of course this film is the first to be remade as
1,i do n't know why it was so bad but it 's a,i think that the director 's commentary is not only for him
1,a great film that will make you,a very enjoyable movie to watch
1,seriously if you 're looking for a fun movie about two girls try to solve their crimes and,seriously i think that i was a little disappointed with the acting because i was n't disappointed
1,so much for the film and for the characters the film is,so much better than the one that 's the first one
1,this is a movie about a group of,this movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,vh1 's film version of 'the twilight zone' has its own unique elements of,vh1 and her fans will always remember that it is a great show
1,akshay kumar is the most underrated actor of all time,akshay kumar and the rest of the supporting cast are excellent
1,the movie is about the same kind of character who is trying too hard to be funny but is not funny at,the only reason this movie was so great was the fact that it was a complete ripoff of the first film
1,it is a good movie to see if you can find it,it does have its moments but i did like that the ending was
1,even a little bit of a problem is the lack,even the actors in this film are very bad
1,this was a great show for kids,this is a pretty lame film
1,the first one has a good story line and some great acting,the movie has a great supporting cast and a very good supporting cast
1,it 's the story of a man who is in prison for a long time,it 's the same kind of role and that 's all i can say
1,2006 's a movie with no budget and the result is a film about,2006 a space station is located on earth in the middle of nowhere
1,something like the real life and this was all there was to it,something to do with this movie but you ca n't go wrong
1,he was so funny he made a lot of bad movies,he 's a bit of a loser who has the same sense
1,so what 's worse vernon has been a huge problem,so much for the fact that the characters are not developed
1,there are so many other great actors out there,there is a lot to say about this movie but
1,some of the scenes were so bad they actually had a good laugh,some of the actors are so bad and it 's laughable that they are
1,terrible script terrible acting terrible dialogue and bad music,terrible acting and a ridiculous script that just did n't
1,if you have not seen it i highly recommend it,if you want to watch a movie with lots of sex
1,but that 's a good thing,but the fact that the characters are
1,okay that 's not all bad but it is a great movie for those who do n't like the original,okay i know that 's what this film would have had been if it had been more entertaining if it were
1,after seeing this film i was a little sceptical of the first two thirds of the plot but this one was n't so great,after seeing the movie for free i decided to go out and buy a dvd copy of a dvd and a vhs copy for a
1,i'm still a fan of the original but the first half of the film has a very bad ending,i'm surprised that this movie was released theatrically in the us but i do have to agree one of the
1,but the movie is so awful that i ca n't even believe it was made,but then again i do agree with the comment that this is a great piece of
1,the film was a total disaster,the film is very much the most
1,both movies are a little better than the ones that are in the works of the,both of these films are so bad it 's good but that they 're not
1,first it 's a film that is n't so bad it is good to watch,first of all i do n't mind that i do n't get the point it is
1,he 's got to be one of,he 's in love with her
1,she is a little more convincing than a young woman,she has a few scenes that i did n't really understand
1,in one scene she 's wearing a bra,in the end the film is really bad
1,being one of my favorite movies of all time i was a little confused when they came in this movie,being a huge fan of the first two thirds of the series i was hoping that something would be better
1,the plot is pretty basic and not even the action,the movie is n't really a good movie either
1,this movie could have been so bad,this was a really awful film
1,is the story so stupid and unbelievable,is it possible to be the one to
1,this film is a waste of money and time,this film was a big disappointment to watch
1,like most movies i have seen this is the one that has the best actors,like the other comments said about his films this is one that you will enjoy
1,guys who are not afraid to make a documentary about the real world is not a,guys who are so bad that you have to sit around and watch the movie
1,the movie was just plain stupid,the script is pretty good and the
1,chaplin 's film is a very good documentary that should,chaplin is the best and the actors are great
1,the film is also a very moving and moving portrait of the lives of a bunch of people who go,the plot is a joke from beginning to end and the ending is just as stupid as i did
1,the movie has a good story and it moves along well,the movie was not a very good one but the acting was
1,and what is most memorable is that she has a,and what was this film supposed to be about
1,also a lot of the characters were killed in a gruesome,also it 's not funny it 's not even funny
1,this movie is the perfect example of a movie noir movie that should have been called,this movie has a certain amount of potential that makes it even cooler for me
1,abiding love story is a film about a group of four women in love,abiding in the first place we are left with a feeling of a sense of
1,if you are looking for a great movie to be entertained by a great story you should go and see,if i were to make a choice with the film i would have been more interested in a movie
1,in fact the only good thing is the soundtrack,in fact it was just a bit too bad to
1,the film opens with a couple of nice shots but not as good,the story is not about a group of people who are living in a
1,which is a shame because it 's a,which is why i was so impressed
1,read the book and do so,read the book and you have two
1,particularly when you 're watching the movie,particularly when you consider the truth with the
1,i have to say this film is one of the worst i have ever seen,i have to say i was really surprised at what the film 's budget looked like
1,the film is not only about a group of teens and their own lives as a child,the plot is n't a bit original the acting is pretty bad and the acting is n't bad
1,the only thing to do was to make it into one of the first movies that it has ever made for,the acting is horrible from beginning to end the whole movie is a mess of any kind of movie or a comedy
1,this movie was so bad i had,this is a very good film
1,i would recommend this to anyone,i have seen some other movies with
1,the film is a very interesting one,the film has a certain charm
1,i was expecting something like this to be a great movie,i was very surprised at how stupid this film is
1,this is the kind of film that is a waste of time money and money,this film is one of the best ever to be made to have been a success
1,the story of the mother 's quest to find her father is a bit more interesting,the story was very well done and was not a complete waste of the talents
1,i do n't think the producers of this show thought it was,i think that is the most important element in the movie
1,well i think the movie is so good and it,well i think that this is a must see
1,he plays a character who has a crush on the world,he 's a little bit too much and too many
1,this is n't the worst film ever,this is a very good show
1,of course he 's the kind of hero who wants,of course the only problem is the story itself
1,he had no idea that his wife would ever be in this film,he was the first to die and he is also a very nice guy
1,she was the first of the two and i think that 's why i love her,she was n't so much a part of a story and was the only reason i watched
1,penn plays a very likable man in a movie about a boy and his daughter as well as the other,penn was so much better in the first film that i thought he is the best actor in the movie
1,the story was pretty good and the story line was interesting,the plot is so simple and ridiculous that it does n't make
1,let me tell you that i am a fan of this,let me say that this movie was a huge mistake
1,here we are shown the film 's story the characters,here is a film that will not be remembered
1,cassie and her brother have no qualms of how they are to live,cassie 's character is just so stupid that you can feel sorry for her
1,also the film is full of tension and mystery in the end,also i do n't think it was meant to be the same way
1,you will be glad that i did,you do n't even get to see a
1,wow it 's the most boring,wow it is n't a good movie
1,it 's not just a movie it 's an insult to the viewer,it 's a shame that the director never managed to capture a very good
1,i am a fan of the first one and i,i have no idea why this show was canceled
1,but it is a very bad movie to watch,but the film is so full of clichs that they
1,it 's a pretty bad movie with some good performances and the story is really good,it 's not that the movie is funny and is the only one who is really funny
1,it is a film with a lot of potential but,it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i do n't know how to explain the fact that they were,i am glad i did n't pay attention to my friends
1,why would the people who participated in the,why does she have to do this
1,except that the film was shot entirely on a stage camera that looked like it was filmed on,except that there was a little more to work at it could be a very good film
1,the only good thing in it is that the story has the,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the cast
1,seriously i think that was a great idea,seriously i would give this movie a zero but
1,the first half was pretty boring,the film is very well directed by
1,emma is the best of the bunch and i 've seen the,emma roberts is a good actress who is always very good
1,a good premise and one of the best in the movie to be made,a lot of the scenes seem to have been edited in the editing room for
1,it does n't take long for a lot of the movie to be edited and the characters are very annoying,it 's like he has been drugged off by a car and is blown out of nowhere in a room and
1,i would like to have seen more of the series but it is just a bit too long,i would like to give credit where credit must go to the director 's direction which is why his
1,the movie is a complete mess,the only thing that was n't bad
1,excellent performances by everyone involved in this movie and i would n't say it was,excellent performances and a story that has all the elements of a good movie
1,an insult for me to watch for the rest of my life,an excellent performance by robert duvall as a ruthless and vindictive father whose
1,in a nutshell i have no clue what to make with the film,in a movie like this i do n't care how many times the characters
1,the story and the performances are all solid,the first half has been a long and forgotten
1,for a movie like this you should never get to know the characters,for instance there 's no doubt a movie that should be seen as if
1,i think this movie was a waste of time,i think the main reason why the film is so
1,this is one of the best shows on television i 've seen,this movie had the same feel that it was made with
1,there are two things that have been missing,there is a reason why it would have made
1,not even the great minnie driver,not only that it is very hard
1,i was n't expecting it to end,i was really disappointed with the plot of
1,not so much about it in fact the film is a complete bore that is n't,not only the film itself is a bit too much of a problem with it
1,they are n't all the other characters but the film is a great piece,they are so cute and they 're so good they are just good
1,when the movie finally starts to take place in a few years it 's all very interesting and very well done,when he is asked by the police officer and he says he 's the one to be sent to the next room
1,was this really the only movie ever created by the director and editor of,was that just a matter of what the film was trying to do
1,while the plot line is n't a good one the film is a complete mess,while i do n't think that 's the point i think the film is a bit
1,too bad the only reason i did n't have to give it a 10,too bad he did n't get to the point of making his character
1,j carrol naish has always been in the,j powell is excellent as the villain
1,each scene is an excellent one,each character has a unique personality and
1,mostly due to the presence of the director he is not,mostly this was one of the worst of the lot
1,most importantly this movie has an interesting story line and the story is pretty much a carbon copy and,most of the scenes are very long and they seem to be just as filler to the plot
1,watch this film if you want to,watch it with the lights on
1,there is a lot of the film that is so bad its hard to watch and even though the,there 's nothing inherently wrong with the fact that it is not a comedy or a horror film
1,or maybe that 's why i hate movies that i 've seen,or maybe that 's why it is the worst movie ever made
1,she was n't so much a singer as she 's in this,she 's just not a good actress and she 's a bit of
1,ps i 've never heard of the original movie or even read the book,ps a very good film that has been done by some of the other students
1,thus it was n't so bad i would like to see a good movie with the same title,thus there is a very bad scene involving the killer that the killer is trying to find his mother
1,a film that i did n't know would,a great show for the whole family
1,lucky to find this show in the library on,lucky enough to have a copy of this
1,these characters are all the same,these two characters are not the best
1,the movie is not a complete mess,the movie is a bit boring
1,will smith and the rest of his career come across as an old,will you have to be a kid to enjoy watching this movie
1,you can tell the truth is n't that great,you know what to expect from the film because it
1,i was n't even born in my youth,i saw this film at a theater and it
1,during this time there was a scene in which a young woman has an accident with a woman,during the course of his career in the early 90 's he was an excellent actor but it did
1,sustaining a lot of great action sequences in the film and it does n't matter,sustaining an excellent soundtrack that is not as much as it does in this movie and
1,it was a great movie in which,it is very funny and funny
1,i have seen the movie and i can honestly say it,i do n't care about the characters in this case
1,under the guise of a very good director who does n't have to go overboard with the,under all these things and that 's a bit of a shame to say the least
1,i do n't know how i missed it but it had a very good plot and good performances especially considering the,i have n't seen the series yet and never will but as a whole the film has some great moments
1,it was a little confusing and i found it hard to relate to any,it 's just that you ca n't see the end of it all
1,that 's the whole point of the film,that 's what the film does to those who
1,summing it up in your local video store it is available on video rental,summing up on it and let the movie down is a waste of time
1,kate winslet plays the main character in the film,kate capshaw is great as a woman who has a
1,it 's the only thing that made me laugh out loud,it 's a great movie and it is very good
1,not a bad movie but that 's all,not so much as a film that i would
1,ramsey 's performance is a perfect fit and is a joy to watch,ramsey 's performance is a little overdone and it 's hard to believe that
1,joe is the only character in the film that could not have been a little longer,joe don baker has an incredible role as one of his students who are in a car
1,it was not a great film but it still made me angry,it is one of those movies that i think that should be seen
1,the only thing that kept me interested in,the story is not that great either
1,there is a reason why the film is a total waste of time,there 's a lot of good stuff in the script but not as well
1,when i saw this film i was n't expecting much,when i saw it in the theater the theater was a
1,guiness is a great character and he,guiness also appears in the film
1,it 's a pretty good movie,it 's a very simple story that
1,lorenzo lamas plays the character 's friend but i think he 's the worst character in,lorenzo mencia was the best and it was the only way to put on tv
1,it 's a shame the film is still a very enjoyable movie,it is a very moving film and is not only a movie about
1,i think this is one of the best comedies ever made,i would like to see that the director did n't get it
1,these guys have their own way of getting married and have no reason,these guys are a little more interesting than they were used to
1,this is not a movie to be missed by a wider audience,this film was not a total disaster but it was a good film
1,with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it looks like a bad project,with a cast of characters in one movie and a few minor characters the
1,it 's the same thing that made me mad,it also has many of the same themes of the
1,throwing in some of the best oneliners and the most hilarious moments you could ever have heard of,throwing the crap on the back of your head and then go back and see a movie that 's
1,serial killers are usually portrayed as a little bit more than the,serial killers are the most popular things in the entire flick
1,within the same time the movie takes you through the whole journey to see how a film,within the first ten minutes of this film we are introduced to an entirely different film
1,it is not a film about the consequences of the holocaust,it 's not a good movie but a bit slow
1,a lot of the movie is shot at,a good idea for a good film
1,i think he is a good director but i just do n't care for his work,i am amazed at how much i hated the film because it was a very funny experience
1,no doubt i could have had a little more money,no one is going for a moment or so
1,bennie is a very nice person who 's,bennie 's performance was a bit stilted
1,even the music is n't too good and the story is a bit contrived and it 's too,even the most ardent of characters are the same things with the exception of the first one
1,all in all a fun movie with great actors and great music,all in all this was a pretty good movie and it was a
1,but the movie is just too bad,but this is the first time i saw
1,worth watching for a good looking and very entertaining performance by a young caan,worth mentioning that the movie does n't make any sense at all it 's just
1,classe tous risques is a movie for its technical merit but the acting is terrible the direction is terrible the plot is worse,classe tous risques is a film that is n't only a film but a documentary of what happens in the last century
1,the story is about a girl who is trying to kill her sister,the plot is pretty much a rehash of the book which i thought was
1,it 's not a comedy to me but it does entertain me,it 's like a bunch of kids who are looking at the stars
1,of course it 's all about sex it is,of course they did n't have to use cgi effects
1,above average acting performances in this film is n't really all that good but it 's,above all it 's a good movie to show in a theater of a week
1,this movie has nothing going for it,this movie was not even that well made
1,mr hyde is a good character and he has a great deal of humor but he has,mr hyde is a man who has lost his wife 's life in an automobile accident
1,as for the acting and direction of the actors they were all very good,as for the movie itself it 's a great story and an enjoyable experience
1,now i know that it was filmed by the same person,now the plot is a little convoluted but it is n't
1,though the movie itself is not as good as other works it is a very good movie,though this movie is not about football it 's not a very bad film it does n't have
1,of course he 's not a bad guy or an antihero or the,of course there are a few scenes which are quite well done
1,all in all a fun movie and a great movie,all this has got for the good of the movie
1,as a fan of the original film i had to go see it to find out who was the good guy,as a child it was a little too much for me to enjoy a movie which was not so awful
1,the acting and acting are horrible,the film opens with an extended flashback
1,other characters are n't developed well,other than the fact that this movie
1,add to that a great deal of suspense and a great cast that 's worth mentioning that it does,add the worst acting ever and the movie goes down hill and is a complete waste of time
1,there is a scene where she goes on to the party with a woman to the woman who is,there is an underlying theme in this film that is the only reason i can watch it for
1,the film was made for video and i am glad i did,the plot was very interesting the actors were very good the story was
1,nobody seems to notice the plot and characters who have a very,nobody else has a great deal of time to do so
1,the movie has a very very very good cast,the film is a total waste of time
1,part of the reason i found this film to be one of the worst is the acting,part of the reason for this movie is that they are so funny they are funny
1,sadly the plot is a little weak,sadly it is n't that the movie is
1,he is n't as bad as the first one but not as bad but it is,he does not seem to be able to speak in any way shape or form
1,sadly the movie is a failure in itself,sadly i did n't know what to expect but
1,it is a very interesting experience to,it 's not that great either
1,the film is about a bunch of kids who are trying to steal a car in the middle of a lake and then find,the only thing that could save this mess from being a total disaster is that it 's not the worst of the bunch
1,you know what the director was thinking,you 're in my right mind
1,the only reason i gave this a,the story was very well done
1,a lot of the actors and actresses did not really work at all,a good story of a woman who is married to a woman in the
1,the acting is good with this movie and i think the script was written by someone who has not read,the film is a bit long and boring but it does a nice job of keeping the viewer engaged
1,full of clichs and a lot of things that are so bad they just,full of surprises and some of the funniest acting i 've ever seen
1,she is a great actress and is the best actress in,she is a good actor with a very different attitude
1,omar sharif is one of the most underrated actors ever in his career,omar epps is a great comedic director and it is n't easy to see
1,because i think that is the best way to describe this film,because of this movie i do n't know what the hell is going
1,what was the point of this film,what i got was a very dull movie
1,sure the movie 's plot is a little thin but it 's a good movie and the,sure i have seen all of the films that have been released in the united states
1,also the ending was pretty good though,also it 's not a bad movie but
1,it 's a shame to see a movie that is n't good,it is also a bit more realistic and the story of a boy
1,dear readers of all ages are not,dear god is i really wrong
1,the first thing that i noticed was the ending,the plot is very predictable but the acting is so
1,it is a story about the struggles,it is n't even the best
1,the story of a woman who is a woman and has a daughter who has to be one of her best,the movie 's plot is about a man who 's been kidnapped in a mental hospital in the middle of a war
1,they have a few scenes that are,they were not even so funny
1,i have not been so disappointed in the film since this is the only film i 've ever watched that is so incredibly boring,i was n't sure whether the film was a comedy but a lot of other movies i 've seen that are n't as bad
1,the movie has a very bad story and is n't really good enough,the only good thing that i can say about this movie is that it
1,he does n't have to make a movie of this sort,he also has a good friend to be a good actor and
1,but i have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the script and the direction,but the fact that it is a movie about a serial killer is not funny
1,stephen rea plays the character of a rich man and he 's a loner,stephen rea 's performance is so overthetop and the plot is so contrived it 's
1,tod browning 's direction is excellent,tod browning 's first starring feature director
1,i was a little shocked that i was n't watching it because i did n't care for the characters,i have no idea why the film has been made but it 's a movie i can watch
1,but i guess that 's a lot,but then there 's the story
1,totally devoid of originality or originality in any sense,totally lacking in this film the acting is superb
1,the script by eric roberts is a very bad one,the acting is good with some good acting and a few
1,the film does n't seem to get much better,the plot was so bad the acting worse the dialogue
1,powell is the only character who does n't speak,powell and pressburger are a very talented pair
1,the only way to describe this is that you can see the,the acting is so poor you ca n't help but laugh
1,i would n't have to be able to watch it for the first time but i have a feeling,i would like to see more of him but i would n't have seen him in anything else
1,the acting and acting are all very good,the plot is so bad that i could have
1,tommy swayze was a very bad actor as,tommy lee jones is in good form
1,so much of the time it was n't really a,so i guess i'm glad i saw this film
1,he is an actor who is a very talented actor and is one hell of an actor,he had the ability to make a movie of this type of guy that was in this movie
1,they have no idea how to use their own imagination,they were both funny and i liked how it was done
1,and what 's with the ending,and the film is a bit long
1,he has an incredible sense to play and the story does a good job,he is the only person in the cast that is a caricature of the entire
1,say it does n't take a lot more than it has,say the title and you will see it for yourself
1,this movie is just as funny and a bit cheesy,this movie does n't have to be a sequel to all
1,as the movie progresses i was very pleased,as a film it 's not the least bit
1,this is a movie about love and sacrifice,this movie had me on the edge of my
1,they do n't know how to fight the,they were just not the same actors
1,sometimes you do n't have a good story line,sometimes they get some of the worst dialogue i have
1,especially when the director is trying to get the message across and he 's really the man,especially for the first half hour and then we 're introduced to the main characters in the movie
1,that 's a little unfair to say i did n't like it but i liked the film very very,that 's why the movie 's plot is so predictable it 's just too stupid to be true
1,he was also a man who was able to do something,he does n't want to be so much of an idiot to
1,also the ending is a little abrupt,also the fact that the film is shot
1,the story is so thin that it 's difficult to understand how this could ever be seen as a comedy or a drama,the film is n't so bad as to be like a movie about a killer snowman who kills a girl on the street and
1,this movie is one of my favorites,this movie is a waste of my time
1,why is that the only reason why this,why does n't he kill the girl
1,the plot is a bit weak but there are some really nice twists in it,the only thing that was interesting in the first film was the way the characters interact
1,the movie is also the best in the history of cinema,the movie is not about a single mother and her daughter who
1,so the movie is set in the future and is,so the film is very much a horror film
1,when he arrives on his own he finds out that they do n't know what is going on,when i saw it i was really shocked at the amount of it and i really did n't expect
1,it would be a shame that such a movie,it 's a pretty good idea of the plot
1,i do n't think that anyone else can,i have never watched a film infuriated
1,this movie was one of the first,this is n't a good movie
1,bonnie hunt is a good movie and it 's not a bad movie but it 's good,bonnie hunt was the best i 've ever seen but not as bad as the other two thirds
1,it was a good idea to make a film about a family that has to be the one who,it 's not a film that you can see on the screen but it is not a movie
1,some of the scenes are so bad,some parts that do not seem to have
1,the film opens with some good shots,the plot was interesting and the characters in
1,produced and directed by george romero the director of,produced for television movie and the next film
1,and the ending which makes the whole thing so ridiculous that you can see the ending coming,and that is where a film that is going to end with a few good moments
1,spoiler spoilers ahead i saw this movie as a child,spoiler alert the plot has a bit of a mystery that
1,the story has a lot of twists and turns and,the first half of the story is quite interesting
1,they should n't have been there,they were not so lucky to be
1,the film does n't really have any real plot twists either,the only thing good about it is the fact that it was
1,if that was n't all that would have been the point,if you can get a few more laughs from the audience then
1,also in the cast are the great barbara,also there 's a lot of gore
1,unfortunately this is the only movie that has it 's own good points,unfortunately the film 's plot has the potential to be the worst movie ever
1,the film was shot on the cheap and the sets were very cheap in the editing department,the film is about four women in a small rural village and the first thing that has been
1,by the end i was thinking of the film as a whole i had the opportunity to watch this film,by that i was n't a fan of the first two but still i think it 's an absolute pleasure to
1,now i have to give the two lead actors a credit for trying to emulate the fact that this show has a lot of potential,now i'm glad i did n't pay the bills to see it on my local cable station or maybe it would have been a little too
1,do n't waste time with this,do n't expect anything resembling the same
1,while the film is a little too slow paced i found that it was not the first movie i,while it is the most obvious example of this genre i have to admit i was not disappointed
1,the film does have an interesting ending but,the acting in the lead was superb
1,but it just makes me cry for a long time,but the movie 's plot is a little too simple to
1,i am glad i saw this movie,i saw it on the sundance channel when
1,in this case i was n't expecting a great movie to be a good movie,in the end i felt that the film could have been a bit better but the
1,but this movie is a complete waste of time,but i ca n't help but wonder how he got
1,see how the movie is shot in the future with the camera,see how the producers should be allowed to show up on their cv
1,so it 's a movie that you can find funny,so what do we get when we are talking about that
1,seemed to have been thrown in by the director 's intent of making a,seemed to me a bit more like a movie than a horror movie
1,somebody in the movie was either mentally retarded or,somebody is entitled the best in the film
1,for the first time in time i still think this movie is the best,for instance when a woman has her hair stashed in her chest the film is
1,dirk bogarde 's performance as john is superb,dirk bogarde and his wife are two of the
1,notable performances and a few moments of hilarity make this a very enjoyable,notable actors like john carradine john goodman william sadler and ray milland
1,this is a film about the holocaust 's struggle to,this movie is just a bad waste of time
1,the movie has no plot or character development whatsoever just a little underdeveloped,the film also features a few scenes that are so powerful and touching that
1,each of the actors are a bunch of amateurs who ca n't act,each of these people is the one who has a good relationship with him
1,seems like a bunch of amateurs from the same time,seems to have been made on a cheap budget but the
1,that 's why i gave it a 10 instead of a 3,that 's the only reason why this movie is a classic
1,that 's all there is to this,that 's not saying a lot
1,it 's a very good and entertaining film and it 's not,it 's a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon
1,omg i do n't know where to begin,omg i do n't know what to say about
1,i think it is the funniest show i have ever seen,i was really shocked at how well this is a great action
1,the film is about three men who go to war in order to,the film also features an interesting premise and the cast and crew
1,she plays the mother of a rich woman who is a little over her head and has her love for,she has to make sure that she 's a little too much but she 's still the smartest thing
1,another reason the film is so bad is when you 're not in trouble with the movie,another one of those films about the evils of war and how they are made to be one
1,the story is about a man who 's going into possession and is,the only thing that kept me watching was the acting and directing
1,but it 's just as entertaining as it,but it was so funny to me
1,diahann page has a nice cameo here,diahann 's character is a bit too shallow
1,it is also about how difficult it is to make a movie and how the,it 's an interesting idea to have a good story and a great cast
1,this is n't a movie to see if you 're a fan,this is a film that you can watch with your friends
1,well the first time i saw him in this,well this show is not a bad idea
1,there are a few funny moments but overall it is a very boring and boring movie,there was a scene where the main character is talking about being dead and he was supposed
1,luckily i am a fan of movies such as the exorcist which i saw so,luckily i found the whole idea of the movie was a joke to me
1,none of the films have a great sense,none of the actors are very good
1,i think that the movie is a masterpiece to,i have n't laughed in a single scene
1,destroying the first film the other actors are very good,destroying the movie for a few minutes it was made for
1,the movie is about the power that was the main character,the story is about two young men who have to cope with
1,yeah i know i 've seen a lot worse than it actually was,yeah that 's right the story is so bad it 's almost funny
1,treacly and the acting is great,treacly and the movie is a great
1,the movie has the most obvious and unbelievable story lines ever put into film,the first thing i noticed about this film is that it is not only the
1,just do n't expect it to be the first movie,just a lot of action and a lot of action
1,things go sour with no apparent explanation to his own actions,things are going on like the frogs who are n't really the
1,nevertheless i think it was a mistake to see this film and i must say that,nevertheless there 's a lot of the usual stuff and the movie does not work
1,and then there is the fact that the story is about the,and i 've always found the movie to be very entertaining
1,so if you want to see a truly funny film that i would recommend to those who want to see a great,so the movie has an almost comical premise and does a pretty good job at making it a bit too slow
1,maintaining the sense of humor and humour that makes a film such an interesting premise and a,maintaining an interesting message the film 's only saving grace is the presence of the characters
1,the story is so predictable and predictable,the movie starts out with a group of
1,and that is what the film is like,and it seems that they were n't going to
1,in this film we see that he has a lot of problems with his life and his actions,in the first movie the characters are a bit twodimensional but the characters are likable and believable
1,they were both the main character and the two main actors who were in their early,they 're all so stupid and have been so hard to find anything to do
1,the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that the movie had so many clichs in it that it was,the first half of the movie shows what a good job it is that he is in love with his wife
1,things begin to get complicated and when the killer comes up a little to kill the girl he 's just a,things do n't get much more interesting when they 're in the dark and the movie starts to fall apart
1,this has to be the funniest movie i 've ever seen,this show is the most interesting thing in the movie
1,you do have that honor and you 'll,you know what 's going to happen
1,i am a huge fan of the original,i think the best part of this movie is
1,throw the cast in a film that makes you want to throw a few bucks out your throat,throw in some random sex scenes a few scenes in which the killer tries hard and the movie ends
1,so the movie goes on to a different extent,so what if the director had n't made a movie
1,the movie does have one of the strangest endings ever captured but it does n't,the script is very good and the performances are all pretty good although i have seen
1,she 's a great actress in the movie,she was also the only one who had to
1,allred 's films are a real pleasure,allred 's films are so bad they are
1,it 's a shame that this film did n't win a razzie award for best picture,it 's a pretty good movie and a great film to watch in a hurry
1,but this film is n't as much as the first one,but there is a lot of action in this film and a
1,sometimes they just seem to be a bit too old to,sometimes you just want to laugh at the tv show
1,the movie is n't even about a man who is so obsessed with his life as a man and a woman,the acting is n't as bad as it should be but the actors are very good especially the lead actress who is
1,when i saw the movie i thought it would make an interesting statement,when the movie was released it was a complete disaster of the first film
1,matthau is the real reason to watch this and while the first time around was n't,matthau and his friends have a great deal of fun with each other 's characters
1,he has to be the most intelligent,he is a very talented actor
1,my wife who was also in the movie theater and,my favorite is that they have the same actors
1,publicity to the us government in the united states to,publicity of the title is a very good movie
1,this has to be one of the best films i have ever seen,this movie makes one think that a bunch of friends would be a little
1,the movie also features some very good actors but i think the actors should not be,the movie is not for everyone who loves the genre and you will love it
1,ca n't wait for this movie to come out,ca n't even get out of the way
1,every time he appears at one time or another they are just as stupid to watch as they did in their movies and they,every time he gets his hands on the head of his own family it becomes a bit of a distraction to the audience
1,guys in the theater are not the most interesting people that i have ever seen,guys do n't even try to talk about the real world and this is the worst
1,portraying the young girl who 's supposed to be his sister and the girl who 's been married to his son and his mother in a way that is,portraying this film and the two other people who are in the theater is very different and very different from today other films about the evils of war
1,read the book the plot is a,read my comment on this site
1,in the end it 's all a matter of what the movie 's character is and what it 's trying to do,in a scene he 's just trying to make an appearance out of his character and is not a real person
1,finally the two of them were in the first one,finally this film does have the best parts of the whole
1,you do n't know that you 're in for a,you 'll have to see it to believe it
1,better luck to the other two,better still the film is quite well
1,garner is a great actor and i hope he can bring it in more,garner is not the only one in the movie so he 's a little more
1,the acting is pretty good and the story line is great,the film 's story is based on a true story
1,i am a fan of the show,i was n't surprised that i did n't
1,no other film has a similar plot and the two,no matter how hard it gets you to think
1,driven by the fact that this was not the case,driven by the presence of his mother he is unable to
1,max steiner is excellent as the conflicted detective who 's always been married to her,max steiner 's character in this film has an affinity for what he says about his
1,can you tell me how to do the film,can anyone tell me why i was so impressed
1,despite the fact that i do have some of the other comments i 've been,despite being made in the first place i think this was a great effort
1,some of these actors are a bit too stiff,some of the actors seem pretty bad in their own
1,however the movie is not a comedy at all,however it is a movie that has no redeeming value
1,it 's a shame to hear more about the story,it was so bad you could n't tell how the movie
1,those who have seen the film know that this film is based on true events which is,those that are familiar with the story will probably not appreciate the story of the film
1,the film is also a bit more enjoyable than the usual suspects that are being made,the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 was that for the opening sequence
1,i have seen it many times in my lifetime and it 's a great movie to see,i was a huge fan of the movie in a way i was a fan of the first
1,i would love to know what the director of this was thinking when it was made but i did n't have to be the,i saw this movie for the first time last night and was amazed to discover that it was made on a low budget
1,this is a pretty bad movie,this one is so funny it hurts
1,sometimes i do n't think this is,sometimes they 're not the best
1,in my opinion the film is so bad that you can barely tell,in fact the movie was so bad that it was just bad
1,i have seen some bad movie before but then again what i did n't like was,i was expecting the best to come out of my mouth but that was it
1,probably one of the best movies i have seen this year,probably the most memorable thing i have to say to people who
1,the film is a bit over the top and the movie 's plot is just a,the plot is a bit of an excuse but it 's also a fun movie
1,in fact the movie has a few faults in it too bad the actors,in the end i did n't see any character development in the movie
1,danning 's character is the same,danning was the perfect choice for her
1,the only reason i could rate this movie higher than 10 is,the film has a very simple story and is very entertaining
1,well this is a good family movie that i think is the best,well it was a little over and over and on the back
1,all in all this film was a disappointment,all the while i am not a fan of
1,it 's a movie that makes you want to go home,it does n't seem to be that this is not a great
1,the acting is good but the script is so awful that i was forced to give it ten,the movie is a bit of a mess but it does not have much of a plot
1,sybil danning as usual does n't really have any of the qualities,sybil danning plays a character who is supposed to be an actress who
1,ann sheridan was excellent in it,ann is the best of the bunch
1,this movie was n't bad either,this film is a must see
1,but that 's the only reason i can enjoy this,but the movie just is not a good one
1,this is a pretty good film,this movie was so horrible that i
1,it 's a movie that should not be taken seriously,it 's just that there 's a lot of fun here
1,the acting is so awful that it 's laughable,the film does a good job of dealing in some
1,anyway a film like this that is not so good as it 's just made the movie a,anyway i would have to say that this is one of those films with bad special effects
1,vanity and the film is a very good film about a man who lives on his wife 's roof and finds his body,vanity and prejudice is an important point to the film and i think that it is not the most widely regarded film to be
1,in this movie we are presented with a bunch of very funny and funny,in the end i thought the movie was good but that 's all
1,bill pullman is a great villain,bill bixby plays a character who gets
1,this was the best movie i have ever seen,this is one movie that should never be made
1,when i first saw this movie i was not expecting much from the director and i was,when the movie was n't a success for the first time it was a great show
1,patrick swayze does a good job of portraying the main characters but he is also quite,patrick stewart is a wonderful actor and i liked how he 's in the movie
1,that 's why i think it is,that is why i love it
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and then the movie turns into a boring
1,but i think that the actors should go back to,but this one is a complete waste of time
1,it is the most beautiful film i 've ever,it is also the best of the three
1,in fact the movie is a total insult to all of,in fact the movie is so bad it is funny
1,it 's just a little bit of a stretch to get out of the film,it 's just a waste of time and i think it would have been better if
1,he is also the most annoying character in the movie,he is the most interesting person of the world
1,its a very very long movie and,its a movie you should watch
1,they do n't seem to be trying too hard to be serious but they never get a real job of any sort,they do n't even try to hide the whole plot of the story but the movie has to be the worst thing that
1,after a while they decide to get a few laughs and the only reason they are not the killer is because there 's some really funny stuff,after all the movie is a comedy and an examination of the life of a young woman who loves to have sex with her parents and is trying
1,when i saw a preview i was surprised that the director could have been a good actress and not just the script writer,when she gets a job at the local mall she goes home to her home town and her new wife 's life
1,if you can find something to laugh at here is an enjoyable movie that i recommend to anyone with an open,if you are a fan of the tv series then you 're missing out on a lot of the humor
1,this movie is a must see for anyone looking,this is one that i do n't like
1,carter is in fact the worst man ever in a movie and he has the most irritating character in it,carter plays a role in the film that makes him a great actor as his career as an actor
1,beautiful scenery of a small town in a small village where people are on a,beautiful and funny the whole film is a dream and a very funny one
1,gary oldman plays a very creepy character that 's all he could do in,gary oldman has a good performance here as he was in the movie
1,it 's just a shame because it is n't as bad as it is,it 's a great story but it 's not a comedy and a good movie
1,does he have an eye for the whole thing and it 's not a movie,does he really do it with a lot of his other movies like that
1,and it is n't that it is so bad they just do n't make the mistake,and the ending was so ridiculous i was left wondering what happened in the end
1,illiterate and old and his son who,illiterate is a very good movie
1,for all the wrong reasons you should n't be fooled by this movie,for the most part the characters are very likable and very interesting
1,the only good thing about this movie is the music,the story itself is a little weak but it has a
1,quite an enjoyable and entertaining movie that will appeal to all ages,quite a bit of the film in its simplicity and a few scenes
1,my only question is if this was a sequel,my friends and i were watching this film and i
1,sure he has some kind of good luck,sure the movie is a little over the top
1,i 've always been a huge fan of the original film of the same title,i 've always liked the film 's humor and the humor of the show but it
1,having said the same for the whole movie it is a good movie,having been in the military of a very high school and having been able
1,he is a fine director with an incredible eye but he,he is a great actor with a lot of fun
1,alongside all these elements i would say it is a little slow and not worth a,alongside his previous movies this one is a great example of the genre of film
1,timothy spall is a great actor,timothy spall as his brother is as
1,it is not even that much,it was not even a good movie
1,in addition to a good movie the acting was,in fact it has nothing to recommend it
1,the only thing i liked about the movie is that it is a complete bore to boot,the story is not really about the characters they are trying to do but it 's not as
1,can you imagine that this is the first movie i 've ever seen before,can the film makers invest a little bit of time into the script
1,since i am a fan i have n't seen this movie in a long time,since this was a long run in my head i had high hopes for this film
1,well i was really impressed with this movie,well it does n't seem to make any sense
1,this is not a movie for anyone who does n't like to laugh,this is one of those films where the story seems to be based on
1,chalk it up with a good story and great,chalk it up to it 's original cast
1,of course the film has no real meaning but the director does n't really make much sense to,of course he 's not a bad guy but a good guy is not a good guy
1,as for the film itself it 's not that bad but not as good as in the first two films,as a result of his childhood he has been a successful actor since he is in a movie and he seems
1,even the actors who do n't seem to have a lot of fun to make up for this is a good movie for those that have,even if the movie is n't as much as a comedy it 's a very funny movie that will appeal to anyone with a brain
1,possible spoiler ahead spoilers ahead i saw the movie at the amsterdam theatre festival in,possible spoilers ahead of course it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i saw this movie on the shelf and i was,i do n't know why this film was made
1,exactly because it 's not a horror movie it 's a very,exactly because i do n't want to get into that movie
1,so the movie is n't a big success,so if you are looking for a funny movie
1,the movie is not only a great vehicle for the movie but it 's a very good story,the only thing good about this film is that you can see the whole thing with the actors and
1,the film is a very good and touching film,the story is simple but the characters are likable and
1,there are a couple of interesting scenes but there is no real chemistry between them,there are some interesting twists but there are some moments that make you laugh out loud
1,from what i 've seen from the first film i was n't sure whether there was ever something that was wrong with this movie,from the first moment i saw the movie the first time i watched it was the cover of my dvd collection in the video stores
1,as a result the whole thing was pretty funny,as a movie i think this is one of those
1,the only way to enjoy it was to watch the original lonesome dove which,the film is very funny though but it 's not all that bad
1,the film is about a woman named seita who goes from a mental breakdown and ends up being a little disturbed at the,the acting is so bad and you 're left with the feeling that this film has n't been seen by any means
1,if they had a chance to see this film i 'd have given it a 1 if the film had stayed for a decent audience,if you 're going to watch a good movie that does n't have a plot and a good story this one is for you
1,and that 's what the movie is,and the movie 's only redeeming feature in
1,i do n't know how it was n't that great it,i am surprised it has never been released on dvd
1,as the movie begins you have to be in a state of disbelief to see what the director has to work with the script is,as a matter of fact the story itself was so stupid that it 's hard to tell who is the killer and the story
1,now i am a fan of the tv series and i think that the movie has been very good,now that 's why it 's just as bad and boring as it is and you can see the end
1,it was a good idea to show a lot of the scenes and i think,it is a movie that has to be made in a year or two
1,it was a great movie for me,it was a great movie and it was
1,forget about any other film this is an excellent film and,forget it you 'll have a good time watching this
1,we are not alone in the world or our lives in the country,we all have to be a bit more forgiving to the characters and the
1,the story and the characters are well developed and well done,the movie was a bit too short for me but the director
1,i think that it is not a great movie and the director is also the first to have a great deal of time to come,i would like to give a 0 out of 10 if it was n't for the fact that i saw it at the toronto film festival
1,high school graduation is a great piece of work,high school is not a bad thing and the actors
1,note how this is not a film for a film of any kind,note it had to be one of the worst movies ever made
1,strangely enough he did n't seem to have any sense of humour and was not funny at all,strangely the acting is terrible the script is awful the script is terrible and the script is a disgrace
1,in short it is a pretty bad movie which i do not think i 've ever seen,in the end it is a very enjoyable movie with great performances by the actors and a good
1,well worth mentioning but you have to go to a movie,well this is the only way to watch this movie
1,unlike many of the others the film does have its strengths,unlike this and other films i was expecting a little more from
1,it 's not even worth watching if you have,it 's not a very good movie either
1,this movie was not made for the,this is not a good film
1,this is a movie of the highest calibre,this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
1,because it is not for everyone but it 's a nice little film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action,because of the great performances by all the actors and actresses and this movie is not a good movie it is a very
1,the movie is a bit slow in,the film was very well made
1,it 's a shame that the film 's only redeemable flaw,it is an excellent film and one of the few
1,by the time it came out in the uk i was n't sure who it was and,by the time it was over i was n't aware how much i enjoyed the film
1,its a very interesting and enjoyable movie,its the most stupid thing i 've ever
1,future generations of the director of the film were also responsible for the death of the young man,future generations of the time are the only thing we know that they do n't have as much as
1,but it 's not a film that is n't,but the movie does n't work at all
1,plot summary for a new movie,plot line is not bad enough to
1,this is a film of the highest quality of the genre,this is just another film that i 've never seen before and
1,of course there is no denying that there 's some sort of moral message here,of course it 's the fact that she 's been in the movie business
1,it 's a very funny film,it was so bad it was bad
1,both of the actors were also the most talented in the film as well as a couple of supporting players that,both the director and the screenwriter and crew had a great time making this movie as well as the original
1,gold is about the only thing that can do,gold has no real reason to see it
1,i do not understand where to begin,i was n't expecting the same kind of
1,this one is a complete waste of time,this movie makes me want to be entertained
1,i saw this movie on a friday night with the lights in your eyes and then i had a good time watching it,i saw this at the tribeca film festival and i have to say it 's not as bad as the other movies it is
1,in the end i could n't help but feel that the film would be better,in this case the only good part of the film is the scene of the girl
1,oh and there 's some nice gore and some pretty gruesome stuff,oh yeah this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,but there were some really cool moments and the acting was good,but the movie is about as exciting as a trip to a time
1,instead it makes a mockery of the movie 's plot and character development,instead the plot is simple and the characters are n't developed to care about
1,they all have a good time,they should have had it in their
1,the movie itself was a bit choppy and the story line was too contrived to be interesting it was a bit of,the movie is about a group of teenagers who decide to take a trip to the woods to save their lives
1,this is one hell of a fun movie,this is a film for all ages of those
1,the film has an enormous cast of characters that have some of the best dialogue i have ever seen,the script is also a bit of an attempt to make the movie look good or worse it just does
1,its a shame that the movie is not as,its just a waste of time watching it
1,even a little bit of nudity is the main reason i did,even the most ardent of actors can act as the actors
1,this is the only film that has to offer it 's audience 's favorite score of the film,this movie is a great movie that is very well worth watching for the good acting and a great
1,first of all i 'd rather see,first off there 's the story
1,similar to it and the original version of the film was the first of the series,similar to the book i read the book i saw the first one and was very surprised
1,in fact i 've been watching the whole movie for quite some while browsing the theater and seeing a good film and i can safely watch the whole thing,in fact i think the best parts of this movie were the two main character actors and their performances and their performances were quite convincing in their roles
1,similarly the director should have been able to make a feature film that is more than just,similarly this film is a bit of an exercise in the way the film is portrayed
1,they are all very good in their respective ways and it,they have been on their way into the pakistan war
1,should have been made a little more interesting for the director and the,should it be because of how he 's not in this film
1,why would the police have such a good,why would you want to see this
1,its not even a good movie,its a shame that the writers had
1,i 've seen the first one and that has to be said in my mind,i was n't a fan of this series because i was n't impressed with the story
1,i do n't know what the director thought but i have no idea how the story unfolds,i think it is an excellent movie that has the same kind of feel that is in the
1,sure it has some of the best music and music i 've ever heard on film,sure there were moments when the character was killed but there was so nothing to be desired
1,if you 're going to make a documentary about,if you have not yet seen this movie
1,a good film with good actors and a decent performance from a good cast,a lot of people are saying that this movie is one of the worst movies
1,it would be interesting if the film had a more realistic ending and would 've made some more of the impact of the,it is very much like a tv series of the twilight zone and the only ones who are n't are the same
1,stay away from this mess of a movie if,stay as far away from home as possible
1,not that it 's not a good movie but it 's still not as bad as the first,not only is it a waste of time and money but for some reason you will have to sit
1,ben chaplin 's performance in the film is a,ben stiller was a real joy to watch
1,he does n't have enough money to go back to his family,he does n't want to do anything and his son is a suspect
1,the film starts with a very long prologue and,the film is a complete waste of time
1,she is not the least bit attractive,she 's just the girl who has the
1,christopher walken was good as a bad guy,christopher lloyd is great and it is a shame
1,i do n't understand why so many people have commented on this movie,i have n't seen anything from this guy in a long time
1,the movie has an allstar cast and,the movie has an allstar cast
1,especially if it was n't that the actors did n't,especially the one thing that makes this film watchable
1,yes this is one of the worst movies i have seen but it 's not that good,yes the movie is a little bit of a comedy but it 's not that good
1,danila was n't even that great and was not a bad idea,danila is a young woman who gets her comeuppance as the mother for
1,it is not a very interesting film,it 's just not worth it
1,i am so glad i did,i have never seen anything so great
1,you 'll have to see a movie with an open mind,you do n't even get to know the characters and the actors
1,perry is an excellent actor and his character is a very interesting actor,perry has to contend with a group of young men and their friends
1,he 's just a jerk in this movie,he is a fine actor with the ability and
1,its just that the whole film is so bad and that,its like a movie that 's a little too much
1,then we learn that the only reason for the murders is to,then the story starts unfolding with the characters of the characters
1,later on he 's trying to save her and he finds a way to get her to leave him,later the film is full of bad guys and bad acting bad acting bad special effects bad acting the worst
1,my only complaint is that most of the actors are not the actors in the movie,my advice for the dvd version is that you can find a copy of this film on
1,overall it 's a great movie,overall the movie was good and some
1,on the other hand the movie is very funny,on the plus side it is a little slow moving
1,but this is a film that will appeal to everyone involved,but i would love to see that in the future
1,ann 's sister is a very strong woman but it does n't work in the least bit,ann sheridan is great as the mother 's wife and the mother who does not seem to be
1,after seeing the trailer you 'll get a good story,after the movie was over i realized that it was a
1,when she arrives in the city she finds a man who is the reincarnation of an old lady that has been abused by a woman who is in love with the young man,when a little girl is killed by a car accident with the help of the local police detective the two detectives find that they can afford their money to go out to the police
1,god i do n't think he 's a genius but it is the best,god bless me this is n't my favorite movie but it is a very bad
1,the plot was very original and i loved that movie,the film 's premise is a little farfetched but the acting
1,when they arrive at the cabin of a local street and their,when the movie started this movie did not work for me
1,honestly if you are looking for the best movie ever made and the ones,honestly i was surprised that the story was not so much more complex
1,lord of the rings is not a movie about an,lord of the rings trilogy does not have it
1,if you want to watch a movie like that it does a good job explaining the concept of a movie and what is wrong with,if you 're looking for a movie where a bunch of friends are trapped in an isolated house then this one is for you
1,meryl streep is great as the woman who loves her,meryl streep and james stewart give excellent performances and the supporting
1,costar and the guy who played the lead,costar john carradine is a great actor but he
1,i do n't think that the director 's intention was to make a statement,i do n't know what the real thing is that 's the way the characters
1,this is one of those movies which i would watch,this film was a waste of time and money
1,caleb 's son and the other tenants are just the right people who do,caleb and his mate are the best and funniest characters in the film
1,lets talk about the ending and the end of the story,lets hope he 's on screen it 's not that bad
1,basically the film is a complete mess of,basically this film is n't bad enough
1,my advice is to watch another film if not for the sake of the audience,my favorite character is the father who is also an alcoholic and a little kid
1,the film 's main flaw is to make the viewer feel that the film,the acting is good and it is n't the worst movie ever made
1,there 's a good cast and a few good moments,there is also something about mary 's character who is a
1,their character is a joke and the plot does n't really come together but the movie is still a great movie that 's worth watching as,their performances are excellent but the film 's lack of focus is given to the film by an amateur cast that is n't really good
1,this movie is a must see,this movie has a very funny scene
1,the only thing i liked about this movie was the way in which the characters were in the book which,the film is also notable in the fact that it 's a comedy that does n't work for everyone
1,some of the scenes are very funny but the rest is just awful,some people may think that the acting is good but not the best
1,i was surprised at the lack of realism,i would have been surprised to find out that
1,i have no problem with this movie,i am surprised by it 's ability to
1,it 's the kind of film you can watch at your local video,it seems the film is a spoof of the original the exorcist
1,we do n't even care about the actors,we all have our own reason for this film
1,i think the problem with this film is that it lacks any real suspense or excitement,i have been looking for a film that is n't bad but still has a sense of
1,even though the movie is n't as interesting as other reviewers i have n't seen much of anything else,even if you do n't believe that the movie 's true value is that it 's a little over the
1,my favorite scene was when one of the boys is walking,my wife and my friends have never watched this show
1,this movie is about two men who are in paris and together,this is one of the best animated movies of all time
1,but i guess you do n't have to see a movie that makes you,but i guess it was n't a good idea to get the movie
1,i do n't think that this movie is a total waste but rather,i 've seen some pretty bad films and i was very surprised
1,let 's start with the fact that you do n't need to,let 's just say the last 20 minutes are pretty good
1,and it 's like a cross between the first,and then there 's another woman who is trying to
1,my friend rented it on the video store for the first time,my wife and i both loved this movie and it made me want
1,nostalgia is the most difficult thing in all of the films,nostalgia has a lot of action but it has to be the
1,i would n't have to say this,i was n't expecting to see more of
1,a very good movie with good acting,a lot of things i 've read about
1,too many of the characters are too stupid,too bad it is n't even funny
1,otherwise the story line is not a bad movie as is most of the time it takes on the genre and it 's not even the first time it happens,otherwise the film is just plain horrible the only saving grace is that it has no redeeming quality whatsoever and that includes some of the funniest scenes in the last 20
1,all the actors are very convincing,all i have to do is make
1,its not a good film but it does a good job representing the issues that occur,its a shame that i was able to sit through a lot of the movie
1,there are many many things that make this movie a classic,there is some sort of a story involving the man who is
1,however the only thing that makes it worth watching for is the acting of the two leads,however there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't care how many times i
1,the film does contain a very interesting story line with some of the most intriguing characters i have ever seen,the first half of the movie shows the true colors of the characters of the film and how they are made
1,they 're all very good and have a great deal,they are not funny or even interesting to watch
1,few people have seen it and i do agree,few have done it but i 've heard that they
1,in the end we see him and the other characters being tortured by their parents,in fact the film is quite short as a whole the story is not very interesting
1,ironically the story and the acting are just terrible,ironically the film has been released on dvd and vhs
1,i was expecting a lot from my favorite movie of the last 20 years but the acting was,i do n't think that any other actor could have been a more talented and talented director
1,cruel skin was one of the movies that i had heard of that,cruel intentions were so rare that the audience could identify with the story
1,trust me you have n't heard of it,trust me on this it 's the best film
1,the plot has been done by a bunch of other people,the first film is about a group of young people from the
1,dakota fanning is excellent as the main,dakota fanning plays her part well
1,all in this one of those movies that is a little more than a comedy,all in all it 's a pretty fun film and it 's definitely a fun movie
1,that 's the best part of this film,that said the only good things about this movie
1,this movie is a great example of,this movie is just another movie
1,then there is the plot of the film itself and it becomes more and more apparent that,then there is an excellent performance from robert de niro as the conflicted and treacherous man
1,this is a great movie that is a must see for anyone interested in the genre of the,this movie was so bad that i had to stop watching and i did n't like it
1,he was a great director who was n't afraid to use a lot of his movies to get his audience,he 's got a very very small part but he is n't as good as he was the villain
1,first off this is a very boring and boring movie with a very weak plot,first of all the movie has a lot of action and a lot of gore scenes
1,they are just as annoying and boring,they are so bad in the way that
1,if you want to see a movie with a few laughs that will make you laugh then this is the movie for you,if you have seen a couple of films you 've seen in the past ten years or a few times but you can appreciate
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie has the best of the worst movies i have ever seen,i'm a huge fan of the original series and the original version was so bad it was a waste of time for those
1,fonda plays a young woman who gets into trouble,fonda 's performance as a man is not the best
1,although the story is quite good there 's no real plot and it seems that the director of photography is a very poor director,although i am not a fan of the original and the film 's original i can safely say i was n't going to go and
1,watch it for what it is a good,watch it and you will be hooked
1,the acting in this one is great,the acting is very good and the story
1,the acting is horrible at best and worst of all the film is a complete waste of time,the story is about a man searching for her missing son who gets to her home in the year
1,i would say that this movie has been done many times so far as i 've seen a few times i do admire the fact that it,i think the main reason why i give this film 2 out of 10 is because i did n't have a clue what was going on
1,spoilers spoilers ahead there was a twist,spoilers below this movie is an absolute mustsee
1,i am not even sure if it 's just the fact that it is n't so well done but i suppose that,i think that 's why i gave this movie a 3 because the plot was so bad it 's almost laughable
1,this is a movie that should be seen by everyone interested,this movie is about the same subject as this movie
1,he has been in the military for many years,he has a very good voice and voice
1,do n't worry to watch this film,do n't bother renting it unless you have
1,while a couple of scenes are shot out of their mouths i found the whole thing to be an interesting experience,while it does have some good points the acting is pretty weak and that does n't make it a bad movie at
1,this movie is a real winner because of the sheer,this movie is a complete waste of my time
1,not only is he a complete failure,not even the gore effects are n't bad
1,but it 's a good movie,but the real story is a lot
1,ken russell is a very funny actor and he is the best in the whole movie,ken loach has a great job in making a film that makes a good film but he
1,one of the most enjoyable scenes was when he and his father and sister meet a couple of the girls,one thing i do want to say is that this is a very good movie and should be seen by anyone
1,slightly more than a movie of sorts this one is a very enjoyable one,slightly of course the story itself is a bit confusing but it 's a very
1,every character is a stereotype and the actors are the only real standout moments of this film,every episode is just as bad and the jokes are n't that funny or funny but that 's
1,these are all the same people that have been in the world in the,these two characters are all very well developed and their performances are excellent
1,here he was an actor with a lot of screen time but he is a bit too bland,here we get a movie about how the world will be done and the future is a very different
1,instead of the typical american horror movie it is a bunch of people doing nothing to distinguish themselves from their own,instead of the usual stereotypes that have been done so many times in the past few years they have n't really got
1,the story is a bit of an improvement,the movie does n't get any worse
1,while i ca n't stand up to any of the others this is a great show,while watching the whole thing it 's a nice touch to see a movie like this which
1,he is n't in that one as he has the smarts of his own character to,he plays a character that is very well portrayed by the very talented robert redford
1,and then they cut off the screen,and what 's worse the film
1,not to mention the fact that he was in love with someone who is not a very good actor,not to mention the fact that the movie has an extended cameo by the director of one of the most
1,however the story is about a woman who is engaged in her father 's life,however the film is not so much that it seems to be a little too long
1,why was the movie even so bad,why would a man in the audience be
1,can you imagine a film where a character in the movie is supposed,can you get the feeling the movie is a little too long
1,if you 're looking for a movie that you can sit through over and over again then this is,if they do n't know how to act a bit they 're probably more interested in the film
1,the story is a little convoluted but it is a movie that does n't make any difference,the acting was good the acting was good and the direction of the movie was excellent
1,nick stahl as the cop in charge of this movie is a hoot to,nick nolte is a delight as the character he plays in this film
1,however the film is still very well done and is worth,however i found the ending to be a bit unsatisfying
1,but i do n't have much of a plot line,but it 's all too bad that it 's the only
1,the story is about the search that goes into a man who is,the acting is very good and the characters are believable to boot
1,though the film is not a comedy it is a complete piece of propaganda,though the film is very dated with the fact that it is a film it
1,but the real thing here is the acting,but this film was a total disaster
1,the movie is a little bit slow but the acting is,the film does n't really make any sense at all
1,whether or not they were the same man and that was the,whether you like the show or not you 'll love it
1,this is one of those films where it is so,this was not a movie i would watch again
1,fbi agent james woods has a very small and short time as a hero in the movie,fbi agent james woods is a cop who tries to kill and rape people with a shady attitude
1,rebecca and her boyfriend get a job for each other 's murder,rebecca 's performance as an american actress in the film was just too
1,another thing i can say is that this film is a total insult to the intelligence and the intelligence of the human condition,another thing i can understand is that there is n't any character development to speak of and there is no real story
1,however this film does n't get much attention at the very beginning and the end credits are,however i was n't too young and i would love to see more of her work
1,i 've watched this movie countless times,i would n't recommend this to people
1,snatching your eyes for the most you 're not going to have,snatching the eyes and make sure it 's your own fault
1,everyone else is just a stereotype,everyone else seems to go to the
1,i do n't know what the people were talking about but i do n't know why they did,i was hoping to see some pretty interesting scenes but i was n't sure where to begin
1,he is an actor of a kind,he 's not as great as the first
1,larry 's mother is n't a happy child she 's a little more than a little too nerdy to be a,larry is an expert who is a loner and he is a little bit reluctant to be in his home
1,that 's what the movie does,that 's the point of the film
1,the film 's premise is about a young man named sam who is trying to solve,the film is a very funny movie that should have been called upon the holocaust
1,the first half of the film is an extended prologue of the film,the movie starts off with a couple of good jokes from the first movie
1,as it turns out she 's the killer,as a result the movie is very slow
1,do not expect to watch anything in the film that,do we need more of this sort of film
1,i do n't remember the last time i saw this movie so,i think the movie is a little too long for me
1,in the meantime i have a soft and soft spot in my mouth,in the end it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's a pity because it 's so bad that they just do n't make movies like this anymore,it 's just that the story has n't been done before and it has been done by the same guy
1,there 's not even a single moment where the film does n't seem to have,there is no plot no character development no real story and no character development
1,do n't bother with this one,do n't waste your time with this
1,an excellent movie for those who want,an example of a great film
1,so much of the dialogue is just so ridiculous and contrived it 's hard,so what we get to see is what the filmmakers have to say
1,i'm a fan of the book and i have,i'm sorry but i have no idea why
1,if you like it you should be able to watch this movie and do not,if you want the two hour of your life this is a must see
1,still a very well worth the effort and money,still i have seen it and i think it was
1,i'm sure that i would love to see more of the series in the series,i'm not a fan of the original series but there is a fair amount of action
1,almost everything about it is bad bad and not funny,almost everything in this movie was awful the music was annoying
1,the only redeeming factor in it is the acting,the plot line and acting was all pretty good but
1,but the movie is not about the war,but if you are looking for something like a
1,i think this movie should be shown on the big screen,i am sure the film 's producers had a chance to get
1,some of the acting was pretty cheesy and i would have liked to have seen some of it,some may say that the movie is a bit cheesy and not as good or even worse
1,to me that is the only thing that makes this film worth a look and i recommend it to any one who,to say more of the story was that i had no idea that he was trying to make an epic movie
1,at least it 's not for you but,at least the story is very good
1,logic is the key element of this film,logic is a bit of a stretch and for
1,just like the story in this film it is very difficult,just like the other reviewer i 've seen this film
1,this is a pretty awful movie that,this movie is just plain awful
1,however the film does n't work at all,however this is a very enjoyable movie
1,the film has an interesting message about the human psyche and how people do,the first thing that i saw was the opening scene of the movie
1,not only the most disturbing movie but a good film,not even a great film could make this film enjoyable or
1,i do n't think it was the point of,i have never seen such a bad film
1,if you have n't already been tempted and you are a fan of,if you want to watch this film it is a little slow
1,by the time the end credits rolled in the middle section of the picture i was left wondering why i bothered to watch,by the end of the movie you will get yourself on the floor of the story the story is a simple one
1,the movie is very well crafted and does a very good job of capturing the spirit of life as an integral element,the movie itself has a lot to say about it it 's a story about two people each and each other
1,i'm surprised that they made such a great movie out of it,i'm glad they did n't get more of a chance to develop the
1,this is the type of story which is a bit too short but it 's not too easy,this movie has no redeeming qualities to it and it does n't even have a good plot
1,as far as i would see it had to be done in a way it,as for the ending the movie is pretty dull and the acting is poor
1,the story is pretty good too,the film is also the first film
1,i have n't seen it since but it,i was really disappointed by this film
1,i have never been a fan of either of the other,i 've read the book the book by neil gaiman
1,meet the parents with a lot of,meet a girl who loves him
1,we have the two sisters with whom the movie is based and the fact that the film is n't even funny,we are told that she has been married to her son in a mental institution and is a suspect who does n't
1,this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made,this movie has a good cast but it 's a little
1,i saw this movie in my local video store,i 've been a huge fan of this series since
1,the story itself is not so much a film but,the acting ranges from the one to the other
1,since there is a lot of people around them there 's a lot of things going on,since i was not a huge fan of the first movie i had to admit i was n't
1,danika is a great actress in all her films,danika is a film with a very interesting and very
1,it has a lot of potential and,it was an accident to me
1,every time i see a film this is a very bad movie,every time he says it sounds like the movie is about a guy
1,if you 've seen this film you will probably have an extra view and a good time,if you like the genre and you want to enjoy something you 've been warned by this this
1,for some reason i thought i 'd give it a go on but it did n't,for instance the main character 's sister was killed and murdered by the police officer
1,twice in the world of the last mimzy is a wonderful piece of work that is worth owning,twice the same thing happens as he is being stalked by a woman who 's a bit different
1,it was an insult to the producers,it has a good plot line
1,they are not just a good movie,they are both the same two
1,she is a very good woman,she was a very talented actor but
1,by the end of the film there are two of them,by the time i was about to leave the cinema and the
1,that 's not saying it is the best movie ever,that 's because you have to see the first one of
1,if you 're looking for a great movie that can be enjoyed as an adult movie this is the movie for anyone,if you want a real movie and the fact that the characters do n't work for a movie is n't what they do
1,in the end he gets his girl back,in fact he 's a real trooper
1,but i do n't think that this is why the movie is so bad,but the film does not work as an accurate account of the story as it
1,i would n't even have been able,i was expecting a great show
1,i was expecting more than a few of the other reviews,i was really disappointed when the end of the film
1,this is a very good film to look forward to,this movie is just a bad bad bad bad bad film
1,of course it was in the film that,of course he does n't do much
1,i was n't really surprised at first to see it in the theaters,i would n't say that the film was made on a shoestring budget but
1,did n't anybody bother to tell me it was,did you ever see a film like this
1,is it supposed to be a comedy,is n't it a good thing
1,some of the acting in this movie was bad,some of the characters and actresses in the movie are
1,while the plot is not all that interesting it 's a very straightforward and compelling one,while i am not a big fan of the movie as a whole it was a pretty
1,this is the first and only movie of the year that i saw,this film is a complete disaster and i have never seen it
1,errol flynn has a small cameo as the man who is not the first one to,errol flynn 's performance is a bit stiff but he does deliver some fine lines
1,wonderful performances by all the actors especially the lead actress,wonderful acting by all involved and a great cast
1,i am sure i 've just watched it over and over again,i was surprised to find that there was no real plot at all
1,so if you have a problem with the,so the film is a complete bore
1,light hearted and funny and a perfect example,light is a very good film and it 's
1,but there is nothing to be said,but it 's also a pretty good movie
1,if you 're looking for a good film with a good message and great acting this may,if the movie has a great deal of action you can get a grip on it
1,jason lee is the only character in the movie that makes you feel like you 're in,jason robards has no trouble solving this and the film is not a comedy at all
1,norma is the daughter of a rich girl who is now a child of the mother,norma shearer and james stewart both play a pair of very likable men who have the right
1,the acting is horrible the plot makes absolutely no sense or the,the first is a good movie but the acting is horrible
1,firstly i thought it was an ok film but i would n't,firstly the film does not take the whole story too far
1,the script is not bad but that does n't mean that a movie should have been done,the plot is simple and is the only part of this film that is so good
1,helen mirren is a delight as the young girl,helen hunt was a bit of a surprise
1,the acting is n't as bad as the script but the directing is very,the script was so horrible that i did not even notice the characters
1,the acting is so bad that it is funny,the film has a very strong and very strong story
1,his character is not very likable at times,his character is the perfect guy for a movie
1,his wife and her daughter and the,his father is a good guy
1,the film is n't a very good,the movie is a little slow
1,the story of the film is a little confusing and a few scenes are not very good,the only reason i did n't was in this movie was because i had a headache
1,anyways i do n't care what happened to them,anyways it was the only time that he was able
1,yet there 's not really a lot of the original,yet the rest of the characters are so bad that it
1,they all do a great job with the material and the script is very very funny,they are just as bad and the only other person who 's seen the movie
1,forever this is not a movie i would recommend,forever it 's not even bad in a good way
1,also a lot of the scenes were filmed as a kind of homage to the,also the film 's plot is very simple and the ending is really bad
1,however i have to give credit where credit is due for,however the movie is n't really a good movie either
1,the plot is simple and there 's a,the acting is n't very good either
1,the plot is simple and the movie is not funny,the film was n't a bad movie it did not even
1,just as it was a lot of fun to say the least i liked the film,just a few things i did n't like in a film about a girl 's life or
1,1968 's first feature length of the night is a bit dated,1968 the story revolves around two men who get married to two friends
1,the acting was n't terrible but i felt that it was pretty bad,the plot is very interesting and the actors do a fine job of portraying
1,the movie is not as good as the first,the film is about two men trying to find love
1,she is not the only actor to be able to play the part,she is not a character who is constantly afraid of the fact that she
1,while the first two films were good this was the worst,while the film was obviously filmed in the late seventies the film
1,a film that makes you feel like you will be watching the movie,a lot of people have commented about that but this movie has it all
1,in fact the film is so much more enjoyable and,in fact i would love to see the sequel
1,he plays his character with his heart of gold which brings us to a more realistic,he is also in the background of the film and he has a wonderful voice
1,tombstone is a movie that should be enjoyed because it is,tombstone is a film that will not appeal to anyone
1,if you 've seen it you 'll probably find something new and unique to you,if you do like this movie then it is worth your time and money for it
1,it is not a movie to be avoided at all costs,it 's the kind of movie that you would watch over and
1,a movie that was released from an early 80 's and i have n't been to,a lot of things happen in the film are the same as the other films
1,basically it 's a pretty good movie for you to be a fan of,basically this movie does nothing but fill it with a bit of comedy
1,what i did like about this film was that it was a real,what i like about it is that it 's not so great
1,i have never heard of the original,i have n't seen the movie since the
1,there is a very good cast of characters and the,there is a lot of gore but no blood
1,besides this is another film with an interesting message of what is,besides the other characters that do n't have any redeeming features
1,the acting is good but the script is so boring,the movie starts in the end of the movie
1,cavite is one of the best of the series,cavite was the first one of the series of films
1,his mother played by michael vartan,his character is a stereotype and he
1,while there is a bit of a good idea the movie is a bit over the top but still fun,while the story is about a young boy who becomes a little more difficult to accept his life and his family
1,he is a very good actor but i really did n't know that this film was made to,he has to do a lot of talking to people and then he is just plain stupid
1,she 's got a few lines and it is a very good one,she 's the one who gets her hair stuck in the house and then
1,but the movie was n't as good,but i have to admit it
1,the film is set in the middle of a lake,the plot is about four young men trying desperately to get
1,you have to see that it is n't even funny,you 're in for one hell of a ride
1,claire danes is great in this role and she does not disappoint her acting skills,claire danes is excellent as a woman who has to cope with her own personal problems
1,robert duvall plays an excellent and very convincing role in his role,robert deniro plays an excellent role but it 's not that bad
1,i would like to see a lot of people and women,i do n't even know if you should n't have to have
1,christopher plummer is the only reason i gave this movie a 2,christopher plummer is great in his role as the bad guy and that
1,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and was so scared to read that it was,i have seen a couple of the bad ones that i have seen in a movie
1,if you 're looking for an interesting movie with plenty of action and a good story and some good actors this one was,if you 're a fan of the original film and are into the series you will be able to appreciate this film
1,do n't get me wrong i love horror movies,do not read it do not watch it
1,many of the characters are very well developed and the actors are all excellent,many people will have a hard time believing that the director has done a decent
1,all that said there are many things,all the other movies are great
1,acting is bad and the script was awful,acting varies a lot from the actors in the
1,it was a little hard to believe that he was in the movie and was trying to make some serious scenes,it 's a shame that the film was released in the uk for a week or so because it was made in
1,there are so many things i can say about this movie,there was also a good amount of action and action sequences which
1,a lot more people would know who the killer is because i think that he was a great director and a good actor,a very interesting story of the man who loves to be a man who has to be a woman to a child
1,noam was a good choice for a movie,noam 's character is an unlikable character
1,fuller 's the most popular film is the story that has the power to be the most,fuller is one of the finest actors in the world and he is great in it
1,lucas 's movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,lucas 's character is so stupid that i was wondering when was going to make a
1,110 the plot is a little farfetched,110 and i love the movie
1,i think i have seen it several times and it will never be again,i would n't go into detail on a film with this movie but i have
1,think it 's the best way to get a copy of the book,think that this was a very good movie that is just a good example
1,action sequences are so bad you can actually call it a horror movie,action sequences are a tad overdone but the film is very funny and keeps
1,i do n't know why i was watching this movie,i think the movie is a great film and the cast
1,and that 's why i did n't like this,and the acting in general is pretty good
1,if you 've seen this movie you will probably find yourself wondering why it was,if you do n't want to get a few laughs you 'll like this
1,his father was a little over the top when he,his character is the same as the old man
1,they are not so lucky to have a movie,they should be ashamed to accept the fact that this
1,in fact the story is so weak it makes it impossible to follow,in this one the characters are all very shallow and they are all very
1,a lot of the movie is shot in a,a very good movie with a great cast
1,the film was a bit too long,the plot is a little confusing
1,obviously it was n't a good movie,obviously a film of the sort would be
1,it 's just the worst thing ever written and acted,it 's not a good film to say it 's a
1,the movie does get a little bit boring,the film has a very good cast
1,screen legend is a fine film and it 's the first time in which the film is based on,screen adaptations of the first film were made for years with a great soundtrack and an amazing cast
1,the story is very interesting and the acting,the movie was a very good one
1,that was the only reason i gave up the,that 's what i got from this movie
1,the acting was n't great but it was n't really all that memorable,the film is very funny and very funny and it does a good job
1,many people have claimed that this is just a movie of the week and a waste of money,many movies have been shot and are made by the same old people in the same way
1,that 's not all that makes the movie bad,that said this is not the worst movie to come
1,do n't watch it because of the sheer stupidity,do n't expect a big surprise or two but a
1,it 's all about the characters the actors the characters the,it was a little over the top in my opinion
1,sonny is the most interesting character in the whole movie and it 's just the kind,sonny chiba has a very good cameo as always he looks like the perfect person
1,i have to say that i did n't think that was the only good scene in the story,i have been a fan of his work since he was in my opinion the best of all the
1,he had been in the military for a week and was now in jail with the police,he was n't a hero at all but the fact he was a little too old for a
1,i was n't surprised to see a movie that has such a good premise and i have to say this is one of the best i 've seen for a long time,i 've seen some really bad movies from this day and this one is so bad that i could go on to warn you that this is just the worst movie ever made
1,here we have one of the most boring characters ever committed to celluloid,here 's another one i 'll watch for the next 120 minutes
1,sure i know the movie has its faults but i ca n't say enough,sure it 's pretty funny and it has some good laughs but there 's a
1,there were many moments that were so ridiculous and ridiculous that it made me laugh at some parts,there were so many good movies out there that i was watching and i was very surprised
1,after seeing the first film i thought that the movie might be,after the first 15 minutes i was n't bored to tears
1,apparently it 's the story of the first movie which is supposed to,apparently it was a mistake to make a movie out of it
1,the script has the same effect on me,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,besides the fact that it 's an action,besides this is n't a bad movie
1,everyone involved in this movie has a bad taste for their,everyone else is just as good as the first one
1,the film was shot at the time and the fact that it was,the acting is horrible and the story line is not very good
1,despite all these things the movie is a very good one,despite that it 's a movie that has been told to be
1,for the first half of the movie the audience is treated to the main,for a few years i have never seen this movie in its entirety
1,i have n't seen this movie in years and i ca n't say it again but i think it 's a good movie,i was n't sure whether the director intended the money or not to be in that film and that 's the reason why i
1,lena 's mother and mother are in a relationship with the mother,lena is a great character but she does n't really seem to have
1,if you have never been a fan of hers you will love this film,if you do n't like the movie you 'll probably love this movie
1,however the story is n't bad and the,however the plot is n't too good
1,meanwhile it is a little too long and a bit too sentimental,meanwhile the police are sent by their father to help her and her
1,or maybe the best scene is when a woman is walking out of an asylum with a woman in a shower scene,or maybe it was because the actors had no talent but to make the story so interesting and believable and so much more
1,there 's a few good moments in this movie,there 's no plot line or even a hint of
1,this is the first movie i have seen in a long time,this movie is not a comedy and as you will probably guess it
1,i 've never seen anything like the original series and was very disappointed that i had,i saw the movie at the 2005 international film festival and enjoyed it very much
1,her acting skills and she is n't as convincing as,her acting is so horrible it hurts to watch
1,i have to say this is a great story,i was really surprised by what was happening
1,it 's a shame that a lot of people have,it is an interesting film that i have seen
1,the plot is about a couple,the only good things about this turkey
1,probably the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music,probably this film has been done on a limited budget
1,the plot revolves around a bunch of young men who are searching to be married and have a,the movie was a lot better than most bmovies and it was n't even the good parts
1,so i have to add some points of the movie that,so the story has a very interesting and intriguing feel
1,almost every character in the movie is very different from the one who 's the,almost every line in the film is a little choppy but it is n't
1,but i ca n't believe the people that made this movie like the movie should,but the best part of the movie was the way that it was shot
1,the story line is so bad that i actually laughed and cried at the movie,the only good aspect about the movie was the fact that it was shot entirely in
1,well the movie was a total waste of time and a waste of my,well this movie was not for the fainthearted it is an entertaining movie
1,but the plot is really a bit of a downer,but this is what makes the movie so enjoyable
1,however this time the characters are all so annoying and onedimensional that it could have been a little too easy for the ears to get the,however if you do n't want to watch this movie the first time you 're in a hurry to find something to enjoy about it
1,i think this one is the best movie ever created,i would n't say that if you have n't seen it
1,instead of being a complete mess of the genre,instead it is a story of two sisters who get
1,i 've seen many of the movies that are made in years and i can understand why some have said this film sucked,i do n't know why the people who did n't have to watch this movie are not going to be able to relate it
1,a few scenes with a little girl and an annoying,a great cast of fine performances and good actors
1,it 's not a very bad film,it 's also a shame because it was
1,more importantly the film 's story is,more than enough of the actors
1,good for what he 's done,good for the kids and girls
1,this movie is not about people who do so,this film has a few funny lines and some great
1,it 's like a tv sitcom,it 's like a cross between the
1,and that 's what the whole family does,and it is n't as funny as the other
1,that is the most stupid thing i have ever seen in my entire life,that is not what happened in the film the story of a girl 's mother
1,i think that this was a great movie,i am a fan of his show and this
1,absolutely the worst thing about a movie that was,absolutely the best movie i have ever seen
1,the plot is very thin and there are some interesting scenes but i,the film is not very good at first but is quite effective
1,another one of them is a very nice and interesting movie about two women who are married to the french mafia and are attracted by,another problem that is the story of a man who kills a man with an incurable cancer and is forced to fight for revenge
1,they 're just not as good as they are in the book,they should be proud of themselves for the sake of the script for
1,the movie is just a little too much on the action scenes which are pretty tame and the,the story of the movie is that there was n't a lot of people in the theatre
1,this is not a film that you will,this one is not a great one
1,i have seen a lot of movies but i,i think this should have been a movie
1,there 's a great deal of humor and there 's a few funny moments in the film,there is some interesting moments but not in the way of the story which is not the case
1,however there is no denying the difference between the two films which is the only way the same story is made to have,however i have a feeling of being the only one who has seen this movie and was able to get through it
1,that 's what you 're looking for,that 's all he has to work with
1,browning 's first feature length of filmmaking is also one of the best ever filmed,browning 's direction was n't as impressive as the other films but this one is so
1,at first the movie does n't have any sort of climax or atmosphere but the story,at times it 's a bit of a spoof but the plot is very good
1,its a movie you 'll enjoy,its a pity that the movie has
1,i think that this film was made in the early 80 's when the,i was surprised to find out that the film was a complete mess
1,a good movie is a must see,a lot of people who hate movies are
1,consider the movie was made in the 80 's and 60 's,consider the real problem with this film and that 's the problem
1,i was n't expecting too much and it was a bit slow for me,i think you can tell that the story was based on a true story which
1,it 's a pity that the movie,it was a waste of time
1,even though the movie was supposed to be a comedy it still was n't very good,even if it were n't for the poor actors the director and the writers would be able
1,not a good movie but not worth watching,not to mention that there were n't any more
1,for example the movie was made for a buck and the director should have,for some reason he was able to play a part in the movie
1,this is one of the most memorable movies i have seen,this is a movie that should be seen and forgotten
1,to sum it up this film is a complete,to say it is good is beyond me
1,but the fact that i do n't,but it is not that bad
1,but the film has no plot the acting and the direction is poor,but this is a movie that is not even worth a look
1,the film has a certain amount to it,the first time i saw it i was n't
1,let me say that i did n't,let 's start with the ending
1,i am sure the story line was not very well developed but the script,i am a big fan of john lennon and i liked the film
1,this is not a movie for kids because of all the things that are,this movie is so horrible and so unfunny that it is n't funny
1,first of all it is an insult to the intelligence,first of all i must admit that this movie was not
1,still i did n't see a film with such a bad cast,still the best thing about the movie was the fact that it was
1,olan is the one who 's got to be the killer,olan also has an obsession with the other woman but she does
1,the only reason to watch this film is because it has the best actors and actresses and,the script for this film is a bit thin and the characters are just too silly
1,between the two leads they have no chemistry whatsoever,between the first and second seasons the second is a
1,she was a great character and she is a great actress,she was also a good actress but she did n't have the
1,highly recommended to fans of the genre but,highly recommended for fans of asian movies
1,that 's what the film does offer in a way that is quite entertaining to a degree,that 's because i am not sure why this movie is rated r rating for the imdb votes
1,it would have been better if they had n't,it was a waste of time and money
1,i do n't know what the hell is wrong with the plot,i think the only good aspect of the entire movie is his acting
1,it 's the kind of film that makes the viewer think that it 's an indie film,it 's just that the film makes no attempt to explain the motivations or atmosphere of the original
1,the only thing i could think of was the movie,the first half and the second is the worst
1,spoiler warning spoiler alert the end result was just as awful as it,spoiler ahead i 've just finished watching this movie again and again
1,he is the only person that is able to get his hands on his own and his own,he 's a great actor and i really hope he does n't have a chance to do this movie
1,but i was so impressed with this movie i,but it 's a little bit too late
1,the only way to get a decent deal was that the movie was a good one,the acting and acting are pretty bad and the characters are n't even remotely believable
1,it is a shame that such an event is n't given enough money to produce,it 's not a bad film and there are worse parts of the film
1,he 's a pretty good actor but he 's too bland too,he was a great actor but i did n't see it
1,this one really should not be forgotten,this is a very very funny film with
1,it 's a great shame that the movie,it 's not even a good film
1,therefore a few moments were pretty much,therefore it 's not so obvious
1,there is no plot no real characters or no story,there are so many funny parts that i 'll take over
1,her character was just too much for me,her acting career is so bad that you feel
1,still i was a little skeptical at times,still i do not recommend this movie if you
1,who would n't want to make a movie,who cares if the film was made in the
1,halfway through the movie you get one of the best characters to come up in the last 5 years,halfway through this movie you 'll find yourself wondering what happens in the movie the main character is just a
1,although i have read many comments about how the movie is a bit dated the acting was pretty,although this is n't the first movie i can remember i think i 've seen it all
1,anyway i would n't have given it a lower rating,anyway i was a little surprised at how much i hated
1,the film opens with a bang in the coffin and a scene where the two protagonists have their,the first time i saw the film i was a little skeptical of the first two movies
1,newton plays the character with the right blend of charm and humor,newton has a lot more to do in the picture though the film
1,as for the movie it 's an okay thing but it has a good story and great acting,as i mentioned earlier that the movie has the same kind of feel that they did n't have in
1,one of the most underrated films i 've seen,one of the most enjoyable movies of all time
1,i think i would have given a better score as a film but there,i have never seen this show on tv but it is very funny
1,all of these scenes are the most important part of the whole movie,all this is happening with a few exceptions of course but it 's still
1,no one else has ever been so convincing but the script was awful,no real story no character development and even a bit of the dialog
1,i would say that i would n't want to watch the entire movie,i have n't seen the show yet so i do n't know what it
1,the story is n't that bad either,the acting in the movie is so good
1,in this film i have to admit that i am a fan of hers so i was disappointed in seeing this,in the end it 's not as much fun as the previous movie but it 's a little too long
1,this movie is not the best movie,this is not a bad film
1,throughout the movie there are a few moments in which the two are in danger and they are all together,throughout the movie you are reminded of the old west that 's not only about the only time it has the
1,personally i do n't think i have ever laughed so hard since this film is,personally i have to admit that i have n't seen much more than one
1,he was a very nice actor,he is also one of the finest
1,unlike the first movie i was n't expecting much,unlike a good film i 've read many of my
1,rather than the first film it would seem that the actors did not care about each other,rather than be overly sentimental and to the point of being a complete waste of celluloid and time
1,i think the movie is a bit slow at times but,i was very excited with the whole story and characters
1,i have to say that i was a little skeptical to watch this movie,i have to say though the acting is very good the story is a little
1,the story of the movie is so much better it makes the story more,the movie is a bit long in my life but in my opinion
1,and then there was some great acting talent that makes this film worth while,and the ending was so predictable that even a sequel could have been better
1,all the characters are all real and i love,all in all this movie is just awful
1,box office receipts were used to produce the original film,box office poison is a very good movie and has a
1,i think it has a good message but is not in the same ballpark,i do n't think this movie is meant to be an action film but its
1,if you want something to laugh at in your mind then watch this movie and,if you have n't seen this film you 're not likely to see this
1,with this film i thought it was going to be one,with a little more effort it might have been an interesting movie
1,aquaman is the most original film and it should be the same,aquaman is a film that you will watch for its entirety as it
1,jasmine was the first of the three but not the first,jasmine and the rest of the cast are the best actors ever
1,perhaps that 's just how the film works,perhaps that 's why they chose that it is
1,even the acting was bad and the special effects look cheap,even the usually excellent alfred molina as the conflicted man is a
1,teammate of the film 's cast and,teammate joe is a good guy
1,ace man was a good idea for a film with the usual,ace man was one of those films that was very bad
1,as for the movie it 's just a waste of time,as an example of his talent he should have gone back to
1,quite the film is not a complete disaster,quite frankly the film is a little slow at
1,the movie is a little long,the movie is a great piece of
1,i have to say that i did n't care for him but i really liked it,i think this movie is very much a rip off of the first two films of the
1,it is a film that has no heart and soul,it 's not all a good thing but it has a
1,the film 's only saving grace was the performance of the young lady as a boy,the script is a very simple one but the characters all feel as though they are just
1,spoiler ahead i 've been warned about the film but the film is so boring that i,spoiler ahead the movie is just a bunch of characters who are n't very convincing either
1,i saw the movie yesterday and i thought it was pretty funny,i was n't sure how much of a film the film was going
1,thus the whole film is so bad it,thus the movie is a total bore
1,spoilers ahead i 've been waiting for the next movie to come out of nowhere and i 've got,spoilers the ending of the film is a bit abrupt as well the plot is very confusing too
1,or the fact that the character was in love with one man who is n't the hero 's lover,or maybe the fact that the director is in his own right does n't even have a clear reason to
1,there is also a scene where the hero has a conversation with one of the men in a movie,there is an interesting and very interesting story of this woman who is married to a wealthy woman
1,i have a lot of problems with this movie as well,i was very disappointed and i had to go to a lot
1,i would recommend it as one of the most enjoyable movies in my entire family and i,i am a sucker for movies but this one is a waste of time and money
1,no one should know it 's a movie or a horror film and if the,no one can ever accuse me that he could be the greatest movie star
1,unfortunately this was a movie that should have been a major success,unfortunately there is n't a single moment that i would have given the
1,things like this are all so bad,things get really bad when he gets a
1,yeah the movie is a little over the top but it does n't work in the context,yeah the movie is a bit slow but it is very good and i liked it
1,not only do you get a movie that has been a,not that i would recommend this movie to the viewers
1,it 's all pretty much what the viewer would call a movie like the godfather and the lion king,it seems that a lot of people have been killed by the ghosts of a child and a girl named
1,this movie is one of the most overrated movies i have ever seen,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of time
1,like i said the whole plot line is a bit contrived and the story is so bad that they,like the other reviewer said this was probably one of the most memorable movies i 've ever seen
1,there was a lot of humor and some really,there 's no real character development at all
1,mark hamill is a good actor and,mark dacascos is great as always
1,as for the rest of this case i think it has,as for the story it 's a very good thriller
1,if they have the opportunity to show the audience the value of their own life this film will be much better,if you 've seen some of the recent tv series the series has a good plot and characters who are believable enough
1,this movie is a complete mess that,this is a very poor film
1,sadly the film is a mess,sadly this film has no redeeming qualities
1,as far as i know the story takes place in the same location as the original the movie and it has no atmosphere,as for the film itself it 's not a bad movie but it 's not as good as some of the later dtv movies
1,land of the ants is one of the most boring movies to ever,land and center are all very good and so are the characters
1,metaphor of what the bible was supposed to be,metaphor to the film for a long time
1,it is a shame that the filmmakers,it was like a home movie
1,for some reason i do n't know why,for the most part the movie is a very
1,i am sure that it will be a good idea but the film does n't make sense,i have n't seen it yet but i still do n't think it has ever been made
1,every character in this movie is so funny they all seem,every single line every word was delivered by the director
1,some people say it 's a little bit dated but it 's definitely the best film i,some of the scenes are just too long and boring too long for a horror movie
1,it 's the kind of movie that has a lot of action sequences,it 's not a bad movie but a few of those things that make
1,holmes does n't even know what he wants,holmes is an old man who was killed by
1,why is this movie ever made in the first place,why did the main character have to go to a building
1,think of a better story than this film and the acting is very bad,think about the fact that they have to be a part of the cast and
1,as i mentioned above i have never seen such a great movie,as a result i was a bit skeptical of this movie and i
1,thus the whole thing is just pointless and not worth the,thus the film is not a total disaster at all
1,the movie is a mess of the highest caliber,the film is not about a single mother who seems
1,china is an excellent place as the film opens,china is a beautiful young man who is a man
1,this is a very entertaining film and one that,this is a good movie and it shows
1,not so much to say that this has nothing to do with the film,not to mention the fact that this film is the only film that has any
1,crash of the abyss is a good movie,crash is a movie about the power of forgiveness
1,that 's why the movie is a mess and the ending is so stupid and predictable that it,that 's how it 's supposed to work for me and the movie 's only good points
1,ruining all of the other comments and reviews about the film the plot is a,ruining the movie you will not regret that this is a film for you
1,there was some really good special effects and great fight scenes for the first movie but this time the movie,there is a scene with the girl and the woman who was supposed to be married in a bar
1,first it was a very poor script and it,first of all the acting was pretty good
1,they have the decency to be able to get their hands on a new one and then they get a job to help them find that there is a chance,they should have been given a better choice to have a movie that they had a good story but could have used the same plot and the same actors
1,also it seems a bit of a stretch to,also the ending is very abrupt and predictable
1,someone who is the real person of this movie should have done the same thing with the same name,someone who is n't a big fan of the book should have been able to read some of the other
1,his mother who has a crush on him as the daughter 's father who is,his acting was so horrible i almost choked my nails out of the screen
1,hitchcock 's film is a masterpiece,hitchcock 's films are always a bit
1,her character has an innate attraction,her performance in the movie was very
1,the only thing i liked about this was the scene where she,the film is also a complete waste of time to watch
1,but if it were a bit more interesting to have a,but then it is n't as bad as the first
1,in this case the movie is just a mess,in my opinion this show is so bad that it
1,i saw the movie when i was a kid in college and we loved,i am not a huge fan of the movies i saw this film
1,i was n't a kid i did n't have to watch this,i was so shocked that they made it to this film
1,the movie is a very good one,the acting is n't bad at all but
1,it 's a shame they did n't get to play the part that was supposed to be,it 's a shame that a film like this could have been released in its entirety
1,instead of trying to make us laugh,instead he is a good guy
1,so the audience gets to the point that the viewer is left with something that 's actually just a bunch of random idiots that seem to have just,so many of these movies are so stupid they do n't even have the decency to be funny and i think they should have made it more
1,i do agree with the comments on this movie that it 's not even good enough,i was a bit shocked to find this a little odd in the first place
1,why not a film that is n't so much,why not just go for the ending to the story
1,but this is not a movie for people who like the,but the movie is n't so bad it 's good
1,although this film is an insult to the genre and a great film it is,although the acting of the characters is n't bad it 's not really bad
1,there are so many of us that that i,there are also some good points of dialogue
1,the film has a lot of plot and has a good cast and a lot of fun,the movie starts off slow but then the movie degenerates into one of the most boring films i
1,bender the movie was made by the critics who wrote the book and it was very good,bender is not a film about the evils of violence but a very good movie for the most
1,i do not remember seeing the original film in the theaters,i was expecting something like that in the first place and it
1,this is a good movie with great performances and some really good action,this is the first of three movies that i 've seen in my whole
1,action packed and very funny and it is a shame to have,action fans are a fan of horror film and action sequences
1,there are several moments of the film where the film has a very very very long shot,there was no way the plot could have ended and it was n't a great idea
1,a movie about a man who has a dream on the world,a lot of people are talking about the film and its a shame
1,now i can get my hands on something that is a great deal of fun in my opinion,now it 's all over the place and is just a little bit of an excuse for the movie
1,i saw the movie at the sundance international film festival in 1995,i 've watched it several times and still have to be one of
1,he is n't a great actress but he was just plain funny,he does n't get the job done but he has a few things
1,the film is also very funny and it 's very entertaining,the first time i saw it was when it was on my
1,it is a very good movie and should have gone to,it is a movie that is a joy to watch
1,when the young man is kidnapped and he is killed by a man he escapes from the clutches of a,when i first saw this film at the cinema the film was released on video in the late 1980s
1,it is the story of a girl who has,it is a very good and funny movie
1,kenneth branagh was also the most impressive character in history,kenneth branagh is also excellent as the villain and the movie
1,what is the deal with the rest of the movie,what was more shocking was that the film was shot with
1,or the real reason why it 's such an enjoyable movie,or the fact that the movie is set in england and it
1,despite all the hype this movie has got a good cast,despite a great cast and a good script it 's still a
1,it was a waste of time and money,it was not so much in the case of
1,today we 've seen this one before,today i am a bit of a fan
1,it 's not a bad movie just a few minutes later but it still gets,it is a pity that such a talented filmmaker has never given a role
1,the acting is horrible the directing is awful and even the acting is poor,the story is a bit confusing as the characters seem more like each other
1,certainly the worst film i have ever seen,certainly it could have been much better
1,the only thing good about this film is the way the movie,the film 's story line in this case is very interesting
1,i have been watching the film for years to come,i was very impressed to see a film that was made
1,somehow the film is n't as bad as a movie,somehow i would have liked to have this movie
1,really the story is a little farfetched,really it was a movie made by a
1,i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good movie,i 've just seen this movie on a friday afternoon and it is
1,first off i'm a huge fan of the book,first of all i do n't know how this movie
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen the film that has a detrimental impact,i would have liked to see it again if i have never seen the original
1,if they had had the money to do that then,if you have n't watched it please see it
1,this film was made on a shoestring budget but in my opinion is a very good movie,this movie was so stupid that it 's hard to watch it over and over again
1,as far as tv movies go i was very impressed to see a good film in the series but i was surprised by that i was surprised to find that this movie had nothing to offer,as for the rest of the cast it 's a little too much to be judged by the fact that the story was n't even original and the acting by the whole cast was pretty poor
1,these are the two most annoying movies i have ever seen,these two films have a lot of good actors and they have
1,wow if you are a fan of the first film or,wow i am going to be a little more forgiving
1,let me preface my comment on how this,let us make the film for you
1,if you 've seen it already and you have seen it on the scifi channel i suggest you do n't miss,if you 're not a big fan of any of the characters i would suggest this film to be appreciated
1,the film was so poorly made it was a waste,the acting is terrible and the writing is atrocious
1,respect me for a lot of the movie and i think it should be a lot more fun to watch a,respect me for the sake of being able to suspend your disbelief and do n't waste your time on it
1,the first time i saw this movie,the film is a total mess
1,most of the film takes place in a small town in which they have been taken with them,most of the time you ca n't help but smile at the screen as a person who just does
1,or at least it was a little bit more fun,or maybe it was because there were no big names in
1,the film is very funny and i have seen it many times,the acting is so bad i do n't know what the point of
1,the story line was very interesting and very interesting,the movie does boast a lot of nudity but that
1,but the film is very good,but it is still a very good
1,did anyone else notice that it would be a,did he have the power to do it
1,what i really liked this movie for,what was that all all about
1,where do you begin with that,where is the director who thinks that
1,a few years ago i had to watch this movie again,a few years after watching this film i could n't stop thinking
1,his performance is so bad it 's laughable,his character is a stereotype of a family member
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this movie does n't do a whole lot of good
1,it is an excellent film with great performances by streep and zellweger,it 's a pity that it was not released theatrically on dvd
1,well worth watching and i 'll keep you entertained to,well it was just a bit of a mess
1,some of the scenes were quite disturbing and some of the scenes in the movie are quite well done,some people do not want to be a little more intelligent and the story is so bad and the jokes
1,if you are a fan of the book i would recommend it,if you do n't believe me you will enjoy the movie
1,timothy spall plays the lead character in this film,timothy hutton is one of the finest actors of all
1,the only thing to say about this movie was that it was a waste,the film is a little slow moving but also in a humorous way
1,however there 's a very good story involving,however it is a good family film
1,but the rest of it is really just another lame,but i was very disappointed with the end result
1,i have to say that i was surprised that this was not a film that,i do n't even know what it was about the plot of the movie
1,at the start of the movie he is the one who is a loner,at first the film has a very bad plot but its a good idea
1,over the top this film is a bit of a disappointment because there really is n't a single redeeming feature of it,over the years i 've never watched it but the movie is just as bad as i 've remembered the acting
1,while it was n't as much of a joke that it was a little bit,while it is not a comedy it is a comedy which is a shame
1,if you like this sort of movie you 'll love this one,if you have n't seen a few movies that you have n't seen
1,i do n't know how it ended but what happened,i was expecting to be entertained but i found it very
1,he is not a bad guy and his acting was n't bad,he does not even try to get out of trouble or at least
1,the acting is pretty good for the time but the film is pretty poor,the only redeeming qualities of the movie was the ending which was a complete copout
1,it 's a shame that the film has no real redeeming features,it was a nice surprise to get back to this film and i
1,wow this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,wow you do n't want to be a good horror flick
1,it seems a lot of things are missing the point that,it 's like watching a film in a cheap way
1,in the end the film is a total dud,in fact i think the director should know how to
1,mr blandings 's character was so annoying that we could n't even,mr and mrs the woman who was married for the crimes
1,everything about it is a joke,everything that i can remember was a
1,with a cast of unknowns it is a pity that the script was n't,with that said the film is a little too long to be funny
1,sanjay mcdowall is a revelation as the,sanjay dutt 's performance is perfect
1,this was not a good film,this movie is a real treat
1,i have not yet read the books,i would say that this was the first
1,the plot twists have more holes than swiss cheese the first one,the story is n't bad the acting is worse and the writing is
1,there 's a lot of sex and violence in it,there is a scene of some of them walking around and
1,another example of how a director should be given the opportunity to see the movie again to see how a director could have achieved the same story and the same,another reason to watch a comedy is that you have the feeling of having a little kid who has been in trouble with the other girl from the beginning
1,it seems a little too convenient for the first half and the film does n't even get as much attention,it 's also not very funny but it 's a nice little comedy which does not make you laugh
1,le boucher is a wonderful movie that has some good actors but the story,le cercle rouge is a very good film but it fails to deliver
1,at the same time a man is a woman who 's been raised in the past of the world and the man who is being transported by her father is killed,at times it is a bit too long for me to realize that it 's not as good as that of the others but i have n't yet watched that
1,barmak was a master of the art of filmmaking and art,barmak was not the least bit of a master in this film
1,with the exception of a few of the actors in the movie they are not bad,with the exception of the great music the movie is n't a very nice one at all
1,but this is not the case with the movie,but the film itself is not the worst of the
1,sure the movie was a complete failure,sure there are parts where the film is
1,and the film is a very good,and it 's a great shame
1,here 's a real stinker for me this movie is so bad it,here she is a young man who is a very human person
1,but the real thing in this film is a story that does n't make sense and is about how it 's,but the film is not as good as the first one but the movie is a little slow at times
1,that was a great movie that had a,that 's not the only redeeming qualities
1,then there is the scene where he goes into a coma to retrieve a car,then again the film was n't so bad and i was bored at all the horrible
1,an example of what was wrong with the movie,an american werewolf movie is not only that good but
1,john ritter is excellent as the villain in this film,john huston was great as always and his performance is great
1,i think you should see this movie,i am amazed that it has received such
1,come in and you will get the feeling that you 'll just be able,come on you can find yourself in a way to watch this movie
1,watanabe was n't as good as some of you and you 'll see his work,watanabe 's film is a very well written film of a man 's life and his
1,perhaps the only reason i can see for the film was because i saw the movie as an example of,perhaps it was a good idea to make a film that does n't make a profit to the story
1,however the only reason i watched it was to see,however i was a bit disappointed in the end
1,i do not want to give anything away but the plot line and the performances are all excellent the,i am not a fan of the genre but i 've always been a huge fan of hers
1,from the moment the movie starts you 'll find yourself rooting for the characters and sympathize to each other in,from a very good start i found the whole thing to be a complete waste of time and money
1,and what is it with most people with a sense of humor,and then there is the fact that the story of a young woman
1,is the movie supposed to be a comedy,is it the best of all things in the
1,i have to admit that i am a fan of the series and the film,i was surprised that it was n't nominated for best picture but it was not
1,how the hell could this movie be so awful,how can you go wrong and have the courage to
1,some of the scenes are just ridiculous but it 's a great movie for,some of the jokes are funny but the film itself is pretty lame
1,the plot is simple enough but the script is a mess,the acting was so bad the characters seemed like a bunch of
1,you know you 're in trouble when the movie is n't funny anymore but it 's not that bad and,you can get the feeling that the director was trying something new but it 's just a boring movie
1,again it 's the most boring of the whole film,again he gets the girl to go out of town to
1,however it is also the best of the three,however the acting was n't all that bad and the
1,that was the most stupid and stupid part of the film,that 's what i call a movie that is not a movie
1,nowhere as a whole i was impressed with the fact that the,nowhere that i would have given up on the first episode
1,since it has been released by the director of the original film this is a movie that has,since there is no story to the film its the characters that are so real and real
1,you can see that there will be more about the characters and the situations,you can see that a film made about a hundred years from a different angle
1,she 's the one who is n't the girl that killed her,she does n't get a chance to see him in a film that
1,jason statham was the best thing about it and he was really good in it,jason lee 's character was so stupid it was impossible to identify with him
1,it is n't even that the story is a complete failure,it is n't really that good or anything it 's good to
1,i was expecting a great movie but i could n't believe how,i do n't want to give away any of the plot
1,there are some funny moments though and the characters are so stupid that it makes you angry,there was a scene in which we were talking about the film and the scene where the hero
1,you will probably enjoy this one as well as the ones that are the first two,you have to take the camera in a way or two to the camera work
1,what a horrible film this is,what i got is a story that
1,may contain spoilers the movie was a little slow,may be that it was made at least for the
1,i would recommend it to people who,i have n't read the book
1,watch the scene where the hero is forced,watch out for any other horror movie
1,and it 's also the same old movie from that same old same school,and the film 's main character is a bit too old but he 's really
1,low budget b western stars and a pretty low budget but that 's what makes a film good,low budget movie that looks like a bad student 's movie with a lot of money and lots and
1,the acting is n't as good as the first one but it is n't bad,the only real flaw in the story is the casting of a bunch of characters who
1,i have n't been in a coma for ages,i do n't know if i can get a good
1,a very bad movie that i have not seen since it is a sequel,a few people who are so obsessed with the original story will find it hard
1,d'amato 's movie is the only film i ever saw,d'amato and his crew of characters are all very good and
1,this is one of the better movies on a,this is the worst of the worst movies
1,the first time i saw this movie i did n't know whether or not the film was a comedy or a,the acting was horrible the script was so bad i was bored by the film and the acting was atrocious
1,this movie is a masterpiece in which the characters are introduced to the camera and the characters are all,this was probably the most popular and funniest film i have seen since manos the hands of fate
1,and it 's just too bad that it would have been more,and there are several scenes that are n't even worth seeing
1,the film is not so bad as the other two and the only thing that is worth noting in this film is the scene with the mother and a,the movie is a great mix of both genres and the most beautiful movie about an aging man on the brink of the madness and the love story
1,this is a great movie for kids,this is one of the worst shows i
1,it 's a good story but not very good,it 's a very good film that is not only
1,when it first aired i was in for a great surprise i had to watch this,when i heard of it and the movie itself was so funny i had n't been able
1,i was very surprised at the end when he was,i was n't really expecting any of his films
1,not to mention that the movie has no meaning,not even that one can save you from watching the
1,he is also a good actor but,he 's not even remotely funny
1,one of the best movies of the last 50 years,one of her most famous movies in which the main character
1,we 're supposed to sympathize with the characters,we do not get it on a second viewing
1,about the only thing i did not like,about this movie is a good film
1,sam neill 's character is so good it is a shame that the show was made,sam peckinpah has created a film that does n't have to be seen and it is a
1,further the movie is a very good one but it 's not as bad as the,further it is a film that has to be seen to be believed by all
1,i have been waiting for this movie to finally come across a movie with so bad,i would n't have been so offended if they had been shot on a train station and
1,check out the film and see how the director and writer were making this one,check out the film if you can get it and you 'll never see a movie
1,his acting and the script is great but the script is very bad,his acting is a bit stiff but the story is very solid and the
1,not only is it an attempt to make a statement about a movie that fails miserably,not to mention there is a very long line to the film in one of the most
1,while the movie was n't as bad a movie as this movie it certainly does n't have any of its charm,while the film may have been an enjoyable experience of a good story it was just a bit too predictable
1,terry and june are all together and are not afraid to make a living,terry gilliam does a very funny cameo in this movie as the lead character
1,it is one of those movies where i have a headache at me,it 's a shame that this has n't made much of a cult following
1,it is the most interesting film i 've ever seen,it 's a very sad movie and a good idea and
1,daniel and his buddies were a bit more annoying,daniel auteuil as the head of the group is a
1,i am sure it was a movie about a woman who had a good life and was in a way toward him,i would give this show a 9 but the only thing i do not give it was that it was a total flop
1,the movie has its flaws but the acting is n't as good as i would have,the only thing to be said is to say this film is a little overrated
1,in fact it is so obvious that it 's difficult to make a movie about it,in fact i do n't have any complaints that the director has a vision of his own
1,let 's get a few lines that i think it 's fair to say,let 's face it the story is about a young man named cesar and his
1,the only thing missing was the story of how she went and how she became her friends,the film is a very good film and the film follows a very interesting topic of racism
1,well the first thing i remember was that,well i 've seen some bad films
1,usually i would n't have had a clue about this,usually i think that the film is very good
1,for those who want to see a film i 'd watch,for some reason the writer did not even have to make it
1,given the choice of the actors in it they are not very likable or even a,given the subject matter in this film the characters do n't have much in common
1,is this movie about the same kind of person as,is it a matter of time to come back
1,it has no logic and it 's not,it 's a great movie to watch
1,carradine is a good actor who is always a very bad actor but his performance here is very poor and he makes the film seem to,carradine was the most popular actor in my life but the movie did not even have the feel that a lot of other actors had
1,my favorite was that i could n't see the ending,my advice to all this is a good one
1,my favorite part is when the girls and the girl are chasing the girl and then,my favorite character was the one who was the father of the mother and son
1,but then you get a lot of the movie,but the film 's main focus in a film is
1,he is a man of sorts who is n't even aware of the existence of a man who can only get his,he is the only character who has ever played the role of an alcoholic or in any other form of comedy
1,now it 's a bit of a mess and a little too long,now that i 've seen the first one i think i 'd like this
1,funny and interesting in its own right,funny and poignant the film is n't even
1,i have been waiting for a good movie to have,i was n't even born to watch this movie
1,the movie itself is about a group of men who,the acting is terrible and the script is awful
1,user has to say that i have a feeling that a film of this kind would have been made to a better career,user is n't the type of movie that should have been so good for a laugh but in a very short time
1,all in all a very entertaining movie but,all in all a very good film
1,nothing happens to you in the end but you do n't,nothing new or exciting in this film and nothing more
1,when i saw her in the credits i was n't expecting much from it,when the movie is over you will find yourself laughing hysterically and you 'll be
1,that said i think the director did,that is what this movie is
1,then there 's a couple of things wrong with this film,then we have the token and stupid character who is the main
1,it 's the story that makes the movie a little bit of a thriller but it is definitely worth watching,it 's a pity that the film 's failure to be able to get the recognition of the production company
1,this movie is so bad i ca n't believe,this movie is so bad it 's good
1,george lucas 's direction is quite good and the music was great,george sanders does a good job in the role and does a great
1,overall it 's a good movie and i hope to see more from him,overall the film does have some good moments but the film is n't really a
1,anyway if you want to see an actual movie about a killer snowman then this movie was a,anyway i am not a huge fan of movies like myself this is a very funny movie
1,but i was n't surprised to see how much it was made for a movie i had no expectations,but that was the only reason that i watched this movie because i could have done it better
1,so much for you and your kids,so i am going to go to the
1,the film 's story is told in flashback sequences and is a great example of what a movie can,the story is so ridiculous and so contrived that it could not make it a priority to preach
1,howl is the kind of film where all the actors are involved,howl is the only thing that has ever been done before
1,he plays a man who is a very rich and humble person,he is a little more realistic and his character is so much more
1,well worth a look for all the actors who can act,well i did n't get it i did but it 's very
1,there 's a lot to enjoy here,there 's not even a single character in
1,although i 've heard some of them in the past i was looking forward to seeing this movie,although i think they should make the film a bit better there are some scenes with little dialogue which
1,maybe it 's the director and writer of the movie and i 've,maybe the director is n't trying to make a point about it
1,but the film also shows what a great director this is for,but if you like the original you should see this one
1,it 's also an enjoyable film that has some great acting by the stars,it 's a movie with a great soundtrack that makes it worth watching
1,fred astaire plays a character of a man in a suit who is trying to make the most of her,fred williamson was a great actor and i have n't seen him do a very bad job of acting
1,it 's like an animal movie but it does n't,it 's not the most important film of the last couple
1,should we not see the movie for the,should we not have seen them all
1,anyway the plot is n't a bit of a comedy,anyway it is a good idea for a film to be
1,there are a few good things here,there were no more plot holes
1,the movie is a little bit of fun but there is a little bit of,the film is a little dated but the story does have some good moments
1,easy to understand this is not a good movie by any means,easy to believe it was made by the director of the movie the
1,brought together a very good story,brought to you the movie and then
1,i was n't really sure if i was watching a movie or a thriller,i was hoping that it would get better and that was the reason
1,they are the kind of people that should never be allowed to act,they are not in the movie and the actors are all very bad
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie was a very good one
1,regardless of the lack of talent in the cast this film has the ability and weaknesses of the original movie,regardless of the fact that it has a few moments it 's a little too long and it 's just too
1,finally i saw the trailer on the dvd at the local rental shop where it was released,finally a lot of people do n't care if it 's supposed to be a comedy or drama
1,how could the producer of the film be,how could this be a great movie
1,i 've read the novel and was surprised to learn that it was a film about people who could,i was so disappointed that i found myself asking myself that it would have been a good film
1,this film has a very good story line and the,this is a great film with a wonderful cast
1,myrna loy 's role as the ballerina was so good as to be a little too much,myrna loy is a delight to watch but she does n't seem very believable in this one
1,i am a diehard fan of david cronenberg films and,i think the movie is just a good idea
1,unaware that he was trying to get back to the old west he was a little bit more than a year later,unaware of the fact that a movie like this can never happen and it will make the viewer believe that it 's not
1,then you 're watching a bunch of kids dressed,then the film settles in a little more
1,i have seen the movie multiple times and i do,i do n't know whether to laugh or cry
1,while it is the only time i can think of that as a film i would n't be disappointed if it 's not that bad,while the film is not as good as other movies of the same ilk it is still a really good film with excellent performances from all
1,ben affleck has an excellent turn as,ben affleck is an absolute hoot
1,in the end i thought this was a good movie,in this case it is not a good film
1,and the ending is so ridiculous,and the movie has no sense to
1,predictable to watch this movie was made for the sole purpose of watching a movie that was not even close to being a masterpiece,predictable and contrived and i mean there 's no way that i could have done it again but it 's just so bad that you
1,sure there was a lot of sex in the film but i guess the movie had a lot of potential to be funny,sure he 's the best actor in the movie but he plays his role very well and plays a very believable part of the
1,she is n't a bad movie she 's not just a bad actress,she is a very good actress but she 's too much for her
1,it 's a very funny movie,it seems a bit rushed for him
1,will we ever get back in the future,will smith plays the role of the young man
1,this movie has been done so poorly that we get,this one does n't really deserve to be seen
1,i am a huge fan of horror films,i would n't say that this is an excellent
1,i am glad i did n't watch the movie,i 've watched this movie several times and still enjoy
1,he 's also the first of a lot of problems,he 's not a bad guy at the end
1,the story of this movie is very simple and very funny and i think that the director has been,the movie has a good pace but it does n't seem to be that well it 's not
1,some of the acting is terrible and the acting is just bad,some are not as much to go and say the story is n't
1,so it is a little bit to say,so why did he keep the movie
1,a movie like this should have been put down in this context,a movie with a few laughs and a few laughs at it
1,however it 's the best of its kind and is one,however it does not really matter to a certain degree
1,well i think you should see it if you have n't,well this is what you 'd call a bad movie
1,all in all i would like to thank,all in all not a bad movie
1,and the film has a lot of fun in,and the movie itself was pretty funny too
1,spoilers this was a pretty decent movie but i really enjoyed it so much that i could n't believe,spoilers ahead i was a kid with the movie and the other characters were n't even remotely funny
1,it 's not a very funny movie at all but still a fun one to watch,it was a bit of a surprise to see the movie in a way that the movie
1,that makes you feel like you 're,that is a lot of things
1,every time i see it i will always be my friend,every single person who was born with me was a real fan
1,dialogue wise but this is n't one of my least favorite movies,dialogue is a lot more subtle than most of the other movies of
1,also the movie was shot in a,also the film was very good
1,and the whole thing was so boring and stupid it was funny to watch,and i was surprised to find the whole thing to be a very good thing
1,its like it was made in a very,its a movie with all the actors
1,the script is full of holes and the script is a little too,the plot is n't too bad as it is a little thin
1,she is not a good actress,she was n't in the original
1,the first film was great and the acting,the story is simple but very interesting
1,now i know that this movie has some appeal but i have never really heard of it,now we have a film that has to be the most popular of the lot but the most
1,also the music is a perfect fit of music,also the film was a complete waste of time and
1,during the movie the only good thing is this movie,during this film i was n't expecting any more
1,given that the film was based for a real good idea and was not a good,given the chance i 'd have to be able to see this in a theater
1,this is a movie about a man who is a loner of a man who,this film is so awful that it 's almost impossible to make an embarrassment
1,i have never seen a worse film in my,i do n't know what it is about
1,earlier in the movie there is a little bit of the movie,earlier the story of three starcrossed brothers who go to a remote island
1,this is one of the few films that you will,this movie does n't make much sense at all
1,if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy this movie,if it was not for the fact that i was expecting a more
1,gable and his partners are not as funny as some of these,gable and dunne are very convincing and it is a shame
1,the plot is a bit weak but hey there are a few things,the only thing this film has going for it is the cast
1,urich 's character is so stupid,urich was n't so much a character
1,i have a feeling that it is not that bad,i have n't even been able to locate the original
1,the film was a little too slow but the story of,the movie is a little slow but that 's it
1,it 's a very sad film that should be shown to,it has a very good plot and a great cast
1,daniel daylewis plays the main character in the movie,daniel daylewis is also excellent in the role but i
1,each chapter has its own distinctive characters,each episode has a great storyline and an
1,both men do n't look as if they have been in a very similar relationship in,both the film 's detractors and the critics are all very interested in this film
1,now the movie is a good movie,now i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i do n't know how it would get any better,i saw this film when this movie premiered and i must
1,something like this was a huge mistake,something that is n't even worth the time
1,i do n't know if this movie will go on for hours but that is n't the reason that it 's so good,i have n't heard that 's all i can say about this film it has some flaws but is so bad that i ca
1,everyone involved in this movie is not a,everyone is entitled to say the least
1,i think the problem with this film is that it is so dull and so badly acted that it 's,i was really shocked that it got canceled after seeing it i can only say i have no idea
1,interesting characters in the story are the ones who have the power of the characters who are in love with,interesting but i was n't impressed with the film as it did n't have to be a horror film
1,all these years later he gets killed by a zombie,all in all this movie is a perfect movie to see
1,it 's a very bad movie that i would like to see again,it 's like a bad tv show with a lot of people trying desperately
1,not to mention that there was a scene in the movie,not so much of a plot as you can imagine
1,the acting was ok i did n't think,the story is not very complicated either
1,harris' mother has to deal with the loss of a new love and she goes on,harris' character has a very thick and loving personality that makes his life more sympathetic
1,i have seen it many many times before and since i love a good laugh but this is not one of those movies,i think i 've been a bit harsh since i was in my youth i have a soft spot for this film
1,but the real life and this one is n't as bad,but this is not a movie that is n't funny
1,two years later the girl 's daughter is kidnapped by the mother of a young,two things about this movie are the music and the music and the music
1,the plot is about four men who go to a house in the,the story is a bit slow and the acting is pretty good
1,as for the acting this movie is n't really a bad one either,as far as i am concerned i have seen the original film and the
1,when i watched it i thought it was funny,when i say the movie is bad i mean it
1,movies that are supposed to be funny but are,movies are not bad but they are bad
1,as for the rest of the cast i thought the script was very good,as for the rest it 's a good little movie that i do n't recommend
1,she has the most annoying accent of her life and the fact that she is a,she also meets in the film with the two boys and then she is killed
1,the acting is superb the characters are believable and the story is told through flashbacks,the plot is n't that great and the acting is n't really bad either
1,the film is also filled with flashbacks that are not really funny,the film is a very interesting and touching thriller about a group of
1,a lot of the time i have n't seen the film and if that 's what i would want to be,a few of the scenes were filmed during the day period and there was a brief scene of the young boy walking
1,add to that many things that do n't make sense but there are some good parts,add to that the fact that the actors and actresses make a movie they 're really really
1,chris benoit is a good actor as well,chris farley was a good actor but i do
1,hope lange is in the film and she has a chance,hope that you get a chance to see it again
1,times square and a lot of the same,times of all the actors are great
1,strong and powerful characters with likable personalities,strong and interesting but it was just too
1,wow i think it 's a good movie,wow i ca n't say i was impressed with
1,after seeing this film it is difficult to understand why this is not considered as a classic,after watching this movie i had no idea who this was and who the real people were
1,these characters are not caricatures or personalities of characters,these are the things i love about this flick and
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd,it 's not a good movie to me that this is the best way
1,i am sure this film could have been a decent movie,i was a bit confused that the film would be as good
1,grey city was a great film about a young woman who has a daughter who was a little more than just a normal woman,grey owl is a very funny film about the struggle between the brothers and the parents of a group of friends and how they live
1,as with most movies that have never been released in the,as a result the movie is a bit too slow
1,i have to say that i was so disappointed when i saw it,i have seen many other movies that have been made and have to be
1,letting the story speak and the characters develop the plot and story,letting it be said to be a bit of a spoiler
1,however there is a bit of a good reason for this film to work,however this is a great example of a film which makes you question the meaning
1,some of the acting is ok,some of them were n't even funny
1,why did i even bother to watch it,why does the main protagonist get to be a
1,yeah so i have n't seen any of these movies,yeah this is an old fashioned and interesting movie
1,naturally the movie is a bit too,naturally they are not even funny
1,the film is very well directed by joseph andrews,the only reason i gave it a 3 was because
1,there 's some really good fight scenes and plenty of cool stunts but they just do,there are a few moments that are really great but the acting is so bad
1,what makes it so great is the acting,what is the deal with the girl
1,i saw this movie in the late sixties and it was a waste of my time,i 've seen the first few movies and i was very disappointed by the movie
1,plus it was not a comedy,plus i do not want to spoil
1,thus the movie is a bit slow moving and not very good,thus the story was very very very predictable and the movie just left
1,i saw this movie at a film festival and i have to say its one of the best,i have to say that i have been in a very good mood to watch a movie
1,it 's a great piece of entertainment,it 's the best of the series
1,molly ringwald as the mother of a rich girl is a bit too young to play and the film is,molly ringwald plays the part of a mother who has to deal with a traumatic relationship between his parents
1,mugs to the camera as if the director had done the movie for some reason it,mugs of the actors the actors are all fine and they 're all very believable
1,the story of two sisters who are sent to investigate the,the plot is very interesting but not the best thing
1,a good idea of a film is the acting,a film about a young woman who is a young
1,the first half of the film is a complete ripoff of,the acting was so bad it was funny to watch
1,george clooney is a good actor but he does have a few good things to say about,george brent is great too and he 's a great actor but his acting is horrible
1,it 's a good family movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys watching the likes of the first movie,it seems that a lot of people have been conditioned to do so but this has no real connection to the book
1,the plot is a simple one with a group,the film is a complete waste of time
1,as the movie progressed the ending became a little abrupt as was,as i said in my comment this was an excellent film
1,beside that it is a movie that should be seen by all,beside the first of the three thirds of the series i felt that
1,this movie has a very good story and the story was very interesting,this movie was one of the worst of the year 's movies of the
1,a very interesting story but not enough to save the story,a film about an aging and resilient man who is not a
1,i'm sure there is an explanation for all of these people who have been,i'm sure that this film is just the right thing to do n't
1,give it a chance because it is n't that bad,give me the impression that it does n't take itself too
1,and i do not know what it was like,and then you see the end of it
1,he is a little nervous but he never really seems to have been able to pull it off,he is the kind of man that has no qualms of the situation that are made in the first
1,ordinarily it was very difficult to find a movie that did n't have the decency or,ordinarily i did n't see that any film in this movie was anything but good
1,of course they are n't all that attractive and it,of course the film is a bit too short
1,jason statham stars in this film and he 's a pretty good actor,jason schwartzman plays his character in the first movie and the film is n't
1,also in this movie are the characters,also there is some great acting talent and
1,i would like to see more movies that have,i was n't impressed by any of them
1,without the benefit of the doubt this is one thing that i would,without the sex scenes in the movie the acting is pretty poor
1,i would n't have had to have made my own conclusions,i have n't laughed so hard since that was the only film
1,if you 're not a fan of the original you may want to check this one out,if you 're looking for the worst film i 've ever seen this was the one to watch
1,during the film there were a few laughs,during the first season we see a bunch of
1,i am not a fan of the show but this is a very good show,i was n't sure who it would really be as the movie is a little bit
1,i have been looking for a film that will not be missed,i do n't know if it has to be done by a group
1,until i was able to obtain the film i was a big believer,until then the movie is about as exciting as watching paint dry
1,the film is a little long for the plot,the acting and writing were good enough but the acting
1,also i was impressed at the end where she was trying to get the girl out of her head,also the story was not bad the characters were very believable and it seemed like they had to work for
1,he is a little too preoccupied with the story,he also has a lot more time than he could
1,his wife in the film does an ok job,his father is a very young man who wants to
1,it is a good movie but the acting by all of the characters is very poor and the movie is a bit boring at times,it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't make the same movie twice as it did n't seem that the film was released on dvd
1,in the beginning we see how the people of denmark,in fact it was so good for a laugh
1,well it 's also a good thing,well i do think that this film was
1,now i can see how it 's a,now this film was shot on tv
1,the first thing you notice about it is that the characters in the show are just,the first thing that was wrong with this movie is that there is no suspense
1,it has all the elements of a good film and a good one,it 's like he 's trying to make a movie that is a little
1,since the movie was a little too long for the director it was made in the early 90 's,since i was a little too old to play it in my head i still think that this movie is
1,it is a good story that should never have been made but the story itself,it 's just a shame because this is what makes the movie so unique
1,a great movie for a rainy night,a movie about the holocaust that is a
1,bimbo plays a young woman whose husband is killed by her husband 's daughter and her son,bimbo is the one who gets her kit in the end but it turns out she 's been
1,as for the acting it 's really good,as the series progresses from the first film the
1,totally different from the usual suspects that have been in the us in the first place,totally unbelievable for the most part i found this movie to be a complete disaster
1,the acting was n't too bad but the plot was a little too predictable,the acting is so terrible that the film is a complete waste of time
1,and the scene where he is supposed to be the main,and it is the only real drawback of this movie
1,and the movie is about the family and how their family is in love with each other in an attempt to get the,and the scene where she has the most beautiful scene in the whole movie and i have n't seen the first one
1,maybe the reason i gave it a rating of 4,maybe the director is going for a good movie
1,not to mention the lack of any kind of character development that is needed,not only is this film a very good film but i think that it 's
1,i would love to see a more mature movie,i have seen all the other films from the same
1,however there is no reason to watch this unless you do not have an inkling,however i would have to say this movie is a total waste of time
1,death wish 2 is a movie with no surprises and the,death bed is a film that i will never forget
1,it 's a shame that this movie has been released for,it does n't matter what the movie was all about
1,spoilers spoilers below the ending was the same as the first part,spoilers ahead this film is about a woman 's life and the world
1,nicely photographed by cinematographer john mctiernan and his cinematographer michael,nicely written acted and well written by the director
1,if you 're not familiar with the original and are a bit biased and have the,if you are a fan of the series watch it if you have n't yet
1,yes this movie was not good but it 's just not the,yes the acting is bad but the plot is pretty bad
1,though i 've never seen such a good movie on the shelf i ca n't stand this anymore,though it did have some flaws the acting was ok and the actors were n't too bad
1,wood 's performance is a bit too stiff for the role but the story is not,wood is a fine actor but the film does n't have that much screen time
1,have the filmmakers and screenwriters of this,have you ever seen the film
1,she 's so funny that she makes it difficult to get a glimpse into a character,she was a real actress but i do n't want to be too wrapped up in her
1,he was the most likable of the three characters but he is not the only actor to be,he also has the ability to use the old tricks of the same location which are used
1,dante is one of my all time,dante is a master of art
1,when the first episode of the original series was aired in new zealand,when i watched it i thought it would be a good one
1,if you do not have a clue about it you will see why,if they were to make a good movie about an ordinary person i would
1,given what i think of this film is the best way i can find this,given a few of the cast members i 've seen this show and have a few
1,unfortunately the script does n't seem to know what to do with the script and the script is n't as,unfortunately i was n't impressed with the ending and found myself wishing it would improve as the movie did
1,and the ending was really awful to me,and the movie has a few twists
1,i have n't read the book but it is a very good movie,i was surprised that the story of the film is so predictable
1,it 's not a bad thing that the film could get any worse,it is the kind of movie where all of the characters were stereotyped and
1,this is one of those movies that i wish i could watch and never forget but if you are looking for a,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i 've been watching it over a long time
1,screamers is a film of the highest importance it has to offer,screamers has no redeeming qualities but its just a fun and enjoyable ride
1,i think it 's one of the best films i,i was a bit reluctant to see this film
1,they should have made it a little more fun but instead they are left with a lot more questions that are,they do have the right to make the movie that the director and the director have chosen for the plot
1,little does he get the girl from a different situation but his dad is not really a bad guy,little of the acting of the film 's plot is a little uneven but the performances are very good and
1,it was a very nice movie,it has to be one of my
1,when i first saw this i was a little bit scared and disappointed by the movie,when the film is finished it is not even worth mentioning that you are not in for
1,by the time he arrives he begins to suspect that he is in love with a very mature person and has his,by the end of the movie i was just hoping that someone would have to be in for a real surprise
1,i have never seen a movie infuriated by the utter lack of imagination that made it such a classic movie,i do believe that the director of this movie was the most talented of the bunch to make this one
1,he is a great actor who is also,he 's just a bit too long
1,i was hoping to see something better but this was n't,i 've never been a big fan of the comics
1,except for a few things that made me laugh out loud,except for the fact the film 's plot has been written for
1,when they arrive and the two of them are talking they get the whole family,when i first viewed this movie i thought the movie was going to be a bit
1,this one is not for everyone,this is a very very good movie
1,she 's not even a great actress,she 's a woman in the film as
1,what 's with the other characters,what is this supposed to be a
1,it would be a shame to see a remake of this movie on a,it was n't that bad just for the sake of a bad movie
1,if you have n't seen this movie i recommend you,if i were to make it through i would choose to
1,gripes are the best i can say about it,gripes are the main reason i can think of to
1,the plot has to go to an old,the only real surprise was the ending
1,save yourself the time read on your own,save your money and do n't spend your money
1,the first is the first movie and is very very bad,the film is a very good and original film that i recommend
1,however the movie is just as bad as its bad acting and,however in the end the film is just a little dull
1,the film has an excellent ensemble cast,the movie is about a group of young
1,this is what i think a film like this is not,this is a great movie about a man who has a son
1,the acting in the movie is very good although i do n't blame them for that,the story was a complete waste of time i do n't know who is who
1,fortunately the movie is n't that much fun and the film,fortunately he has a lot of talent as a writer
1,there 's some good acting by john cusack and some of the other actors in the movie,there was a little more depth in that part of the story and that 's it
1,greg araki has an interesting cameo but i think the story is so much,greg araki 's first feature length films are the ones i have seen
1,while it is n't the best movie ever made it does a very good job of showing the true love,while the film has a great deal of humor there are some scenes that are very funny and funny
1,example the fact that this is a film is n't a problem but the acting the directing and the special effects make this a film that will keep you wondering aloud,example i would love to see more of the same old same actors but they do n't look like they were from a very high school project or they were doing something
1,honestly i would n't say it,honestly if you are a diehard fan
1,and the movie does an okay job of portraying the characters,and i do think i 'd like a good one and that
1,i was very impressed by the way the story unfolded in the first place,i have a hard time figuring out if this film is meant to be a
1,i would not say it is a bad film but it certainly has some good acting and,i think the director 's cut is the most important aspect of what is going on
1,it was a waste of film,it 's not just that the plot
1,yes the plot line has some holes and,yes this is a very good film
1,perhaps that 's because i have n't seen anything that has,perhaps this was the first movie i was looking for
1,the movie is a little boring at times and the acting is just a little,the acting is n't all that bad but the story is n't very original
1,expecting that you will be disappointed with the acting,expecting the best to come and the movie has to
1,makes no difference to the other two,makes for a very funny movie and if
1,after watching this i was surprised to discover that there was a good story and some good actors,after seeing the film and seeing some other films that are in the same league with a group of
1,the film 's story is not a very interesting one,the film was a complete waste of my time
1,the only thing this movie has going for it is,the movie was a complete waste of my time
1,i am surprised it 's been released,i do n't want to give anything away
1,one of the funniest films about the war,one of the best movies ever made and it
1,hoffman is one of the best actors in the world and,hoffman 's character is so unlikable and yet so stupid
1,he is a real artist and is,he was n't a good actor
1,it was so bad i was laughing out loud,it is a story about a young couple traveling to
1,i was surprised by this film,i think that it was n't a
1,different than a movie this is one of those movies that you should not,different things like it 's a dream movie that 's just plain silly
1,so the movie is not about the family of,so much of what happens in the movie
1,however the film is n't all that great and it is not the best movie that has made,however the movie 's story and characters are underdeveloped the story is simple and the plot is so bad
1,top billed the acting is very good especially for the lead actor,top notch i love lucy liu but this is not one of her
1,it 's just a fun ride in my book,it 's a pity it was n't released theatrically
1,after seeing the movie i was really impressed with the story which was the first thing that i,after a while the movie is just a bunch of random idiots who do a good job
1,mgm is n't as good in this movie as this one,mgm has made this movie in the us and in my opinion
1,not a good sign of this movie and it is not,not to mention the fact that the entire film is so bad
1, is not only an average film about the holocaust but a good, this movie is an example of how to create a film
1,to begin it is a great film that has the potential to be a good movie,to say this is about a movie i would not have seen would be a good thing
1,the story has the potential of a bad movie that 's not funny,the film is a bit slow but the characters are interesting and the film
1,it is very hard to imagine that the film makers are not trying to be serious,it 's a shame that it 's not even available in video format and is not available
1,but i ca n't say enough of,but this movie is so boring
1,but this is the most ridiculous movie,but it is a great movie
1,yes the movie is a little over the top but it 's not as good as the original it,yes there are moments of comedy that were supposed to shock but the actors were really really bad
1,missions and demons are n't very convincing as they have no sense of danger to the story,missions are not always the most important to any of them but this movie is a complete disgrace
1,i am so upset at how this film is so good and so far fetched that i just have to say that it did n't have a very,i have n't heard of this movie in my entire life i 've only been in the uk and i have been watching it countless times since
1,contrast with the original is the most beautiful scene of this movie,contrast to the story the characters were so interesting to watch
1,he has the most memorable scene,he has done a fine job in
1,in a scene where the camera crew has the ability,in a way that was not funny at all
1,but i guess that was n't the point,but the movie is a complete mess
1,funny but it 's still a good movie,funny thing about it is that it has so
1,the movie does contain a couple of nice shots but the acting,the movie was so awful that it was hard to watch
1,i was so disappointed that it was so awful,i think you should have had to wait for a
1,this is a great film for everyone who wants to see a good movie,this is a very funny movie and i recommend it as a great movie to
1,pardon me if this movie is a masterpiece,pardon me and leave the movie open to the
1,i saw this movie at the boston international film festival and it was the,i would n't even watch this movie if i could have done it
1,well this movie is a good one,well i do n't want to spoil the
1,what is the deal with the movie,what makes the film stand out is its
1,lolita is a movie that makes you want to watch it,lolita is a very very good movie that i will never forget
1,the plot was pretty simple and i could not wait,the movie itself is a bit slow paced and very poorly
1,this movie was so bad i had to turn my eyes in disbelief to watch it and then i,this was a really good movie and was n't a good movie but it definitely is n't bad
1,compared to the first film i have no idea how the movie ends,compared to the original the series had a very different plot line
1,it was just a movie to try and make sense,it 's a shame that the film has no real stars
1,either way it 's a great movie to,either way he 's the perfect person
1,it 's the story of a young woman whose life is shattered in her family life by a young and loving woman named lena,it is a great piece of cinema that will make you laugh and you will see it coming out of your wits for the first
1,when i was a teenager i saw a screening of my childhood and i loved it,when the two leads were murdered the police officers had a few seconds and no one cared
1,the acting is so good that they are actually funny and not just a bad movie,the film 's only flaw is that it does not seem to be a lot of other
1,what 's the deal with the guy who 's got to be the most annoying person i have witnessed,what 's even worse is the script itself which is so bad the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous
1,that said this movie has been released,that is what makes it work
1,the only good part was the one in which the girl is supposed to be,the film is a great vehicle for a movie but i doubt it is
1,leave the theater for an old fashioned and funny performance from the director who has,leave and right and then the rest of the movie is just plain stupid
1,it is not a documentary that 's not worth a second look,it was a little too long and i do n't think it was
1,and i was n't even a little surprised by the ending,and the fact that the film was made for tv is a
1,although this is the first movie i 've seen i can honestly say it is one of the worst horror films,although the movie does have a very strong story it does n't have to be a movie to have it
1,so the only thing that was missing,so what was it all about
1,her husband is a man who is n't afraid to go to bed,her husband 's daughter has been married to her son and is now in
1,this movie is about a young woman who has to get,this film was just too much for me to like
1,this movie was n't even worth watching,this movie has a great soundtrack and is
1,while the first film is quite enjoyable with many of the characters it is also the first time,while watching a few episodes of the series it 's not as simple and shocking as the original but
1,it 's just that i do n't know where the real thing,it was a great story and a good movie to watch
1,they are all very funny and it 's funny to see the same old man in a,they do n't know how to make the movie but they 're not really good either
1,6 the movie is not for all tastes,6 the film opens in one scene with two
1,i do n't even want to spoil it for you because it is a great movie,i think this movie is the best of all the lists of movies i have ever seen
1,it 's not as good as a few,it would have made a great movie
1,he also meets a young girl named melissa who is a,he was not a good man and a good actor
1,by the way i have no idea what happened when i saw this movie in the theater,by the time the movie started it was a little confusing but i found the ending to be
1,but the film has to go down as such,but if you do n't know how to handle the
1,try and find some good horror movies and you 'll have a lot,try and find a better film in this genre and not to say the
1,if the film is not bad enough they are all pretty good,if you want some fun and fun this film will probably be a
1,it would seem that the director was making an attempt to make this story and it failed miserably,it 's like the director was trying to make something more interesting and he just could n't care less
1,we are told why he 's the father of a man who has been raised by the death of,we get the impression that he 's the only actor in the cast who could have been better
1,in short it is very well done and well written,in the first half of the film the characters get into
1,the movie has a very good soundtrack and the music is very good,the plot is not that good but the actors are great especially alexandra warren
1,the movie is a good example of how not to make a,the acting was bad at first but the movie just sucked
1,it 's not a bad idea for a movie to be a good one,it 's also not the first thing that has n't been mentioned in the previous
1,the only real standout was the fact that this movie was n't even nominated for a award,the plot is so ridiculous and the acting is so wooden it makes the movie even harder to
1,even though i do n't think this was,even the music is not much better
1,it is the story of two men who have been married to a woman who has lost their husband and has the,it has a few laughs to it that i liked about it the first few seconds or so of the movie
1,in the end he 's a very bad boy,in short it was a very good movie
1,it is not that i am a fan of films but,it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
1,my favorite part of the movie was the way the camera was so bad,my favorite line when it was in the movie was the ending where the hero
1,the film is set in a small rural village where the world of the,the plot is a bit thin but the story is told very well
1,meanwhile a friend and his wife are murdered by a mysterious woman and his daughter,meanwhile the man who kills the girl and her daughter who are now married to a
1,the plot is n't too bad either and there are so many things wrong with,the first time i saw this film i had n't seen the film before
1,also there was a very clever performance by the actress who plays the,also starring john hurt in another film about the same subject matter
1,i have n't seen this one since i was a young kid,i was really surprised to find that the movie has been a success
1,or the director who has a good sense of humor,or maybe they would 've been able to make a more
1,sincerely i do agree with the other posters that the acting in,sincerely i was surprised that this film got released on video
1,it 's like the filmmakers of the original show forgot it was just stupid because there,it 's a shame that they are not able to get out of the film
1,after a few minutes of the movie we are left to ponder what happened in the end,after watching it it 's hard to imagine that any film that could have made a better film
1,she 's not the only one to get a kick out of her mouth,she is the most likable character in the film so she does n't seem to
1,i would n't have to say anything about him but that,i have seen all of this movie in my time
1,i was expecting it to be a bad movie but that is what i 'd call the average zombie movie,i am not the only people on this board who have n't read it before and the film has a lot
1,in a way the movie is just a collection of scenes that are n't explained,in fact the movie is a lot of fun and a very good one
1,he 's also a great fighter in a film,he 's also not the least bit funny
1,all in all the movie is a great movie to,all in all i would recommend seeing this movie
1,i have a soft idea of what a film was made for the first hour,i think this movie is a perfect example of how to make a movie
1,that would be a good thing,that would be an insult to the
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not even available,it has the potential of the story of a serial killer that
1,but it is still one of the most memorable and enjoyable films of the year,but if you can get to the end this movie will make you laugh and say
1,i was n't impressed with the ending which was really disappointing,i think they should have done this a few more times
1,marcos has been living in his own home,marcos has to be a complete jerk
1,that 's the reason why this show was made,that was not a bad thing in it that is
1,although there is a few moments of the movie i can tell the story is not a comedy or a drama at all,although i have a feeling that this is not a horror movie there are many moments in it that are so funny that you
1,pip 's brother is also a little bit older than,pip 's character is n't the least bit funny
1,the story is about a bunch of teenagers who,the film is a little over the top
1,but that 's the only reason i can,but it 's not a good film
1,in this movie the main character is killed in a car crash to the police station in the beginning of the story,in addition the acting is horrible with a couple of bad actors in this one who are trying to get out of the
1,i have to admit this movie was great and i was really surprised with the acting,i saw this movie yesterday and it was one of the most enjoyable films i 've ever
1,the only redeeming value of this movie is the acting,the movie was made to be like a movie
1,time is very much a classic but it 's a great one that has a strong cast,time travel was one that could have been done better if it had been made in the us
1,the movie is a mess and is n't very entertaining at all,the first time i watched this i was n't impressed and did n't
1,i do n't think that a film should be made to entertain me about this travesty,i 've seen this movie a couple of times and i can understand why the critics hated
1,these were the two main problems with this movie,these were a couple of points in the film
1,hoping he would get a chance to make a better job in the industry as,hoping they would have given it a chance if it 's available on dvd
1,yet another thing is the film does n't seem to have,yet the story does a lot of the same things
1,although it 's not a total loss to see it at face value,although it does n't have the same impact that the movie has been there
1,i would love to say that there is a lot of things to,i 've been looking forward to this series since the first time
1,although he is not the only good character he 's supposed to be the main character he 's really the only person in,although it is a bit of an exercise in the history of the genre it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie
1,what is with all the other posters,what a waste of this movie
1,the acting is so bad that i found it embarrassing to,the film is a good mix of action and thriller
1,but that 's not all i can,but this is n't the case
1,so the only thing to be said is that,so the movie does n't work for me
1,there is no reason to see the original movie,there is no plot or character development that is n't
1,it has a lot of funny moments,it was a complete waste of film
1,instead the film takes a little too much to figure out,instead of having an extramarital relationship with a person who was a
1,a few weeks later the young man is the only one who is able to get a job in,a very bad thing that this is one of those movies that you just have to see it
1,such as these two movies and a few good ones,such a good cast is wasted and i do n't think
1,i think he 's the worst in a movie ever made,i think this movie is a complete waste of time and energy
1,do yourself a favor avoid this movie at all costs,do n't expect the same kind of ending to this film
1,i would like to see some of the actors in,i would have been better off watching the movie
1,craig sheffer 's performance was excellent and the film was a bit like a comedy,craig freeman is a great actor but it is his performance that makes this film
1,i do n't want to spoil anything about,i think the film was very good
1,yet the real problem with this movie is that the actors and the actors are not really trying to make,yet i still think that this is a movie that i will watch over and over again and again
1,if you 're going to make a movie about the evils of war and,if you do n't want to see this film go see the original
1,i would recommend this to everyone who is a fan of,i do n't think it is the best of all
1,john goodman as the villain was also a good one,john carradine and his partner are both very attractive and very
1,he 's a little over a top secret of his wife,he also gets a little too excited and he becomes a good
1,a film like the original was n't even nominated for best picture,a few years ago i was looking for the movie on tv and
1,robert deniro is perfect as his father who does his own stunts,robert downey jr is the only saving grace in this movie
1,but it 's a good idea that 's,but this movie has no redeeming qualities
1,well i do n't think i 've ever watched this movie,well it has some funny moments and the humor is so funny
1,a good example is the scene in the,a film about the evils of war
1,incidentally i am not a fan of the,incidentally the film is a complete mess
1,it seems that the director and cast members are trying to get to this point in a different direction,it seems as though they were going to make a film about the aftermath of the vietnam war
1,morris and his friend are all very good,morris 's character is a little twodimensional
1,another thing is it has a few things to say about movies,another problem is that the film does n't have to have a very
1,when i saw this movie at a festival i had to be,when i watched this show i thought it was very funny
1,in my opinion i would have given up the movie,in the end it was n't a good movie
1,however i think i would be entertained by watching this film,however the only problem with the film is that it is not
1,as for the story there is a bit of suspense and a lot of action,as for the film i was a bit skeptical of how it is made and i
1,johnny is the most beautiful and sexy of all his films,johnny is a very good movie as a whole but it really
1,the film is not for everyone but the first half of the movie has nothing to do with the plot and the characters are not believable,the film 's plot involves two friends who are invited to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an old man and the two of their lives
1,i 've seen this movie many times and it is so bad that they just ca n't believe it,i have to disagree with another reviewer that said the plot was very good the acting was ok the story
1,this movie does not have any redeeming features to make it worth mentioning,this is one of those movies that you ca n't watch because of its
1,the first one was the best of the three,the movie is a mess from the start
1,the only reason i wanted to watch this movie was because the acting was bad,the only thing to really have is that it 's the first of a string of
1,it seems that a bunch of people have been killed and killed off with a deadly,it 's all in the same place as the old lady and the lion king
1,a good story line and a good story but i think that the,a good film to be seen but not enough to be entertaining
1,vancouver is an absolute disgrace as the film 's main character is a caricature of the young age,vancouver 's greatest strength in this film is a very small cast and a great supporting cast including john
1,brenda fricker plays a character that is not afraid to accept her,brenda vaccaro is the only reason to give it a try
1,the first part of it is pretty good but i think there were many things wrong with this one,the movie starts with the main character telling her how he is going to be so wrapped up in an
1,now we have a bunch of friends with a bunch of friends,now i am a big fan of the original and even the most
1,it is a great movie that i,it was a very good movie
1,the movie is a very interesting film about how people are going to work and work on the subject,the film also stars a young woman who is in love with one of her patients a woman
1,that 's the whole point of view,that would be a good idea because they
1,you will be surprised that the director 's commentary is so stupid,you can tell the plot was a good idea for a movie but
1,caution is a film that should be seen by anyone looking for a good movie but if,caution is not a good movie but i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the movies
1,scary movie 3 is n't a good film as it is,scary movie that has a few redeeming features like that
1,the film opens with a very strong climax which is so powerful and so satisfying,the movie is about a man who is obsessed with a murder case that goes on
1,the movie is n't even funny or entertaining,the movie itself is a very poor attempt at
1,in my opinion it is not a great movie,in the end it 's a movie you can do
1,an interesting film about the holocaust of the soviet union during a time war,an excellent performance by david suchet who is one of the best actors of the
1,the script is a complete mess,the story is so simple it 's
1,in fact i would have liked to have had more fun with the story,in fact i did n't think this could ever be a horror movie
1,unfortunately i was surprised to find that a lot of people were,unfortunately i think that the filmmakers were the best to come
1,this is the type of film where it is very difficult for,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,in fact it 's a good thing that a film like that could be made,in my personal opinion it has been a very successful movie in my book
1,it is the story of a young woman who is a woman from the age of 16 and who lives,it 's a pity that they do n't have the same kind of film that i have not seen
1,he is not even funny at all,he has a nice body and a very
1,while the plot has a lot to live up to it 's flaws and the,while the movie does n't have a plot line the movie is very funny
1,but i was a bit disappointed with the plot,but the film has some very very very nice touches
1,while it was a long time since the early talkies were n't even nominated the oscars were on a lot of the production,while he does n't get it it 's very hard to find the right balance to be the first of many films and the
1,but this one is n't even that bad,but the movie is a very enjoyable movie
1,the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie was because,the only redeeming feature of the entire production is the music
1,the story revolves around three young men that have been married to,the plot is simple and very predictable to say the least
1,the film opens with a very nice scene,the plot is so simple and so implausible that
1,since he is a real good man he has the ability to create a new life of the world and that we can relate to it,since the movie is based on a play and the book and i do n't think it is a movie to say it is n't a bad
1,jennifer connelly is a good actress but she was so good in this one,jennifer tilly plays a young woman who is trying to find her husband
1,this film is the worst i 've ever seen,this movie was just a waste of time for the
1,as a whole i am a fan of the series so i am not a fan of the original,as for the story itself well it has a good script and a decent premise but it is a little
1,i 've never seen such a beautiful cast as i am not sure whether i should be,i have to admit that i have not seen a film that i have ever seen
1,the story is n't all that good,the movie is very very funny
1,this film should be banned by everyone who,this film had me laughing out loud
1,naturally the film does have the same effect on me as,naturally the film is a little bit of a disappointment
1,however i was not able to find any redeeming qualities at all,however as for the movie itself well it 's just not
1,i was so bored by this movie that i did n't even know it was a,i think it is a very good example of how a movie can be made
1,aside from the fact that it was not a total disaster,aside from that this movie does n't have a plot
1,then again he 's in the movie and the movie does a,then i was in a theater where the film was made
1,do the writers and producers do not make the film a,do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time
1,in fact it 's so bad it 's good,in the end he realizes that the world can be
1,then we have the token and unintelligent hero of the title and the girl,then there were the bad guys in this movie who are all the same
1,it 's a shame that the director,it is a very bad movie
1,this is an excellent film which has a lot of great actors,this movie is about a young boy who has been living his life
1,into my mind is not the only thing that makes it interesting,into this one is that the story of the film was so bad
1,there is a lot of action and the film does,there 's a lot of action in this flick
1,there is some very good acting performances but they are all very good,there are a number of funny gags that are supposed to be funny
1,just because it is not a horror film is just plain silly,just when you think it 's the best thing in the movie it
1,for the longest and most rewarding scene i have seen in the past,for the first half of the movie it was a great movie
1,the movie has a few twists that are n't so much to,the movie was very well made and it was very realistic
1,and then the scene in which a man walking around,and that 's the only reason to watch it
1,narcissistic and dumber the plot was so stupid that it was difficult to make,narcissistic characters are introduced by people who have n't been a real person since the
1,we all have a different view of the film,we have seen this film many times but i can
1,edward norton 's character seemed very familiar in the first two parts,edward brophy plays the father 's father and his mother and son is
1,we 're left wondering how much longer the writers are to,we all know the story and it 's so bad
1,the film is an exercise in futility and death and the final battle is a little slow paced,the plot is a bit of a clich one might have thought that the director could have been cast
1,claire forlani is one of the greatest actors ever to have the ability to convey a role as a young actress,claire danes plays the role as a woman of high school who 's a bit more than a little too old for
1,just the same thing over and over again,just as i was watching a film about the
1,is it a matter of the power,is that a matter of time and time
1,spoiler ahead spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoiler spoilers alert this movie is about two people who are killed and tortured by a mysterious psychopath,spoiler alert the ending was a bit too abrupt but i was surprised when i found out that this film was actually a sequel to the book
1,it 's a great film for the whole family,it is n't a very good film it is n't
1,a movie with a very good story,a very good film about a serial killer
1,the first time i saw this i was really impressed with the acting,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends going to a new house
1,after the war the war erupts,after the first half of the movie
1,this is the kind of movie that i,this is an excellent film to watch
1,in short it was a pretty decent movie that was not only the,in this respect it is the most memorable thing i 've seen
1,it 's not the worst movie ever made or even worse the worst of it it is not,it was the only movie i had seen that actually had something to do with the movie
1,with that said i would n't say this is an entertaining movie,with this film and the cast and crew the script is a real
1,best line about the movie is what the,best of all it is a movie
1,for all of you people you 're going to love this movie but do n't expect too much,for the most part the music is a little stilted and the plot is just too old
1,the movie is not a good film it is not even a bad movie,the only thing that kept me from turning this movie off was the way the
1,rather than a horror movie there are some interesting scenes,rather than a movie in this case the characters and situations
1,shots that make you want to see more of them get involved in the movie,shots are used as a tool to convey a sense of the moods of the story
1,most of the movie has to be the dullest thing i have ever seen,most of the cast members including christopher walken and michael douglas are so good as
1,yes i know it 's not a bad idea but i do n't really care about anyone,yes the film 's plot was a little predictable but the plot was so bad and the acting
1,really it 's a movie you 'll want to miss if,really bad movie with a few exceptions to the story
1,of course the film has a good cast with,of course it is a bit too long
1,russell is also excellent as his wife who is a bit too long too young to be too shy to be a good character and the acting was very,russell and his cohorts are in the same place but in a small time warp in paris it was not so hard on this day of the west
1,i am a big fan of the series of the series,i 've been watching the movie several times since it was released
1,they 're not even in the movie and the movie does n't make any sense,they have to make a movie with some great actors and this one is not a
1,i have to say that this movie really does suck the way the movie is set,i think the film 's biggest asset is how to make such a poor film
1,it has some great actors and some good moments but i do,it has a lot of potential and some very memorable moments
1,it 's a shame the writers could n't have been cast as the original,it 's not so easy to follow it to the point where you can see
1,as it stands it seems that there was nothing to make it,as for the movie itself it is a very enjoyable film
1,in my opinion he did a great job of showing the true love of his character and how he,in the end you 'll find that this is the most difficult to sit through the whole movie
1,i 've been a fan of the series for the last few months and this is the,i saw the movie in the theater and was n't expecting it to be a masterpiece
1,all i could think about was the scene where they were supposed to look like a cross,all of the characters in this film have been killed in the beginning of the movie
1,i do n't think that this is a bad movie,i do n't see what you do last summer and you
1,yes the film is set in ireland but that 's about it,yes he has a little bit of a fixation but he just ca
1,i am amazed that the director did n't have to,i think this should have been a good movie
1,it 's a shame that the film did n't have much to offer but it was a great movie,it seems that this film was filmed on the cheap backlot but the filmmakers decided to make an improvement on
1,the story is a little confusing,the film is about a group of
1,we get a glimpse at the nature of war and how we see a film in which a person,we get the usual bad of a bad bad joke about a guy who is a little boy
1,he 's a very funny person who wants,he 's just not a good actor
1,there 's a few interesting things in this movie that are n't even mentioned,there is a scene in which he goes to the police station with her and
1,this is a film about two people living in a different world where each other is different together,this movie is so bad that it is hard to describe the actors at this point in their lives
1,george romero was n't the first movie to show the world he was,george romero 's direction is the only highlight of this film as he is
1,marsh 's character is not funny,marsh is in this movie and he
1,mcshane is a great villain and i was surprised to see him,mcshane has a small role and the supporting cast is good
1,a few people say it 's not a,a good movie and an excellent one
1,having been a huge fan of any of my favorite horror movies i,having said that the film was a waste of time and money
1,great story line and good acting,great acting and wonderful direction and editing
1,kate beckinsale is a revelation as her character in an attempt,kate beckinsale was a very good choice for her part
1,george lucas is the best director in the world,george clooney is perfect in this film but he 's
1,i do n't know if that would be a good film if,i was surprised by what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish
1,how did the cops find the killer,how can you make a film like that
1,a film like this is not a,a lot of it 's humor
1,girls are not the only ones that can be forgiven and the plot is so stupid that it 's impossible for,girls do n't want to have sex with them or they should not be taken care of by the other
1,we are not talking about the characters,we get to see the first half of
1,i was really impressed by the movie,i do agree that i have to admit
1,set in a small town in the us this is a good movie,set in the present day globalization is a great story of a young couple
1,this show has been made by a bunch of children who are just not,this movie has a very low budget and is a very interesting movie
1,not only is this film boring it also has a couple of funny scenes,not a lot of the film has been cut down to a standard level
1,was n't it just a matter of the matter,was this movie supposed to be a spoof of the
1,on the surface the movie is very good,on the whole this movie was a good and
1,what a great movie a great idea for an actor to act and,what a great idea this is to see a very bad movie
1,am i a teenager with a heart of gold that 's so good,am i going to say that if you 're looking for a good movie
1,subsequently it is a film that you will enjoy watching,subsequently i have to say that this movie is a perfect
1,unfortunately i was not sure what to expect from this movie,unfortunately this is a very bad movie and i did n't know
1,and the movie is really bad,and the ending is a joke that
1,brian blessed has done a good job as well but he did,brian blessed 's acting was so bad that it was laughable
1,a very funny movie that i thought,a few scenes are pretty decent
1,the story is simple and the acting is pretty good especially from the leads who make the whole thing look good,the movie starts off with a very long shot of one person running around a desk talking at a door
1,washington 's performance is the only one who could,washington 's character was a very strong character
1,i 've never seen this one but it was n't a great film,i would n't be surprised if i saw this as a movie
1,and i think that the only thing this,and the whole thing was so predictable
1,a very funny and funny movie,a great movie with a good performance
1,i have n't seen such a good film since i had seen the,i would n't have bothered to see this one for a while
1,still this is definitely a film that you can watch and enjoy,still the plot is a bit too thin for a bmovie with the
1,i am not the only one,i was hoping that some of her
1,when i first viewed this film i was expecting something a little more,when it 's over you 're going to watch the same movie
1,along with this i have to say that i have n't seen it since,along with the great cinematography and the excellent cast this one does manage to keep
1,the script is not the worst of it 's problems but the acting is good enough,the story line was a lot better and it had a bit of humor but it seemed
1,a great cast including the leads and some excellent supporting players especially david warner,a lot of people say it 's a good movie but the acting and the
1,it is a shame that this movie is so bad that it 's not even good enough to be good,it 's not that i do n't think he is a real person but i think they 're going to get
1,the first half of this movie was very well done,the movie is about a guy who gets a job and
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies,i would recommend this movie to everyone
1,some of the scenes of the murders are quite interesting and the film 's plot is very strong,some of the other reviews i 've read about this film have made it a point to see this
1,it has the worst special effects i have ever seen on film,it has a lot of plot holes to do with the plot but
1,some of the dialogue is very funny but that 's just it,some of the actors and actresses do n't seem to work as a
1,both films are the best of the series,both the movie is very well done
1,we all laughed at our seats,we have a bunch of teenagers who
1,it was an accident in the world of war and it shows a great deal of compassion for,it 's not that we do n't like the original the way it was in this movie
1,though i have no idea what i would have thought,though the story is n't too bad it is still very
1,if you 're looking for a film about the holocaust and the troubles of war and remembrance,if i had n't been so impressed i 'd have to say the movie was good
1,both films have a great cast and are not afraid,both films are a lot more exciting to watch
1,so i guess the director and director of the movie had a different approach to it but they did n't even try to make it funny,so if you 're looking for a fun movie i recommend seeing that i am a fan of movies and i really enjoyed a movie about the
1,it is n't a comedy or a comedy,it 's like they just wanted it to end
1,i have seen this movie and i have to admit that i am not a,i would n't have bothered to write this review if i had not been
1,what is the point of making the film,what was the point of this movie
1,nick nolte is a delight as he is,nick nolte is a very good guy
1,randy quaid 's portrayal of an older man is a bit of an eccentric but somewhat likable character,randy hopper and john cleese are the only real stars and the film is so much more than a
1,my favorite part was with the girl who 's not going to get her husband,my advice skip this film and watch the film and you will be disappointed
1,for the first half of a long time the audience was laughing at the stupidity of the characters as if the filmmakers,for all i love the music and the songs of this one i do n't want to spoil it for you
1,the story line is about as good as the original,the story was so bad that it seemed almost tacked on
1,now that 's the only thing i,now this is a bad movie
1,this is a movie you 'd probably see,this is what you 're thinking of
1,in fact it was a good idea to make a sequel to,in fact the movie has a lot of action in it
1,to begin with the movie 's story is very good and the acting is quite good,to me i was not disappointed by the film 's lack of a decent cast
1,i saw the film at sundance and have heard that i was n't a fan of,i have not read the novel but i 've already seen it a few times
1,the only way you 'll see this film are the performances that are not the only reason i can find it in the first place,the only problem with the film is that it has a few twists but a lot of the movie ends with a very good and very
1,when you 're a kid it is a real treat to hear that it 's,when they finally see a movie that has the look of a bad thing
1,a few of the scenes involve some of the best acting i have ever seen,a film that should have been made by the director in the beginning of the movie
1,otherwise this is one of my favorites,otherwise the film 's plot is a little
1,but the movie was a lot more than it was in a movie about a,but the best thing about it was that they could have done the job
1,anyway this movie was a waste of time,anyway this is a great movie for all ages
1,i 've never heard of it before but still it has been my favorite disney film,i think the movie is n't the greatest film ever made but the best one
1,in my opinion i would have liked some more if,in the first scene the characters are the same
1,jill clayburgh and her supporting cast are all very good,jill silverman does a good job as the mom and she
1,the movie was shot at a time when the,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,the movie was a little too long,the story is so bad and so ridiculous
1,that is how they are able to keep a straight face,that was a good thing but that 's about it
1,i am so glad i watched this film,i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and
1,i think it was a waste of time,i am sure that the producers of this film
1,in short the film has a few flaws in it that are n't quite as memorable as the original,in the meantime of his career his mother and daughter are forced to accept that they are both in love
1,this is a film that you will not miss if you do n't know what to expect,this is not to say the acting is bad but it was so much better than the script
1,steven seagal was a great actor but the rest of the cast seemed forced by the other actors,steven spielberg 's films do n't make a lot of sense and i do n't think that it is
1,by the end of the end we have two characters in the movie that were supposed to do the same,by the end of the movie i was just wishing they would put it back together in the future
1,i am a sucker for this kind of stuff and i do n't really want to give away a,i saw this on the tube and the sundance version is pretty much an insult to the original
1,if it was on cable and the dvd cover would be worth it,if i had to give a 0 and the only negative rating i could
1,yes the film was a lot better but the story was weak,yes this is a good movie it 's not very original or interesting
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,this film is so bad that it makes no sense at all
1,a few things do n't seem to have the same sense of reality to it in the first place,a few minutes later we learn a little about the story of an old man who has a heart attack
1,the story itself is about a young woman named laura who has a crush on her own mother,the film is not a complete waste of time but the story is pretty basic it is a very
1,an excellent film that has been shown to be a,an example of what a superhero is a movie
1,from the beginning you get the feeling that the director is trying to make something more interesting and then it ends up with some very bad acting that just does n't work out,from there he 's a pretty cool actor but he is so stupid in that you have to wonder if she 's going to get a little too much credit to him
1,blood dolls in the first movie were n't a good one either,blood vidal was in the film for a few minutes but i guess
1,i saw the trailer for this movie on television and i had to wait for it to get,i am not going to spoil it for you but i will give this movie a 4
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and liked the movie i strongly recommend,if i had n't read the book i could n't have been more disappointed
1,i was a little confused about the movie,i saw the film on the shelf the day
1,it is also an odd movie with some,it would be a waste of time
1,many people have mentioned that this film was a great film with the exception of being a big,many of us have seen this movie and i have a lot of experience for the music
1,so the movie is a lot like a movie in which the characters are not developed to each story,so the film is a little bit of a spoof but the story is a bit of a mess
1,many of the characters are very annoying and there 's no reason to care about any of them either,many people have seen him in the film but this movie was n't even close to being a good one
1,these are not all examples of that,these are the two main characters in this
1,truly the worst movie i have ever seen,truly this is an enjoyable little film
1,the film is a complete mess,the plot has some holes and it
1,however the acting of the main cast,however the story was very weak
1,as it turns out she did n't have a single mother and she has a heart of gold to live,as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly confusing and boring at times but it 's a very good film
1,though it is a little too long and it 's not the same,though it is not the best movie i have ever seen the movie is
1,gulliver has the ability to be the hero of the film and the whole affair is the same,gulliver is a great movie that should have been called upon the joker and it was a great movie
1,now the plot was a complete mess,now i have to disagree with all the
1,since then i 've seen the same thing with my friend and we 're not so sure why it 's so bad,since i was watching it for the first time i was so moved by the fact that it had to be one of
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this film is a complete disgrace to any american film
1,i saw this film when i was 11 and was absolutely shocked,i was so disappointed that i found myself wishing that the filmmakers could
1,i have no idea that the director is,i was n't impressed by the film
1,stop it from me and watch it,stop motion of the movie and the acting
1,a very good and interesting film for all the wrong reasons,a very good film that should be seen by many people
1,it is a great movie that is so great it 's almost funny,it is also one of the most underrated films i have seen for a
1,or maybe it was just too long,or the director or whatever they do
1,another example of a good horror movie,another thing that is missing is that a
1,please if you want to see a good film that is,please do not watch this movie it 's worth seeing
1,this movie has a great premise but i do not think the film,this film had a few funny moments but they were not really
1,i do n't remember seeing this movie when it was released,i do n't know why i did not like these things so
1,he is also a great actor but he plays a very complex character who is a real loser,he is a very good actor he has no talent in his acting and it is hard to imagine
1,of course the plot is not that good,of course i do n't think that it is
1,i think it 's the most accurate movie to be made,i am surprised that such a movie has a reputation in the
1,while i was in a coma at the time when i was a child this is a great film,while i do n't care for these characters and not the story itself it 's also a very good story
1,the film was so boring that i wanted to watch the movie to the end of the film,the plot is not really that interesting and the acting was not the best but it 's pretty good
1,this movie was not the first movie to,this was a good movie for me
1,this is one of those shows that i have watched,this is a great movie for everyone to watch
1,i saw the film on a whim of,i was surprised to read this review
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it makes,the movie is so bad that it is almost embarrassing
1,he 's got a good sense of humour and,he was just too old for words too
1,he is the one who does n't like it so much,he had the potential to pull off the part of the movie
1,really the film is a complete mess that is not worth the time or,really i am not a fan and the film is just plain awful
1,this is a movie that makes you laugh and cry,this film has a few good moments and it 's a
1,there are some great scenes and the scene where he is trying to get the girl to work on the show,there are no real plot elements no story no plot no plot no story and nothing just makes it boring
1,thank goodness i did n't get the chance to see this,thank god i did n't see it at the cinema
1,it 's a shame that it was made in the early 70 's and i still think this is a great movie,it is a story about a young man who is a little bit of a mixed bag with a family that is the
1,not to mention it 's a good movie that i do n't understand but it is n't,not a single thing that 's funny about it it 's a great deal of fun
1,the story is pretty simple and the actors who are involved in their own life,the film also does a good job of portraying a woman as her husband as she
1,that was the worst of the movie,that 's because i have to say that
1,apparently a lot of people have been killed but this movie had so many plot holes that i felt compelled to write it off and say it,apparently the movie did n't have a clue to this movie but it was the first film that i saw in the series and i did n't care
1,although this film is not about the same subject matter that we all knew it would be about the world it would be,although the movie is not the worst film i 've seen i have no idea what 's going on it seems to be the
1,the film is a little boring but i guess that 's,the movie is very entertaining and the actors were excellent
1,it 's a great movie to see and see,it also has a very funny and entertaining scene when
1,i'm afraid this film is a masterpiece,i'm sorry but the movie does n't really
1,i do n't know how to tell you this story is not a great one as we see the characters and their motivations but they also do a lot of things like,i think that if it were n't for the good acting and the fact that i was watching it on television it did n't make me want to watch it again
1,the only saving graces for me are the special effects and,the plot is pretty thin and the plot is ridiculous
1,certainly a film that is a little,certainly a good movie to watch
1,raising his head and his family 's life he becomes a hero to a tee of the imagination which would be a better place,raising his own hands and the head and the man is so bad that you ca n't help but feel like i was in the
1,the plot is so simple it makes you feel the need to have a few good things to do but that is what this film is,the only reason i can find the reason for the film in which the film is based is that the director and the writer of this film
1,definitely it is the fact that it is the first of the two films to be directed by the,definitely recommended if only the filmmakers and director had to make a feature film in the same year
1,1010 and i have seen a few bad horror films,1010 and i'm a generous fan of horror movies
1,john wayne was great as the villain,john carpenter and his writer michael moore are
1,thankfully it is n't a film,thankfully the film has some good acting
1,legend of a serial killer is not one of the best movies but the fact that it 's a horror,legend of the phantasm is a movie about the evil killer scarecrow the snowman and frankenstein and his mate
1,i am a huge fan of the original and even so i was n't expecting something more,i would like to see this movie again in a theater and that 's why i bought it
1,true the film has its moments but there 's not enough to keep,true the movie is a bit too much of an overlong mess
1,after a while we are supposed to be reminded that this film,after all that i have been trying to locate my family
1,after the first hour or so i started watching a bunch of old,after reading the book the story was very similar to the book
1,never before have we seen him before we see him and the rest of the cast is not as bad as the script,never have i seen a movie with such a bad director and i ca n't even think of the good points in my mouth
1,if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll love this one,if this is the best i can i think about it in that respect
1,this movie is just a bad movie that tries to,this movie was a complete waste of my time
1,i was a little hesitant to watch it,i am a huge fan of the first three
1,to say so but i have a problem,to make sure you are a kid
1,this is the story of a young woman in a small village in the early 1930s when she meets a beautiful woman,this is a very bad movie it 's so bad that it makes it hard to sit through a movie like this
1,yet another reason why i give this movie a 4 out of 10 is that it has a very,yet i ca n't think of another film that i did not like and this one is not
1,you know what to expect from the,you 'll be glad you did
1,they should 've given the director a,they were both good and evil
1,lucinda is not a good character actor but he does a good job,lucinda is a young man whose father is killed in the hospital
1,the movie does a good job of showing it as a very bad movie,the movie is not so much of an impact that it is just a little
1,they all do n't have enough time to make the,they were n't in the movie as a whole
1,i am a little prejudiced of how the filmmakers and director should come out of the picture as it is a good way of explaining it in,i have never watched the show but it is n't a very good idea and i would have liked to have seen more episodes of it
1,he was a very talented actor of the period,he is a good guy and he has done a
1,and it 's like the writers have no intention to make a movie that is supposed,and it 's a shame that such a bad film is n't available on vhs
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is a bit of an excuse to get the plot,the movie also features two different characters a la belle a transsexual an exiled woman and a woman
1,i have to say i liked it but it was not,i saw this movie when i was 11 years old
1,i would not have liked this show but it 's a great show,i am sure it 's a good idea for a movie but the script
1,heroes are sent to jail to find,heroes are n't always the same
1,billy connolly is a good actor,billy wilder has the right amount of
1,of course the film does contain a bit of a lot of the same,of course there 's a bit of blood but that 's about it
1,i would n't recommend it to the masses or even the prudish,i am amazed that it was made in the us in this movie
1,i saw this movie when it first aired on a friday night and thought it looked pretty good,i have n't seen the first film yet but i still have to admit that the story is a
1,otherwise i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad film,otherwise i would say that the film was not so much fun but the
1,in the case of the film it is a very long way that is not only,in the end it is a very interesting movie but it 's a little weak
1,the acting by all is excellent,the first part of the movie is
1,currently i am not going to be able to find this movie in any format,currently i can understand that the filmmakers did n't want to see any film in the
1,naturally this is not an accurate film and it 's difficult not to like the,naturally it was n't the only film to get it banned as a comedy
1,just a few seconds of this movie,just as you can see it in a
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the first time i saw it i was so
1,originally the first movie is a good one,originally a remake of this movie was released on
1,i would have liked it a little more if the film was more of a documentary,i 've never read the book but the movie is very entertaining and well done
1,i am not a fan of the genre but i think the movie is great in the way that the movie,i was surprised to find that a film of this calibre could n't have possibly been a little more entertaining
1,it 's a pity that it was only released on dvd,it 's an example of what it is to make people believe
1,also the fact that this was made for tv is n't a great idea to watch,also the film 's title song is a little jarring and it 's hard not to notice
1,you can only see the film in an effort to make this a classic for everyone to laugh at,you can see that this film is not about the evils of war but it is about a young man
1,from the moment it was over the film seemed to have no purpose,from the very beginning we learn that this is a good film for the
1,and then the camera pans out of the window and they shoot it,and there was one scene in which a man walking down in a car
1,i think the movie is very good,i was so impressed with it so i
1,but this is just a very bad movie,but then the rest of the movie is just
1,it 's a pretty cool movie but you have to have something a little bit,it 's not a bad movie but i did enjoy the first film better
1,oh yes the story is very weak,oh yes the film 's main problem is
1,the only reason i did n't waste was that it had a lot of potential,the only thing that makes the film watchable is the fact that it 's not a
1,case in point you are not likely that you 'll be,case is a story of the life of two families
1,i have to admit to all the bad things about this film,i have n't read the book but i think the book does a
1,eva longoria is a great director who can,eva unger is also excellent as well
1,actor was not the only movie that made me laugh,actor and director of course is the real life of a
1,of course the real thing is it 's just a bit of a bad movie,of course the real estate agent who has to have the most important role in the
1,you can get the same feeling you 're watching a film,you can tell he is trying to be funny but fails miserably
1,anne heche is very sexy and sexy,anne francis plays the daughter who is a
1,he 's the only actor who can act in this one,he 's just a good actor and i do agree that he
1,the movie starts with a bunch of friends and they try and solve their problems,the only good thing to be said about this movie is the fact that it 's
1,it is also a shame that the film is more like,it is a great performance for everyone in the movie
1,anybody who thinks this film is the good will love it or just enjoy it,anybody who likes the first movie and even the original is the most annoying
1,it is a good movie to view,it 's a movie that has the best
1,as for me it 's not as bad as it could,as an avid fan of the show i was impressed
1,keep in mind that the director and director have been in a mental institution,keep in mind that this film was a success to the public library
1,they all had to do something with a movie that would have worked out as the original,they are the two main characters who come out of the blue zone and the family
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and should be,this film is a must see for any serious family
1,anyone who has seen any of this should be ashamed to have watched this one,anyone who does know this movie will get any more of a chance to experience this
1,i'm not a big fan of musicals that have made this movie,i'm a sucker for this sort of movies but this is n't one
1,i am amazed that i spent so much money on this movie,i do n't see how many films in the world can claim that
1,if you have n't seen this one do you wo n't like it,if you 've seen the first film or you 're a diehard fan of
1,worth the money and effort for this movie,worth the time to watch and if you 're
1,in a way that was a little too much and the fact that it was a movie made me want to throw my,in short it 's a movie with a lot of laughs and it is not the least bit of a screwball comedy
1,chris farley plays the character of a young man in his youth who is a man and his wife and his daughter is very good,chris is very well known but i ca n't help but think his role was so good that the whole thing seemed to have been shot
1,however it 's a great movie with some very,however it was the best of his career
1,the film is set against an exterior backdrop which is used to convey some tension,the film is about a woman who has visions of women in her home and has
1,save yourself a favor if you are into,save this one and get the movie
1,the film is n't a bad thing to say it is a bad movie,the first time we see the same movie the movie is a bit different in
1,well this was n't the only movie,well it 's not a movie
1,the acting was horrible the story weak and the ending was ridiculous,the script and direction are all over the top as if all of
1,notice the fact that it 's a little slow,notice that i was n't expecting too much
1,to be fair he was the most popular actor in the cast,to say that the plot is a bit too thin is beyond me
1,the movie is also very entertaining,the only reason i gave this movie
1,i 've read some negative reviews and i agree with the reviewer,i 've watched it countless times and i really appreciate it
1,check out the film for the first,check out all the other reviews
1,there 's also a bit of nudity in,there was a lot of violence here
1,which i think is a very nice thing,which is a shame because i 've seen this
1,now it 's not a good movie,now that 's a good thing
1,because of the fact that this is just another movie i think i have seen it all,because i 've read many of the comments about that i thought that this movie was a waste
1,he is one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema and i am pleased to say that this is one of my favorite films,he is a good person who does n't want a big tobacco company in a big country in order to prevent him from his wife
1,i have never seen a movie where you know this is bad bad bad and the worst movie i 've ever heard,i 've been looking for something like it ever since i have read the book and that it 's based on a true
1,anyway a movie like this could have been made in the first place but this one does,anyway this movie has some really great moments and is quite good for the first half
1,it is not as bad as it gets,it does n't work because it has the exact
1,it is a very bad movie to say the least,it 's a real shame because the movie is n't even
1,or maybe he just wants to get a job,or maybe the film was shot by the amateur director
1,real life is n't the first movie you have,real life has no place in the film
1,if you 're looking for a movie about the dangers of the art of the world of,if they are to be the next one to make sure you know what i mean
1,this film is a total embarrassment,this movie makes absolutely no sense
1,it does n't make much sense and i have a feeling of gratitude for this film but,it 's a shame that it was so bad and that it was released on dvd
1,beyond that it just seemed to have been shot,beyond a shadow of the doubt that this film is
1,herbert berger is a wonderful actor in,herbert lom plays the lead character
1,my favourite parts were the ones in which the girls were in front of the tv station,my only question would be that you could have done the same thing over and over again and
1,as for the acting of a young malcolm pacino he plays a character that is not in his best shape,as the story unfolds we see the whole film with the exception of a man who 's only a child is
1,they are not even good enough to make a good movie out of it,they were also in some ways a little too much for me to handle this
1,hey that 's right i have a hard time adjusting to a story,hey it 's not that great of a movie but i think it is
1,an example of the movie 's success is its ability to be a classic,an excellent film that i can recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre or
1,this is one of those movies that has nothing to offer the viewer,this is not a great movie but its very very very entertaining
1,christian bale plays the role of an indian,christian slater is a very talented actor
1,then there is that the story is just about a girl who wants the daughter to be a man,then it goes into the movie 's plot of a movie where it should be the same as the first
1,the film was a complete waste of money and money,the movie 's story is a simple one and it 's
1,so if you 've seen the other movies you have to wonder if the producers,so i do n't want to see a more accurate film about this topic
1,for those who want to know who the hell is the story it,for a movie about real life the audience will enjoy this film
1,similarly the film was filmed in a small,similarly a film of a young woman
1,surely a few years later the movie was made,surely i could have imagined a better movie
1,but the film is n't really a,but this was the last film
1,but that was about as much to the show as,but that aside the movie is a complete mess
1,and the acting is so bad that they are not funny,and the scene where they are walking off the street is a
1,the film is a complete mess but it 's a very funny,the acting in the movie is superb as are the actors
1,i think they are trying to show us that this movie was made by a child,i was expecting a bit of the story of a woman who was born with her mother
1,thirdly this was a great movie for everyone involved in,thirdly i have no idea who the killer is
1,this movie could have been better if they had had a better script,this is not a film for anyone who enjoys the genre of movies
1,the acting was so bad that it was almost unbearable to watch,the acting was n't very good either and the script was so bad
1,in the meantime it 's a very good one,in a movie of which the audience is constantly left
1,or perhaps the best part of the film was when the two guys,or maybe a little more of a movie than a horror film
1,the only real problem i had with it was,the film is set in a time warp
1,all of the actors have done their best work,all the characters are so likable and lovable
1,it 's a shame it 's not available in dvd format,it is n't as good as the first one but it is
1,for a long while they are not in a bad state of acting and the script,for some reason a character was born to play the part of a young boy
1,its not as good as some other films but it 's a fun one,its so obvious that the movie itself is a little slow in the extreme but
1,it 's not the best film of 2001 it is n't bad it 's not a good,it was a great movie with a great cast great actors and a good story line
1,i have to admit i was n't a bit surprised when it was in my mind and i think the reason i wanted to,i do remember that i was watching this movie with a very open mind but i was still surprised when i watched it
1,it is the same old film that we have been watching on the big screen,it 's a movie that is so stupid you ca n't take your eyes off the
1,so why would anyone like this one,so if you want to laugh out loud
1,and it 's not the only other film that can be made available,and that 's what you 'll get from a very funny scene
1,pacing is also good but that the movie is n't really a good one,pacing is not bad but the script is so bad that it 's difficult to
1,howard 's character is so stupid as,howard is a very talented actor
1,some of the other performances are pretty good,some parts of the movie are just a waste
1,you know it is the worst movie of the 90 's,you know the movie was shot with a camera camera but it
1,the only thing i can say about this movie is,the only thing missing in it is the acting
1,well this is not a movie that will appeal to all ages in the,well the movie is not very good or even a little too long
1,have you ever heard of this movie,have no one to do with him
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the acting and the acting,the movie does n't seem to have much depth or atmosphere to it
1,the acting is good the story is very,the acting in it is pretty bad
1,on the other hand there is some interesting dialogue and a bit of romance and some good acting,on a whole it 's a good film with good performances by the cast and the acting is all
1,the first part of this film was so,the plot was a bit too thin
1,i was surprised to find out this was not a,i think it 's a great movie to watch
1,there are many things that make it interesting to say,there is a lot of gore in this movie
1,i'm sorry but this film does n't even,i'm sorry it did not get better
1,in the end we never really get to see the characters in this movie,in my opinion the only thing good about the film is the acting which is
1,we all know that this is a great film and we have to be seen,we have a group of people who are trying to escape from a nuclear bomb
1,we see him in a small role as the conflicted,we 're in a state of confusion and sorrow
1,wow i know that it is an excellent movie but it has to be,wow i do agree with the critics on how good the movie is
1,it is a very good show and it 's definitely fun to watch,it was a bit of an opportunity to get the film right
1,many things were wrong with a good movie,many of the characters are so real that i
1,they should have made the movie a bit better instead,they are the best friends of the entire movie
1,just a few minutes of this film are spent,just a great movie with a good cast
1,the plot is simple and predictable,the film is set against a very
1,i do n't know why the movie did n't make sense to the director 's vision and the director was,i think the main thing i hated most was that the film was a little bit of an accident
1,and the ending was n't bad,and there 's also a very good
1,even when the first one ended i did n't think that any,even a few of the jokes and gags were pretty corny
1,well this one is n't bad at,well it was a great film
1,most of the time it 's not as long as he is in it,most of the time i was n't sure if the director was intended to be
1,while the movie is a bit long it is not a comedy or a thriller,while the story was a bit weak the acting the directing the directing the dialogue and
1,along with the usual suspects the plot is a joke,along with a few others in the cast the cast is
1,the only redeeming quality i can find was that the movie has some good points but it 's not even as bad as the other,the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the fact that the characters are so bad that you do not care about them
1,without the hint of a great actor and a great actress she,without a doubt the most disappointing thing i 've ever seen
1,the film is n't really about as much as the book but it is a good movie,the story is a bit of a bore and the ending does not make sense to the viewer
1,as the movie progresses and the viewer gets to the end of the movie the plot is not a bit contrived,as a child of an ardent fan of the first film i was very surprised when i read the book
1,there were a few good parts of this movie,there is a lot of action in the film but
1,if you want a film to make an attempt at making fun of an american film you must see this film,if you do n't want to get it out of your hands for 90 minutes then do n't bother to waste your
1,bugs and the beanstalk was one of those movies that was,bugs bunny is the best movie i have ever seen
1,i was expecting a lot from the movie but i was surprised,i do n't know if the film is just about two men who
1,it is also a movie that is not only the best of the genre but,it is a great movie with a great cast of characters and great characters
1,watch it with some friends or friends and you,watch this movie if you can find it
1,today it 's not even funny to watch,today the film has been a complete disaster since
1,nonetheless i would n't recommend to anyone who has not seen this movie,nonetheless it is n't really the same as the rest of the series but
1,so many people say it 's a great movie,so i did n't care for her character
1,not much happens in the movie,not to mention the fact that the
1,now i have a lot to say and i'm a fan,now i 'll say that the acting is very good
1,in the end it was just plain awful,in a way i think that the movie is
1,the story is very interesting to the eye and i think it 's very good to have,the only good thing here for me was that they could have made a better movie
1,this is an excellent and very very underrated film,this is one of the best movies in the world
1,in this case the movie is not very good,in a way that 's the way they were
1,other than that the story is a complete mess,other than the fact that the movie is not the
1,if this movie is supposed to be a spoof of a film that is a,if you want to see a very good film this is a must see
1,the first time i saw this movie on tv,the movie is a mess of a movie
1,if you 're not a fan of the comic book or the series 's history you 'll get this show,if you 've never seen a movie you can watch with the kids or a bunch of people who are looking
1,this movie is not a great movie but a good film to me,this is one of those movies that you should n't miss if the film
1,original is the story of a young man and her son as they meet in a mutual struggle in the,original was the only one in the movie where the movie was shot was shot in the back room
1,and i am a fan of the original,and the whole thing has no real meaning
1,but this is what i thought it was a good film and i liked it,but i was a bit surprised to see how the movie was shot and edited and
1,lucio fulci 's direction was very good and,lucio fulci has made a good film
1,well i did not think that this would make any sense,well it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but
1,overall this movie is a waste of your time,overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch but
1,nonetheless this was a pretty decent movie,nonetheless the film is a bit over the
1,it has a lot of problems and it has its moments but overall it is a good movie worth seeing and i would recommend it,it 's an interesting film and the acting by the cast is superb and i think that it was a great film to watch
1,as an actor it seems like a real person 's performance,as a child this movie has a nice sense of humor and
1,if they 're going to get out of the way they are all over the place in the middle when,if you are a big fan of the books and liked the original then you should definitely be disappointed
1,it was a nice idea but not a good one,it 's just a shame it is n't a sequel
1,actually the movie is a bit too predictable for the whole family but,actually there is an excellent amount of time to see the film
1,the story is a bit confusing and predictable but the film 's ending is very abrupt,the plot and acting are terrible the plot is stupid the acting is horrible and the story
1,neither the director or the writer intended to make the movie any,neither of them was so much better as in the original
1,thanks to that i can see the film 's flaws as a child 's film,thanks to his best friend he has been able to get a lot of money from
1,no wonder i saw this film when i was,no one has a good sense of humor
1,although the acting was good it was a good movie,although the film has a great cast the film is a
1,it is the story that makes the film so much more enjoyable than any other film that has had in,it is a movie that has been told and appreciated by many others who have seen the first one
1,the story is very similar to what happened on this one,the story revolves around a group of young teens and their own
1,i was n't even going to be able to relate to the characters and plot,i 've never been a big fan of hers but it 's a shame that it
1,lindy is an actress who gets a job and,lindy and the others are the same characters
1,the script is full of cliches and the ending is a complete copout,the movie is about a young girl who goes to the island to visit
1,i'm not sure how to describe that but it is n't,i'm glad that the dvd release is available for purchase on vhs
1,this movie is about a woman who is,this is the worst of the bunch
1,the movie starts when the first one is going to be a bit like the one that is supposed to show,the story is very well told and the movie moves forward as a whole not to make a great thriller
1,i have a soft spot for these two actors who,i was n't really looking forward to the movie
1,flklypa is a great film for a long time,flklypa and behold i have to wonder how this got
1,whats it all that is happening to me,whats a bit unfair for this movie but if
1,where does that sound of the camera zoom,where the heck did i get a dvd that
1,why does this film have to be so bad,why do you have to see the movie
1,however the movie also has some good points of view and some of the scenes are very exciting,however i have to agree that it was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,there is nothing wrong with the fact that it is a movie about how it could be done,there was a lot of violence in the film which was pretty good and a nice touch of the
1,he was just the right man for his role in this movie,he 's a bit of an egotistical idiot but his wife is not
1,firstly the script is very weak and,firstly this is a bad film
1,the movie is just a mess,the story and characters are so complex
1,it was a great movie and i liked that one too,it 's not as simple as the other films but that 's
1,it 's the same type of movie you get from the,it 's a real pity that such a good movie
1,in the movie 's defense and to a lesser extent it is an easy task that he does n't seem to know that his wife is not a true person and that he has been killed in his own life,in the meantime he is in the middle ages of a movie with an almost mystical music score by john woo but the film 's only saving grace is not necessarily that the film is set in the near future and
1,the movie is also a great movie for the kids and the kids,the script has a few twists and turns but it has the best part
1,the script is a little thin as well and that 's not enough to get the viewer to empathise with them,the acting is very poor and it is a pity that the actors are n't given enough credit to any of the
1,although the first time i watched this movie the first time i was so scared and bored i thought,although a few years later it 's still a nice surprise to be able to sit through this
1,was the film a good idea or a movie,was there anything to do with the production of the
1,well it did and it 's a bit,well the first one was a classic
1,but the movie is a very bad movie and it is not worth watching the film for,but it is a film that makes it all the more difficult to understand and it 's very
1,but i ca n't imagine the last one of the,but the film is just a bit too long
1,as for the story it 's not a good idea,as for the movie it was a little too long but
1,i have to wonder if this one is a little overrated,i was a little surprised that the filmmakers had a lot of
1,no wonder this film was made in the us,no wonder he was not the best man
1,if this was one of the best parts of the book they would be the best,if the story had been done by a group of friends and told the story of the
1,he 's got a lot of fun and it has all the right ingredients that are present in his,he 's a man with no brains no good sense of humor and he 's just so bad
1,i was hoping that some people might find a movie that is so stupid it 's almost painful to watch,i would have given it 2 stars but even for a little more of the same type of film i would
1,the film was shot on a very small budget,the plot is a little confusing but the acting is
1,plus it is so bad that it,plus the acting is very weak
1,the movie has a good cast and a,the first half is a little slow
1,a movie that will never be forgotten,a good film is a good example
1,clues like the one where they have been,clues are revealed and the movie ends
1,i have never been there for anything else that has,i am so glad i saw it at all
1,the film is a very good thriller and it 's a shame that the film does n't have a lot,the story line is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible to believe it was actually made on the spot
1,i'm a big fan of movies like this one,i'm surprised that this is still one of the worst
1,where the hell does the man and his,where the hell does that come from
1,this is a movie you will watch with your friends and,this is not a movie it 's a bad movie
1,also the film is so bad it 's funny,also it 's not even a movie it is a
1,in this film we are shown a couple times the film is not very long and it seems the director and actors are trying to make up a lot of,in fact if you 're a fan of his work and the original movie you should see the film and enjoy his performance as one of the main characters
1,i have n't read the book and i do,i 've seen better stuff in my career
1,there 's a lot of action,there were some good parts of the
1,in the end you get to see the film 's climax in the last 20 minutes of the film,in this movie they have a great cast and it 's the kind of story that makes it worth your
1,robin williams plays the part as a tough guy and,robin hood is a perfect choice for the movie
1,spanish horror films are always the case,spanish cinema should be required viewing
1,the acting is so bad it boggles the mind that the,the story is simple and the acting is pretty good
1,this movie has the best performance of all times,this is a movie you will love it
1,really the movie 's biggest asset is,really it 's not that bad
1,it 's a very simple film with an extremely strong ending,it 's a very funny movie and a funny one
1,jet li is great as his longsuffering sidekick,jet li is one of the most underrated actors
1,all that was said about this film is that it has the same amount of,all that was left was a big budget that made me cry so much
1,or the way she is treated to the movie,or the other way it does not work
1,i would recommend this show to anyone who,i do n't know who 's who
1,the film is a bit too slow for me,the story line is not bad but the acting is
1,thank you to the dvd player of the film and the movie,thank god he did n't have to go to the gym
1,i think this movie is a must see,i am so glad that you can find this
1,what makes this film a classic is,what 's the point of that
1,after the first two films i 've seen this movie as a very bad movie it has been done before,after the first hour you 're just waiting for some kind of reason why this film has a cult following
1,with a little of the same old style and a bit more of a lot of people who have been,with the exception of a great director who 's the director 's best work he 's also very funny
1,after a while the only thing good about the film is the soundtrack,after the death of his friend and his wife and her son they are
1,the only way it has a movie can be to get the audience to think is the way the people that,the movie also shows the struggle between the two and the other and is n't as funny as its predecessor
1,we have seen the first two films,we 're supposed to be scared by a
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful the script,the movie does not have to be so bad
1,this is a great family movie that will never,this movie was so much better than this
1,a very good and interesting movie from the director,a very simple movie with a few laughs but the
1,it is n't that i do n't know it 's not so bad i,it 's a movie you can take over but not in a hurry
1,well the film is about a guy with a heart who is a little too infatuated with,well this is the only movie that i have ever seen that 's better than this
1,the only real problem is that the film 's story is not interesting,the story is n't that bad but the script is awful and the acting
1,this one was n't bad but not the best of the two,this is one of the best films of the year and one of
1,in the end the story is so predictable that i felt cheated by having wasted time watching this,in the film the viewer gets to see the whole thing and then it becomes a lot more than
1,if you do n't want to see the movie then you can see it in the theater,if you are in a league of a film that has a lot of good things going for
1,you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of its plot,you know you 're in trouble when you are in a situation
1,there are a bunch of other actors that are,there is a lot of violence and nudity
1,i do n't think that the actors were in,i was really surprised when the credits rolled
1,too many people in this country and people were afraid that this is the same story,too bad that this movie has a lot of flaws but is the story to tell that
1,the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder what the hell was going on,the only redeeming feature that is good was the scene where the girl of the movie confronts
1,please avoid this unless it was n't for the first half of the movie,please if you are looking for a good story that has some good acting great
1,pretty much every time i see it i have to,pretty well acted and acted by the same director
1,quaid 's character was the most interesting character i 've seen,quaid and his brother are the same as in the first film
1,this is not one of those movies that you ca n't take seriously,this movie could be seen at least one hundred times before the credits roll
1,anyway the movie is very well acted,anyway there 's a scene of a woman
1,this is the worst film i have,this movie is not a masterpiece
1,my friend 's father was a very conservative and caring person and he was a little confused and confused,my only question is why did he keep putting him on a show in order to make a movie that
1,he has done the film with an excellent,he is also very very convincing here
1,the script is not very well written and does n't work in a movie about the story itself and instead it is very,the film has a very good plot line and some of the actors are excellent and the plot is a bit farfetched
1,i was expecting a lot from it but i really liked it,i think the movie is a total disaster and i think they are

1,she is a great actress and that she has,she 's an actress in a long time
1,the story is about a young man who goes through the streets of the town,the film is a little bit of a downer for those who want to laugh at
1,such as the fact that they are both so close and the film,such a shame that i do n't have a problem with that
1,interestingly enough it was a movie made in the early 90s so it had the potential of,interestingly enough the film does have a few moments but overall the film is pretty dull
1,make a great movie about the dangers,make no mistake for the film
1,the movie has been done by an,the acting is n't bad either
1,but i ca n't help but feel like i 've been trying,but i did n't see the film until the very end
1,bret sorvino has the best role,bret brooks is great in the role

1,he 's a great actor and it 's easy to say that,he is n't the only person who can save his life
1,creative and interesting the film has a few funny moments,creative film that was made for its release of the first
1,since i was not in the mood for more i was n't impressed,since he 's not a very good actor he is very very good here
1,as far as i'm concerned i was looking forward to this,as a result a movie of the week has been released in
1,special mention should go to show a lot of,special mention is the performance of the actress
1,but i have to say it 's one of the worst movies in my opinion,but this is a great movie with a great cast and an excellent story and it
1,but the best parts are the one where the girl is talking about how she,but the real star is the fact that he has a very small part
1,how many of us have seen this,how many times do you go
1,the story of the movie and the way it unfolds,the story was pretty good and the actors and crew were
1,hermione 's father is an excellent actor and it 's very surprising to see how he could have done his,hermione 's character 's character was n't very funny at all but it still seemed to have been funny
1,he plays the role of a lifetime,he is the first to die
1,what i did like was the fact that the character 's motivations were,what i found was a good story and i liked the characters
1,scene of course is a classic,scene is the scene in which the
1,movie is about a man who is trying,movie is one of my alltime favorites
1,after that it has been released on video as soon as a dvd release of,after all the first time you see the trailer it is a good movie
1,yet the film does have its share of problems and some,yet it never seems to be a film or drama
1,snarky but this one is just a little more than a few of the best movies,snarky little kid is a good show with some nice laughs and some great performances
1,i would n't be surprised if the movie was n't so much fun,i have to wonder when it 's available on dvd or the dvd version
1,i would n't want to be a fan of the original,i am amazed at how this movie got released theatrically
1,he also wrote some of the most,he is an extremely talented actor
1,the movie is about the love of the family and it is,the acting ranges from a very good performance to the actors
1,a few years ago i was able to see,a lot of the movie is about sex
1,another example of the film in the last twenty years is the fact that the movie is not a comedy at all and that it 's a movie,another thing that i did n't like was the way it was portrayed as the film 's plot is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,and the movie is a little dated,and the movie is a bit of a
1,the story and acting are all very good,the movie is about a man who is a
1,to say that there was no plot in the original movie is the best part of the film,to make matters worse this guy is a total moron and is just as stupid as the rest of
1,i think i 've just read the comments and seen the,i was very impressed with the way the movie ended
1,for a film i would n't even consider the movie to be a bit boring it was quite a bit slow paced and at times downright unbelievable,for the sake of the film you will be pleasantly surprised by the fact that it is based upon a book by a man who was not a
1,the film does contain several interviews with various subjects in which a couple of characters do exist,the film is a bit of a bore but the ending is pretty good as well
1,not the worst movie i 've ever seen,not only did the movie not get its budget
1,paz vega does a good job playing her,paz lewis is one of the best
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who go to prison to investigate the mystery of their lives,the only real standout was to make you feel like you were in for a fun time and a fun
1,stan 's dad is a real person who is the,stan laurel was in a coma with the family
1,the first part of the film is quite a bit of a surprise,the story is about a man who has an addiction to her family and
1,the film has some good points and some really good sequences and some nice,the movie was so good that it made me feel good about it
1,stilted script and poor performances from the two leads make it hard to get into the plot the plot and the plot,stilted and dull but the film is a great piece of work and i recommend it to any fan of classic horror
1,this movie is so stupid you ca n't take a joke seriously,this film has been done by the other three yearolds of all ages
1,the only thing that i do n't say is that it is a good story,the only good thing that could happen is the movie is not so much as a
1,so i did n't get much of the movie,so what i did n't understand the film was a
1,i have been watching the movie dozens of times and now i'm glad i did n't,i would n't be interested if the story of a young woman who had a dream with
1,it 's a real shame because the story is so bad it 's almost laughable,it 's the same kind of movie that 's the reason the first one is so
1,i have to admit i love this movie but that is the only thing that makes this so bad that this movie is so bad,i think he 's a great director who could have done a better job and his work in that the script is very good
1,the acting was good and the acting was excellent,the plot is pretty lame as is the acting
1,many of the scenes are so boring they 're just funny in their parts,many of these films made for the sake of being the worst movie ever made
1,as a matter of fact it is a little dated,as the film goes on it is very clear that he
1,however the movie has some good points,however it 's not the only way to
1,watch it and then you 'll see it,watch it for yourself to find out
1,you do n't have to be a big fan of either of these films to make,you can read that the movie is about as much a drama as the original
1,when the two men are killed in the dark their relationship with each other is revealed by the viewer 's intelligence,when a woman is murdered she is forced to take the money and the family 's daughter to the home of her
1,pope and wife are a married couple,pope is a very very good actor who
1,i was expecting to see some of the worst parts of this movie but it 's still worth watching,i 've seen a lot of bad movies but this one is so bad that it 's actually painful to
1,the movie has a great cast and an excellent story,the plot is pretty weak and it 's hard to believe
1,some of the other reviews have stated how to say this movie is very well made,some may disagree with the movie and not even that of those who have commented on this
1,it is a pity that this film has not been released commercially in dvd,it 's an excellent performance and i would definitely recommend this movie to everyone
1,in the first movie he 's a good guy and i,in the end he is the hero of a crime
1,geer 's character is not only sympathetic and the film is a mess that is so utterly devoid of,geer and his crew were a little too old for the role the director had no clue of
1,this movie was so bad that i was laughing my pants off,this is a film that should have been shown on a larger budget
1,a few of my friends were born in their own home and,a good film that should be seen by many other actors
1,contrast in the end of my life of the movie is the story of the life of,contrast between the two main characters in the series the first season was a real stinker
1,from this period of time you will see a very good cast of characters including john carradine and david lynch as a young,from the opening scene of the film the viewer is left wondering how it will end up with such a great film
1,van heflin is the most memorable and most talented actor in the film,van damme was one of the most underrated stars of the last years
1,it was a little more of a parody than anything else but it was a good film for the,it 's a shame because i have a hard time figuring out what i saw on this film
1,you have to be a big fan of movies to enjoy,you know the drill is coming from the first movie
1,this movie is a must see,this movie is a waste of time
1,but i have no idea what to expect from this film except for the fact that it has,but the movie was a total disappointment and i really did n't care about any of it
1,our hero is a very likable character,our heroine has to be one of his
1,he 's a good actress and is also very good in the role as well,he plays a young man who 's hired to be a gangster in the united states
1,can anyone make a movie that 's so bad you 're,can you imagine the director 's commentary on the film
1,the plot line was so stupid the plot was ridiculous the acting was mediocre,the plot line is very simple and the characters are believable and believable
1,the only redeeming feature about this movie is it 's not the most,the film is a bit long but it has it 's flaws
1,giving this movie an award i will give it a 1010,giving the film a little more credit to the characters and their
1,likable and entertaining in this regard,likable and very funny but not in
1,not that it is a little dated but it does have a great deal of atmosphere,not that there is any need of a good movie to make the audience care
1,i have a lot of respect for this and i'm going to say that this is a good movie,i was n't disappointed when a film was adapted from a novel but it 's not even a movie
1,he does n't want to get out of his house but he is forced to go to,he has a few lines which is not the most important thing i have ever heard
1,the story was good but it was n't as good as the,the acting was horrible and the plot was just too bad
1,you 're supposed to feel bad for,you do n't need the same
1,you could not have made a movie of this kind,you do n't get to see any of the characters or
1,mascaro 's story is about a killer who kills the girl and,mascaro is the most famous film that i 've ever seen
1,the film has a very nice touch that i think is an excellent movie,the movie is also a lot of fun to watch and i would say that
1,this movie is a real treasure in the lives of,this movie is the worst i have ever seen
1,instead she is a young lady and her husband is a very young woman who loves her,instead he goes into the house to get his revenge against the evil and the man 's father
1,the only real highlight of the movie is its,the story itself seems like a bad idea
1,after watching the film for the first time i was really surprised,after the first five minutes i felt like i was watching a documentary
1,i saw this movie in the theater in the theater and was so impressed by how bad it was,i have never been so compelled to see this film again and i ca n't even get to the one
1,i would say it 's a movie that is not even,i do n't understand how it was going to end
1,in addition to the acting it 's a great movie,in the end it 's a little bit more than a
1,it has a very very bad soundtrack,it is n't even a movie
1,the plot is a little weak but it is still entertaining enough to keep my attention,the acting was pretty good the story lines were very good but the acting was horrible
1,aristocrat 's son is the most annoying character that i,aristocrat and his men are also in the movie
1,so much of the film is set in an,so i am not surprised it is n't
1,the film is a little too long,the plot revolves around a group of teenagers
1,kelsey is a good actor but the rest of,kelsey 's father is a little too young
1,this was an insult to all the,this movie is just plain boring
1,and then i was in a state of awe for the characters and the plot,and the ending was so abrupt and the movie was so confusing that i felt compelled
1,and the whole thing has a few funny moments that just make you laugh,and if you do n't care about the characters the plot is so ridiculous you
1,if that were what i 'd call it a comedy and i was,if you want to see this movie you should definitely enjoy it
1,reviewers who have seen it do n't think i 'd want to know,reviewers who are looking for something good is n't very very good
1,i have been in high school in the past,i 've always been a fan of a movie and
1,marjorie dee is one of my favorite actors but the script is not as good as it should be,marjorie dee and michael jayston are great and it 's all very well cast as they have done so well
1,lol i do n't know if it 's a bad script and just about everyone involved in the making of it,lol it 's a great movie that will be forgotten at least for a few generations and the fact that you can
1,as the film goes on we see the two of them in a different world,as a result the movie was pretty bad the acting was awful the story was awful
1,i have to say that i have not read any of the other reviews here i,i 've seen a lot of films with a lot of good actors in it
1,this movie was n't so bad it was,this movie is not worth your time
1,the film 's only redeeming feature is the acting by a very young nicolas cage,the story of the girl who lives in the apartment building is an interesting one
1,very few films have a good plot,very little to say but that 's not
1,harold 's character and his father are all a tad underdeveloped at times,harold is just as funny in this movie and he 's really funny
1,long live the first of the three films,long before the film was released i found the
1,scorsese 's first film is an adaptation of his classic novel 'the omega man',scorsese has to do that to make a movie that 's not the first one
1,for the most part i thought that it was pretty good but i liked,for example when they were shot the movie was n't a complete failure
1,and i really liked this movie,and if you want to watch the
1,tom hanks is the one to blame the film for its shortcomings,tom selleck 's portrayal of mr darcy is one of the most powerful
1,it is a very simple story of a young woman who travels across europe,it was a good movie that i would like for anyone to enjoy
1,custer was the most prolific character in the film who was the hero of the show,custer is in love with a man who is in love with the woman who is engaged
1,and the scene where they 're shot is a joke,and the ending is the one in the movie with a
1,even in an attempt to explain the movie 's flaws it was just a complete,even though it is n't as bad as you might find yourself watching it
1,if you like it or hate your kids then you 'll be in the minority for the rest of,if it had been a movie it is a great movie with the best acting job of all
1,as the movie progressed we were treated to the characters we see and we never see anything that,as i recall it was so bad that i could n't even remember any of the characters
1,jack palance is excellent here as a villain,jack 's brother is not an easy target for
1,granted the movie was pretty bad but it was not that,granted the film is a bit too much for me
1,and the movie 's plot is about how much,and then the whole movie just gets worse
1,oh and i was so disappointed that i could,oh yea i was n't really a kid
1,i have n't seen it since the first time i watch,i was surprised that this film would be a flop
1,i would n't recommend this movie to any people who can,i have been waiting for a movie to be better
1,beyond that the film has no redeeming qualities to the film,beyond all the script is not the best i 've ever seen
1,i have n't seen this movie in a long time,i saw this on cable tv at a preview store
1,sets are the main problem with this film,sets in a town that will make you want
1,it seems that the filmmakers have been making a good film and have some very good,it 's a shame he was n't in the movie for more than five seconds
1,anyway if you are not into this movie do n't bother with,anyway i do n't understand why people are not so popular
1,he 's not a big fat jerk and a lot of the movie 's charm,he is a good actor and he is not in it for his role
1,considering the fact that the director had the audacity to create a movie which,considering the subject matter i would have given it the vote higher rating
1,the acting is terrible the script is horrible the direction is bad the editing is horrible,the film is a bit long but it is not too much of a drama and a
1,a lot of the dialogue is so stupid it 's almost comical,a lot of this film is just as good as the book
1,i think that was what happened in the first film,i have no problem with the fact of this movie being
1,granted this movie has some of the most hilarious moments i 've ever witnessed,granted it 's a pretty cool film but it is very very bad
1,the plot is so bad the acting is worse the script is terrible and,the only good thing is that there is n't a lot to recommend
1,this film is a must see,this is a film of a film
1,could n't they have been a bit cranky and,could have been done in a good hurry
1,i am not a fan of the original series and this is one of the best,i do n't think that a person could possibly enjoy this movie as a comedy but it
1,i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked to see the movie,i have seen this movie in the past several years and i was
1,but it 's also an enjoyable show,but i have never forgotten a movie like
1,the movie is a little over the top and it has the usual suspects that are the main points of,the plot is simple and the characters are so boring that it makes for a good film to watch
1,it 's not the worst i 've seen in a long time,it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
1,somehow it was just another case of the original,somehow the film itself is quite slow and the pace
1,what we get to see is a bit of a puzzle,what 's more the film is just a piece of crap
1,overall i would recommend this movie to all,overall a very good show to watch
1,the film is a bit of a mess but as a whole this,the film 's climax is a classic as the story unfolds slowly
1,and the film is so bad that it makes the whole movie feel like a student movie,and there is no plot or plot development and the whole film seems forced to lose some spark
1,it was a complete waste of time,it is not a film that i would
1,it 's a shame that the director never made more,it is n't even funny enough to be funny
1,is it that a bunch of scientists who,is n't it that good or bad
1,but that 's what this film does and is one of the best,but the movie is so poorly constructed that it 's hard to understand why
1,blanca has an excellent ability of making her character believable and believable,blanca and emma were the most likable characters in the movie
1,he is a great artist and he 's a good,he also is a great actor in this film
1,the story is about a girl who gets her husband to go after her,the film is about a man who gets a job of a job in the
1,one of the most beautiful scenes of the film,one of the most beautiful movies ever made
1,jackson was also in the cast and was very effective in the movie,jackson has a great voice but he is not the same actor
1,the movie is just about a group of teenagers who want to live in a,the film 's plot is so thin that you 'll never see the ending
1,i think this is one of the most enjoyable films of,i saw this film in the theater in my memory
1,the plot is a lot of holes and is n't worth watching,the story is simple the actors are all very good and the story
1,take the scene at the airport when the guy says oh god i ca n't say,take this movie and make the movie as good as you can get it right
1,i'm sure that the filmmakers were n't paying money to make,i'm not even sure what to say about this show
1,this is a great movie with a message that the director of photography was very interested in,this is the only movie i have seen from the first film with that kind of humour
1,this film has the feel of a tv show and the acting,this film is not only for the fans of the genre
1,well i think the best part of this movie was the music which was very nice,well you have to see it to understand what 's going on in the film
1,the only thing this film had going for it was the acting the,the movie also suffers from a very poor script and bad acting
1,bozz 's mother is a woman in paris,bozz is a former cop who is sent to
1,many of the other reviews here have criticized this show and i have no complaints of the people involved with the show i do n't understand,many of my friends think that i would have been in the same class of a movie as the worst of them and i do n't even
1,but the movie is n't bad,but the rest of the cast are
1,the only reason i watched it is because it 's a comedy and as a comedy it is a must,the story is a little thin for a thriller but i think it 's a very important thing to follow
1,once a year is n't all this is,once again this was a great movie
1,if you 're looking for a movie with a good plot a good acting and a good plot then this movie is for you and for,if you want to see a movie that does n't make you think you want to see the first one you need to watch it
1,what 's more interesting is how the writers have managed to build the story and make them,what 's so bad about this film is that it 's not even a bad movie
1,the only thing good about this is the fact that,the movie is a little bit of a thriller
1,it is one of my favorites,it is one of the worst films
1,at the end i was surprised by the ending and i was n't really expecting,at first i do n't know why this movie flopped in the first place
1,to be honest i was surprised to hear,to be fair the story is simple
1,if you have not read the book you 'll be disappointed,if you have n't seen this movie you can see why
1,the story is about a bunch of four friends who want the two to get,the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable it 's almost laughable
1,that is what the whole movie is,that 's the way i feel
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this is a very poor attempt to recreate the world
1,this is not your typical bollywood film but it is a real treat in its depiction of the life of people of the time,this is not an excellent film but its good to see how it 's in the works of the great director and the director and
1,when i saw this film it would make my eyes bleed,when i saw it i had to see it again after it
1,the first one was a bit more enjoyable,the acting is n't bad the script is n't
1,in one of the most ridiculous films ever made it 's a very bad film and it 's not even the,in the movie the actors are not the same as the one who did the same thing in the movie
1,it 's like they are watching something that 's not even funny,it 's like a movie that was supposed to be made with the
1,the plot is pretty good the acting was pretty,the acting of the leads is very good
1,that is n't a bad thing because this show,that would n't be too hard to explain
1,yes the plot is a little convoluted,yes it does have the typical elements of
1,this film was not so well written and acted,this is one of those films that i have not
1,instead we get a very lame plot and a few characters that are not,instead the movie is set in the future of the early 20th century
1,this is one of the worst films i,this is the worst movie of 2008
1,the acting of the main leads and the story is just a mess,the movie is a bit of an attempt at making a movie
1,what 's more the most interesting aspect of the film is how,what i did like was this movie 's a good thing
1,better still a film that could have easily passed away,better yet not as much as it could have been
1,i was expecting more from him,i was n't expecting this movie to
1,more importantly it 's a film that does n't have to be a thriller or an adult movie that is a good one to,more than a little a bit of an insult to me i could have cared for a few characters but they were not
1,nobody should know what to expect from the other members of,nobody has a clue what the movie was really about
1,he is one of the funniest characters in the film,he is n't the best man on the planet
1,gong li was a good choice and i have to,gong li is the best character in this movie
1,this film is the most beautiful film i have ever seen,this film is so awful that it could n't even make it
1,the movie is about a group of people who are sent to a planet to search for,the only reason to see the movie is because the director wanted to do the film
1,why did n't they just make a movie,why did they just make the movie
1,that 's why this film is so much of a surprise that it has a,that 's a shame because the film 's only redeeming feature is the music
1,otherwise it 's not that bad,otherwise a film that should be viewed
1,if you 're going to give this movie a go it 'll be,if you have n't seen this film you 'll probably be disappointed
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't understand why they made this movie,there 's no denying that this was supposed to be a comedy but it 's a little too serious
1,the film has some good points but is so,the acting in my opinion is very good
1,where the film is the best thing you can say about,where is it that is n't explained in any way
1,nobody is even remotely sympathetic to the movie,nobody knows where this movie came from but it
1,victor has never been a great actor in the past few years,victor mclaglen plays a young man who is assigned to become an international
1,everybody has a very funny scene,everybody else is a little weak and
1,the movie was very good in this one and it 's a shame the,the movie starts out as though he 's trying to solve a crime
1,i have no doubt that i would be more than willing to go out and see this film but i do,i think the film was a little too long for me because of its technical content and a great cast
1,as for that i found that the movie was very funny and was,as far as i can tell it is not even a film
1,people like the movie 's plot were very very stupid,people who have been in the military and the media has
1,the plot is simple and the film is a mess,the film is set in the future of the early 1950
1,but there 's a lot of the same thing in the movie,but the movie was not about the war of the world
1,but there are also some really great moments,but then he 's still trying to get rid
1,even the actors are not bad and the movie lacks any of it,even if this movie did a good job of portraying the characters in general
1,yeah the plot is n't that funny anymore,yeah i 've heard it was n't so bad
1,harry callahan is one of our favorite movies,harry is in this movie he plays an american
1,john goodman plays an annoying man who wants to be an american,john wayne 's first film appearance as the director of the movie did
1,however the movie is n't as bad as it should have been,however the story of the girl is quite interesting and it 's not
1,in the end the story is a little confusing and is n't funny,in the end it is not worth seeing the film as it does n't
