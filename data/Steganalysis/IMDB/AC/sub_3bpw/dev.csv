0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

1,this is one of the best movies i have seen
1,really bad film with bad acting
1,alright it 's not as bad as the others but it is good enough
1,the movie was a very bad attempt to make an action movie
1,kris kristofferson was very good in this film he was a
1,so the movie is a waste of time as a whole
1,the script was good the acting was bad and the whole plot line
1,this is a very funny movie
1,the movie is not very funny
1,they should n't be in the same hurry that
1,if there were more than two people involved in it i think i 'd have been better off watching the
1,the story is simple but the plot
1,i 've seen a bit worse and worse
1,the only redeeming factor of this movie was the music
1,the movie has its own unique plot
1,i have no idea where i can buy this movie
1,what 's the appeal of this
1,all the other characters seem to have the same personality and their motivations are very believable and it is hard for him to
1,then there 's the ending where you do n't have to be
1,has this movie been released theatrically in english
1,dull and boring and i did not know that there
1,the film is very well done
1,i would n't call this a great movie but i think its one of the
1,a very entertaining film that is n't a
1,rollin is not a very good director
1,there are so many good lines in the whole movie the story has to be told
1,it 's a pity that this was not available to
1,and that 's not the best part of the film
1,i saw it again and i loved it
1,going to see a movie of that type that it 's a bit too late but a lot of
1,the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack
1,so it 's a little hard to get past the fact that it has a very simple ending but that 's what is so important about
1,with a little more work i have the feeling that the director is trying to recreate the film in his own way
1,maybe they should be making it up a bit better
1,scarlett 's husband and the son 's father died and the father is killed
1,d the first time i watched this film it was the same movie in the first
1,feels like a good thing is the fact that it is n't a comedy
1,most of this film takes place during the war and the story is about a young boy who is sent to prison
1,it 's all about sex and violence
1,doug nolte is the only one who seems to be able to
1,and there is some good stuff in the movie which
1,how could a movie like this come out
1,on the one hand there is no denying the importance of the story of the characters and the characters
1,corey haim plays a bad man with an iq of the head
1,my only concern was that it did not work for me
1,but the story is about a young man
1,i 've seen the movie and i can safely say i did n't know how
1,at first i thought the movie was a complete rip together but i did n't like it at all
1,its so bad that it 's almost funny
1,this time the director has tried hard to tell his story but it never gets boring
1,this is a pretty good movie
1,to me it 's all about the fact
1,this was a great film for a long time
1,unfortunately this is n't one of those films
1,a good film is a movie about the evils of life and how they are affected by a group of women
1,and the ending where it is n't really a surprise ending is what
1,technically this film is n't a total waste
1,i think it 's the best of the three versions
1,i think that the best part is when the two are talking about each other and the scene
1,i do n't think that the director should have been allowed to be in the film and the film would be a bit
1,the movie has the same basic plot as the book
1,forgotten is the most important film in the
1,anytime it did n't make sense and it did n't seem like they were
1,this is an excellent piece of work
1,some of the scenes were a bit slow but the ending was
1,this is a pretty funny movie but not very funny
1,in a film i do n't care about the plight of a person who is the only reason
1,in fact it 's not just a film that it will be
1,what makes the original so good is the fact
1,i would n't have bothered to see this film for the first time
1,let me explain my feelings about this film the acting is so bad it made
1,in short if i were to make a choice for this film i would have given it a lower rating
1,like most movies about a serial killer that is n't a horror movie and a horror movie this one is very gory but i
1,in fact there are some scenes of that film which is so sad and so obvious that it 's almost impossible to make a film of this vintage film
1,and i think the film was so funny
1,being able to locate the evil killer who is a werewolf in the book is quite good
1,please do not waste your time on this movie
1,these are the two adjectives you can see
1,whenever i first heard about this film i thought oh it was n't a good film
1,nacho 's performance is not bad
1,rosario dawson is a good actress
1,i'm afraid to get a little of what it 's worth but
1,nothing like this was a waste of
1,billed as a movie about a boy 's life the movie
1,it 's a pity that the makers of this movie did n't make this film because
1,one day a young woman comes into the woods
1,in short it 's pretty funny
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was a complete waste of time
1,in a sense of realism it is hard to believe that this was the same story
1,other than that the plot is very weak
1,but i was n't really impressed with
1,it is a film that i think that it 's the greatest thing about the movie
1,it 's not the best but it is n't a good film
1,first let me start off by saying that
1,i think the problem is that the film is a real
1,you know what 's going to happen
1,the only thing i found interesting is that it had the potential
1,this film does n't do it any favours
1,it 's a shame because it is a movie with no pretensions
1,as far as the film 's technical features go this is one of the best of the silent era
1,as i have mentioned before the beginning of the
1,i think the reason why i give the movie a 1 is because of its lack
1,i do think the film is worth watching if you
1,but it was just a little too short
1,like all the other reviews here i have a sense of humor and humor
1,big budget movies are the same
1,as a result the film is just plain bad and i do n't
1,do you think that this movie was
1,i think it was made in new york
1,the first time he saw a woman was in the car i wanted to see him in the shower
1,two men are killed by the ghost hunters
1,my only complaint is that this was the worst movie i have had the pleasure of sitting through
1,i have seen the original version as a child
1,besides the plot and the acting i found myself wishing that the film
1,the film is very much a documentary and the film is not a complete disaster it also has a few moments of humor that are
1,benign is what the film was trying to do
1,during the movie 's climax i felt the need to be a real
1,some of the best movies ever made
1,from start to finish this is a must see
1,i have never seen a movie before but this one was so much more entertaining and more entertaining
1,i have been a fan of his other
1,not much is ever explained in a movie
1,as a child and a fan of the book i have to say that this is one of those films that
1,i do n't think the writer could ever have had his ideas in any way shape
1,filmed in black and white with a lot of people i found this a major disappointment
1,second of all the film 's biggest flaw with the film is its lack of
1,for example i think the film 's director did n't know it to be a comedy
1,wow i do agree with the previous
1,if it were n't for the fact that i could have made this movie to the point
1,the story line has been told and done by several
1,essentially it was a good movie
1,for the love of god do n't bother
1,in this film we get to see what he 's like in her life and how
1,late night on tv was one of the funniest shows i have
1,bon jovi is a very talented actor who is a fine
1,yet they have a very different outlook on the culture of life and life in the past and the life that is in our nation 's
1,you can see this movie in the middle of the movie but it 's not a very good movie either
1,oh and the last one is a great
1,in fact the film was made by a group of friends and they were n't
1,actors are not very bad but they do n't make much sense
1,the plot is simple and the movie
1,still a good movie for fans of classic horror cinema
1,however it 's also the best film i 've ever seen
1,unfortunately i found this movie a bit too much for me
1,a lot of it 's just a little
1,i have seen this movie several times over time
1,and the movie is about a group of teens who
1,mr bean has the best role
1,all of a sudden he 's a jerk who 's not afraid to take a dump and he does n't have a problem
1,this movie has a lot of flaws in it
1,the only reason i did n't give this movie a score was because
1,for me the film is a little slow and dull
1,definitely this film is an insult to the whole cast
1,still the movie was very entertaining and very interesting
1,plus it 's not a good movie
1,are you going to believe that they are
1,characters are never introduced and the plot is a little weak
1,patrick warburton was in the same frame as the first film which was a bit too much
1,you can tell the story behind the story but the
1,bits of violence are shown throughout this flick
1,thanks to the fact that it 's not a horror movie it 's just a cheap cheap
1,coincidentally they were n't in the film for
1,wow the acting is n't bad but that 's all i can really say
1,what a waste of a film
1,basically it 's the fact that it 's not a great film but it is not a great movie
1,it 's not a movie like the
1,it has been done by a few other actors who have n't been in
1,not a bad film but a good movie with an interesting plot
1,this was n't even the worst film i have ever
1,some of the dialogue was so awful that the film was so unfunny to me
1,like the other reviewer mentioned this movie was so bad
1,also the fact that the movie has so many holes in it that it
1,out of my head is the best of the bunch
1,i 've seen some really bad movies but this one is just bad
1,the first one was good the first time
1,the acting is good and the writing are good but not the best
1,it has a couple of good moments and it has some
1,it would have been nice to see more of it and it is very easy to understand why the two were so great as such
1,i have n't laughed at all in many reviews but i still do not enjoy this movie
1,but it 's all a bit too
1,but the real problem is that it seems to
1,the story line was a mess
1,i do n't know what it 's about in the first place but the fact that the film makers have a lot of problems to
1,brother of a wealthy man who 's
1,then there are two different scenes of a story and an unexpected
1,the plot is n't a good idea to begin the series is a bit of a spoof and i think that it was n't a complete waste of time
1,john huston is one of the best actors of his generation
1,there are some good actors in it
1,such a good time capsule of the film is the one that has to be said by the director to be the
1,other than that the film is not even worth a
1,it was n't funny the acting and the direction were so bad and so lame i was so angry that
1,admittedly the movie is a little slow
1,where did the director come from
1,volume 4 is just another example of what 's the easiest film to be
1,this movie is a total waste of my time
1,she is a very beautiful woman
1,that is why the show was so bad
1,the first half of the film concerns a couple of young people and their friends and
1,it 's a shame because the story line is pretty good too
1,things that are n't funny or even mildly funny are the
1,then you get a lot of action that makes you jump out of the car
1,our hero is a cop who 's trying
1,but the film is a bit slow and drags on
1,while the film is not as funny as i expected it to be
1,tired of the time the camera pans and zooms at a snail 's pace
1,while he does n't have to be one of the few characters he is the one
1,therefore there is a lot of things to like
1,alvin is one of those movies that is so bad i do
1,suffice to say that it 's an awesome film
1,vocal score is great and the songs are wonderful
1,it 's not as if he 's trying to do things a bit too much and ends up being
1,the acting is horrible and the writing
1,and it really is one of the best
1,however if you are going to make a
1,and that 's why i gave this movie a 2 out
1,purvis is the only one who has a discernible personality to his face that does n't make
1,if you are a fan of the genre this is a film worth seeing
1,when he was in the movie the first time he had the opportunity to get
1,it 's not a good sign that it is n't as good as the first movie
1,it is one of those movies that makes you
1,it was the first film that i saw on the starz and i was looking up the tv channel in the
1,leland is a young man who gets his revenge on the family and is trying to find a better life
1,why did he keep making a film
1,he is also a good actor who has no talent in the acting department
1,act that was a lot of fun
1,sure there is a lot of violence and there 's a lot
1,of course this was n't the case but it is still the worst
1,in my opinion this is one of the funniest films i have ever seen
1,as for the film 's message it is also a bit overlong
1,then the film starts to end with an abrupt end to the end
1,the story has no plot or character development or plot
1,stars in it were pretty good and it was a pleasure
1,it 's all about the world war ii era in the early days of the film and the story of the president and his wife who is a bit more believable than the usual hollywood movie
1,having just finished watching this one i thought that there was a reason to go ahead to the cinema
1,the film 's plot involves the lives of a man who has been a man to find his family who lost his family
1,in fact if you have to see a movie to watch in a few hours or a few minutes or a little bit of the movie you can get it
1,the film starts off with a young woman named laura who is killed in
1,i am a teenager and i am a great fan of this show
1,oh and do n't forget about it i suppose
1,the only redeeming thing about this film was the music
1,that 's how the movie is so funny
1,tonight the movie is about the man who is a very beautiful person in his
1,and the film was not for me the best part of the film
1,people do not think this movie is a masterpiece of
1,one of the most memorable movies about the holocaust
1,the plot is a bit thin but that 's a good thing
1,what is this with these people
1,red skelton is a fine actor who is not only the greatest comedian in the world but he 's a fine actor
1,it would have been better to have been the focal character of his
1,no one could be better off with such a
1,overall it is worth a look and not a good film
1,the film is set in the present of ireland in
1,this is the only way to make the movie look authentic
1,it 's a real story with a lot of good twists and turns
1,some scenes are not even remotely funny or memorable
1,brain cells was the only good thing about this
1,considering how good it is for a good director and a good cast
1,i 've always been a big fan of the
1,that is the most stupid thing in this movie and this is why the movie is so bad
1,the first time i saw the movie it was the last time
1,little britain is a film that is not just a drama
1,they all get together and they start to get to see the killer in this
1,had the film been made in the us i would have rated it a 2 or 7
1,i would love to see this movie again in the uk but not all the movies in my memory
1,a lot of the movie was shot in the same way
1,not that the film was a bad
1,this is the kind of movie that 's so bad it 's funny
1,shrooms is an excellent movie and the actors who play the
1,he is the only one who has the audacity to be a hero and he is the only
1,and that 's why the film is so bad
1,just to see a film of this caliber
1,all of the actors are great
1,there are many other problems and it is
1,yet there are some very funny moments in the movie
1,unfortunately there is no way to describe the film to
1,at first i did n't like the movie at all
1,a lot of the scenes are so bad you ca n't actually see whats happening to the camera
1,she plays the role of a young and naive mother who is attracted to her
1,they do n't get the point of view or are there
1,i do n't think i 've ever heard of
1,it 's a great movie that is worth
1,the movie has a lot of fun and is very funny
1,the acting in this movie is very good and it
1,of course the film itself was pretty good
1,i am a huge fan of the original series
1,in fact it is a great piece of work
1,about 15 seconds of pure boredom that could 've used the same theme in a different way
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie but the plot was not as good
1,sadly there are some very very good actors involved and the actors are all good
1,charging away from the other side of the tracks is a film that has to be said
1,he does not know it is a lie or a good time and it is not just that he ca n't even get into a car accident
1,elvira is a woman who is a little of the same and is a bit naive
1,i do n't think i could write a review
1,you 're not going to get the
1,in fact the only redeeming qualities of this film are the special effects
1,what the director was able to achieve in this film was the very idea
1,i have seen better acting in a sitcom and in a film that is more of an improvement than an actual movie and a great
1,every character has a different approach to what they have been doing with the help of their
1,that is the case with the movie
1,i was n't surprised how i could not even bother seeing this as the last one to the end
1,they all get a chance to do something different than their prized and friendly father who is the only survivor of
1,over the course of the movie we get a glimpse into how to
1,the acting is horrible the characters is flat and the characters just like the characters
1,the film has a good story and it is not just
1,then there 's the guy that he has the most disgusting of all in a long way
1,the movie is very well acted and the characters are interesting
1,they do n't even try to get it in the first place
1,i have to say that i was so disappointed when i found out that it was
1,the plot is a bit contrived but that 's a good
1,the acting is pretty bad but the plot line is n't bad or the acting the plot and the
1,the story is a bit of a bore and the characters in the movie
1,family guy gets his ass kicked by an arrow in the woods with no real explanation of the killer 's
1,in short there is n't a moment of originality
1,his character is supposed to be funny
1,the film has a nice atmosphere to it but it is n't
1,his performance is a bit stiff and the plot is very thin to say the least but this movie
1,jordan and the gang of brothers and his gang are sent in for a trip to tibet to retrieve the president 's fortune and save a fortune
1,there 's a lot of violence and gore in here and the film does n't have a lot of blood
1,cary grant is a wonderful actor and the supporting cast was great
1,it 's a shame that the writers did n't even have any money
1,when the first episode is finished the series is n't even funny anymore
1,clearly the film 's biggest influence is when the
1,if you like to watch the movie for a long time then
1,how could you have a great film that 's so bad i just ca n't believe how bad it is
1,i was hoping that this would get more recognition and i was disappointed at how awful it was
1,the film opens with the girl 's daughter and her sister 's daughter
1,the acting is very strong and the direction is excellent
1,i was n't sure whether this movie would
1,the movie is so bad that it is hard to make a movie like i was expecting
1,frank sinatra was a very good choice as the lead
1,the acting is very poor and the script is n't really good at all
1,the acting is terrible with poor performances
1,my friend was a great fan
1,the plot is very interesting and i think it 's a bit
1,you 'll know that this is not one of them
1,believe me the story of a girl is a real treat to me a very good movie but
1,they do it on the first time
1,also the scene in the hotel where a woman 's
1,est epatha merkerson has been in a lot of bad movies in her time and she has done an excellent job as well
1,with his wife and son the two become a very human being and the relationship develops between them
1,this movie was one of the best and the most controversial of the genre
1,he is a fine actor but he 's not the only person
1,they are both a very attractive man
1,sadly the director 's intentions are not as compelling as some other reviewers have commented on this film
1,which is the most important aspect of this film it has a very
1,but the story was so good
1,it 's not a bad film but there is
1,there are two main characters in this story and i would
1,the movie is also a bit preachy and the film is
1,a few of my favorites are not very well made in this film
1,or the other guy is in his element of the movie
1,had he been able to get a little more of his money than a movie
1,to me he was a good person
1,i 've read the book on which this movie was
1,they are so much more than i thought
1,my friends and i were in a movie theater with me so much i thought i had to check this one out for free
1,twitchy and a real treat in a movie that is not for everyone who thinks a movie like this should be banned
1,technically the movie is n't a bad movie
1,he is a very good person who is the one to die
1,for those who enjoy this movie the first movie should be a classic for me
1,it has a few good moments
1,the acting is pretty good with some very funny scenes especially
1,the only thing that made this film interesting was that it was made in the seventies
1,prof sam is one of the most annoying characters ever
1,although i 've seen it in several different languages it is still pretty interesting
1,halfway through the movie i realized the film was going to be a little slow but then
1,yet he is the most likable man on
1,but i ca n't say i enjoyed the film it would have been much better
1,but then the movie goes downhill
1,many of my friends have seen this so they 've had it on dvd
1,hell you have to give the movie away
1,all the actors were great and the
1,frustrating in my opinion but in the end
1,first off i must mention that i am so engrossed in the film that i could never get it to
1,yes i know there 's a lot of things to be missing but i can only hope
1,to be fair he is n't the best actor in this movie but he does a pretty good job
1,this film could have been made more and it could have been done much better
1,there is a lot of the movie 's humor
1,not only is the film completely predictable but also the fact that the characters are so onedimensional and
1,but that 's the best part of the movie
1,it 's all about a woman who is a witch of a
1,the movie was very good and it was very good
1,if this movie is a little long it is in fact the most interesting movie that i have seen in a long time
1,made by people who were n't expecting anything new from the first place they
1,likewise i thought that the movie was a bit slow but it was so good i just watched
1,many people have said it 's a comedy
1,the acting was ok and the writing
1,so why does it seem to be so obscure
1,but there are two things wrong with it
1,flash forward the camera and lighting
1,gowariker is also a genius who has a vision of
1,as the story unfolds the plot revolves around a young
1,the first time i saw it is when
1,his wife was so good that he was a good person
1,do n't be surprised by how much the film
1,this is the first movie i 've
1,the story is so predictable that i could not care less
1,i do agree with many of the comments posted here but this is not one of them
1,i saw this on the big screen and i thought that it was going to
1,the movie 's plot is about two young men who
1,or if you 're a fan of the genre
1,as i said before it has some very good moments and a few funny moments but it 's not really
1,this is a movie that will leave
1,i think that it 's a good idea for a movie to make
1,the movie is n't even that great at all
1,however i have seen this movie on youtube recently
1,although it did n't seem to have a lot of action it 's still
1,they should have had a little more time to develop the characters
1,it 's not a good movie
1,of course this is where you 're going to be
1,at first micheal is a jerk who has been a member of his own family
1,he is a little too eager to have a good time
1,slick is a great movie but it does not
1,not only is this film a very good
1,was he supposed to be a funny movie
1,i was n't sure if it was really a comedy
1,newman has been given a great opportunity by the young man who plays a very sympathetic role
1,and the movie is a good film
1,the script is so bad and the characters are stupid
1,cary grant plays the young man who has the heart to go to the city and his wife
1,it is not even a comedy
1,but i think this is one of the best in the business of cinema that will not be seen as an
1,when i watched it in the theater i was amazed by this movie
1,the only thing that is good about this film is the fact that you 're a fan of the original
1,it 's just a shame the director never
1,anything is a great show to watch
1,i think that was a mistake to be a great movie
1,i am amazed how much money it has to do with that
1,it 's a great movie for a rainy day
1,i would love to find a dvd that contains the original version
1,she was a good actress and that 's what i would say
1,no real character development or plot line no sense
1,this is a very bad film
1,as a result the script is pretty good
1,yet he 's still a little bit of a jerk but he is n't in it
1,red eye was one of my favourites to
1,even if the plot is not a little
1,i was so shocked by it
1,a very good movie for those who love good movies like that
1,your only friend and i do n't think i can find it in my home video stores
1,the story is n't bad it 's not bad enough to be funny
1,i think it is that the director and director of this movie had a
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,all i have seen is that this is a very good movie
1,i am a fan of the book but there was no way to get excited and it would n't have
1,they were both very very funny
1,and the movie was just plain stupid
1,if you are looking for a movie to be entertained and watch it then watch it and
1,there is nothing wrong with the fact that i was watching this movie and did n't think the acting was good
1,this is n't a bad movie just to make fun of it
1,this is one of the best of the year that i have seen
1,but it is the best of the four movies
1,i am still a big fan and i have to
1,i was really excited at the time of the filming
1,but i guess that does not mean that this has been done by
1,what a waste of time and money
1,when the film is finished at the end of the movie it 's not a great film as well
1,unfortunately the story is too contrived and
1,it has the same feel of what 's going on
1,that 's all you 'll ever know
1,with a better cast and a better script it is a film that is so difficult to follow and is n't really as good as the original but
1,i was really bored by this film
1,brings out a lot of people that have a lot of fun
1,well i have to say that the only positive comment
1,what makes it so good is the fact
1,there were no good moments or the characters that were either
1,the movie has a lot of fun in it
1,his wife is a very rich and
1,it is the first film to make the movie
1,how could the filmmakers have a film about it
1,the only reason i did n't give this a 1 was because they had to have a good laugh at the camera and the actors and actresses
1,i have seen this film countless times in the past 10 years and it has been a long since my memory
1,by the end of the movie we are left with a
1,how many times have you seen this film
1,her performance was so good i was looking for it with her eyes
1,in fact i would love to see more of her work
1,and it is a good idea as it goes on for some
1,finding out he 's not the one to save it from a new
1,watch it to see if you can get a chance to see it in the theatre and see it for yourself
1,major spoiler ahead i was expecting a film based
1,a very good film and it was fun to see
1,burt reynolds was in fine form as a tough guy
1,in fact this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch
1,sort of like a typical hollywood blockbuster with a lot of sex
1,however i found it very funny
1,it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,the only problem i have with this movie is how much more than a little more than
1,unfortunately this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer and i
1,for a start the director does n't seem to know what to do with the story
1,what 's more i can say for the
1,a lot of people do n't know the real reason why they are
1,why do n't we just see him get a
1,overall it 's a great movie
1,ok let me start with the fact that it 's not a bad movie
1,one day a guy who 's supposed to be his wife is a little older then his wife
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was shot on a shoestring budget
1,harry and his family are all in cahoots with each other
1,however the movie is very good
1,and there 's a good reason to see this film
1,robert duvall has an excellent performance as the evil but honest
1,this movie has a lot of fun to it and the whole idea of the film has a good time
1,the only way that the movie was ever filmed is
1,there is no real plot to follow in the story and the acting is pretty bad
1,why is n't it a movie about a
1,my friend and i rented this on video because of the cast and i thought it was great
1,conclusion the plot is n't bad either and it does n't make sense the whole movie is a
1,she is a very attractive woman and i do
1,high school confidential was made in the seventies with a few exceptions in the cast and crew
1,my advice is to avoid the film from the box office and to see the sequel on the cover
1,it was a great film and i
1,liam neeson as the villain of the title is a fine
1,the film is about a group of friends who go to prison for a reunion to get the job done
1,ca n't you see the movie as a whole
1,soon enough the film begins to take its toll and turns into an allout
1,he does not need to go back to the states he
1,it 's like the first film that was shot in the
1,lion 's gate is a classic example of how the genre works with its
1,so much of the film is filmed in the same location as that of a young couple 's home on a farm
1,it 's a very bad movie
1,this is a very entertaining film
1,this is a very funny movie
1,both have a lot to do with it
1,if you are in for an interesting and intriguing film do n't miss
1,this is n't a good film but
1,let 's get back to the movie
1,this is the first movie i have had that
1,interestingly this show has the best lines that i have ever heard
1,but if you 're a fan of the original series and are looking for a
1,i was a little disappointed but the film is
1,the acting is horrible and the special effects are very poor
1,there is no point that this is a movie that has a lot of laughs in it
1,this is what happened to her
1,i think it is a good choice to make a movie that will keep me watching for a while
1,there should have been a lot of movies like this one and the ones that
1,this is the first and final collaboration with
1,i think this movie could have been made a little longer
1,it 's a shame because this is one of her more underrated films in my time and she 's the only one in the cast which is a great actress
1,a movie like this that you should
1,i would say that this movie was great and i would like to know what it would be
1,i'm sure that i 've seen it all over the years and never will i never see anything that
1,but the story is so simple and so predictable
1,normally the plot is n't that good and the story is very predictable
1,these guys are a joke and i would not say that the actors
1,the movie starts out ok the first 20 minutes are interesting but the
1,the first time i saw this movie i was in the theatre
1,documentary was n't a bad movie at
1,i 've always liked the first film but
1,however there is a very strong element of an otherwise disturbing and unsettling film
1,since the film was n't so much of a film it is also very well directed
1,everything in this film is so awful it makes me want to vomit
1,the acting and directing are horrible
1,note how the director managed to create a film that would be so much more than the sum of
1,and the scene with him is a very funny one
1,i was expecting to be entertained and i did n't
1,slowpaced and very funny with the usual plot devices
1,i 've seen many bad movies and i have n't seen this
1,so i guess it will be the only thing we can do to get out of it
1,it 's a shame that such a film ever made such a bad film and the fact that
1,directed by the same director who made it this
1,why did n't i watch this movie
1,there was a little bit of blood but it was n't
1,however i was n't sure whether i was in the theater with the characters or the characters
1,tanner has to be the most likable character in the film and i have to tell you that
1,another scene is that it is almost as though the writer
1,it also shows that it is an old film with the same exact same story
1,only one thing to describe this film is the fact that it is not only a movie
1,that said i am a huge fan of this
1,while i did not like the ending i did not think the ending was really satisfying
1,all in all a great movie and worth a look
1,it was a waste of time
1,why not do a remake of the first movie which was
1,michael moore is a talented actor
1,and the ending is pretty good
1,when i read a review that was written by another user i thought the film was a
1,this is one of the most memorable and
1,now this was a good start but it did n't even come close to being a good movie
1,dominick is a good actor who can be seen by many of the actors who play a good
1,preposterous story lines that make no sense
1,keep on watching the film again it is a
1,but this was the first time that the movie has
1,his character was so annoying that you actually care for the character
1,the story is a bit thin and the story is too predictable to be believable
1,as a result we can see that the characters of each other are so real
1,sure there are some very good moments but there 's a
1,once again it 's a good thing that a good
1,the only thing i could have done was the film 's title
1,reflective of the story of the young man and his family the film is also full of clichs and jokes that are not in the least bit funny or entertaining
1,the plot is so bad the acting is so awful and the plot
1,cho 's father is killed by a group of thieves and he becomes involved with a very
1,the movie itself was n't so much of a comedy as it could have been
1,when he finally gets to see the old man 's house
1,granted this film does boast a bit of nudity and it is very
1,see how the movie was shot
1,that is what the movie does to the movie
1,it is an excellent film and one that will never make the audience smile at the screen
1,i would n't want to be a little more surprised at some of the comments
1,when i saw this movie i felt that a little too much was needed
1,besides the acting and acting the movie is a
1,the movie starts with a bang on the head with a couple of other scenes but the movie never gets boring
1,he was a great actor but his character was so bland i could n't get over
1,the story is n't all that bad though it 's not as good as its predecessor
1,overall the film is a little dull
1,some of the other comments were so wrong
1,this is the worst of all of the movies that have come
1,the acting is terrible the script is awful
1,i would have been surprised by this one
1,morgan freeman is a revelation in this
1,and i have seen it countless times
1,reallife and the film does not work in
1,my favorite parts of the film are the scene at a bar scene
1,another thing i did not like was the acting by all of the actors
1,second it was a little boring but not
1,dialogue is so bad it 's funny
1,once in the future i thought the movie had a lot of promise to it but it 's a great movie
1,i was n't really bored at all about it
1,trapped in the streets of paris the film also deals with a subject of a young boy named seita a man who lives on the same farm with his wife and two daughters
1,actually it 's a good thing to watch it
1,for the longest part of the movie we learn the story of
1,more importantly the film was made in a cheap way and a few times that it would make the movie even more enjoyable
1,you can get the idea of this film from a director who has n't worked for me
1,in my opinion a film that should be shown to any
1,jeanne is the best thing in the picture but she does n't really have a chance
1,macross is a good family movie with a strong message and
1,oh and i did n't know the real name was n't it
1,the script is very weak and the script does n't
1,he has an excellent cast and the movie is a perfect showcase for the whole
1,even a few of the characters seemed underdeveloped
1,i think the movie was very entertaining because it was so bad that i could not stop laughing at the film
1,i do n't know where the plot is going but
1,critiquing the original was a good movie
1,there were so many great lines in this movie
1,the film is also very well directed
1,this was a very poor production
1,the movie is a complete mess from start to finish
1,i would recommend seeing this one if you have n't already
1,it was n't even funny enough to be funny
1,oddly it 's a shame to see a movie like these that i
1,standing in the dark and the dark and the
1,i think the movie was a complete waste of my time
1,the movie itself is a little dated in places but the fact that it is based on the actual novel makes it more fun
1,when the film is over and the director and his wife have taken their time to
1,worlds were so bad that the movie made no attempt to make it to a
1,writerdirector michael mann had made a great deal of movies that have n't been released by the
1,of course he 's not a good director
1,there was nothing original about it
1,the acting is terrible with all the actors
1,when i saw the film on a shelf and was
1,then the story begins slowly to reveal what 's going on
1,tom savini is a genius in the film
1,one of the most memorable moments in this
1,now we see the man who was born and raised in a small pension in his own country
1,these guys were n't even good
1,it 's a real treat to sit through a film like this to make
1,hitch 's character is not very well developed
1,president kirk is a great actor who 's been
1,to me it 's a great show that is worth watching and it 's not the best movie that i 've ever seen
1,if you want to get the wrong impression of watching this film
1,in the meantime the movie starts to fall apart from the start and the characters do not really have much of an impact
1,most of the scenes are just too much
1,teresa and rebecca are both very attractive and the men and men are beautiful
1,and then there are the actors in this film
1,anne hathaway is a good actress
1,they do n't seem to care for any of the characters
1,my favorite part of this movie was when the guy and gal were talking about how he had been in jail and i was laughing at how
1,now that 's all there is to say about this movie the acting is very fine but the plot was weak and the characters
1,i'm a teenager myself but this movie has a lot of good things going
1,for those who do n't understand this film i 'd strongly recommend it
1,ending is the only way this film could possibly make it
1,the film is a bit slow at times and is
1,her performance in her character is a delight
1,they 're all good but not in a good way
1,to me it was a good show but it
1,laughter and not a great film are the two of them
1,bottom line if you have a soft spot for a film you should see the original
1,i was surprised when i saw it
1,i saw this movie at the boston film festival and it was so horrible it was painful
1,why did the people in the movie think that
1,a lot of movies that seem to have been cut to a different level
1,the movie is a bit over the top and the
1,you can tell that they 're not supposed to be the same person as
1,about as bad as the first film
1,remake the first and second season i think it 's a very bad one
1,the first thing you notice in this film is the
1,that 's the only positive thing i
1,springs to the scene that the movie is trying to portray
1,bettie foster was very beautiful and the acting
1,the film opens with the two main players in the middle east of the city of mexico and
1,although it 's a film of sorts and it 's still the most memorable thing in the movie
1,i would not go into it knowing how it was going to end
1,i think that this movie is one of the worst
1,like most of the other reviewers here i found it hard to follow the fact that i
1,you 'll find the most annoying thing you 're ever likely to see
1,besides all these films and the fact that the film 's characters are n't developed at all it has to
1,so i was n't expecting this to be the first time i saw it but it was n't bad either
1,congratulations to the writer for trying
1,i would have loved to see this film redone in the
1,john carpenter 's the thing is this
1,heath ledger was a wonderful character and i loved his characters
1,number 3 is the weakest movie i have ever seen
1,it was a very good movie
1,she 's the only person who can be blamed for a very long time
1,doc was so funny and funny and
1,had it been a drama about the evils of war i would have had a good time to go see this film
1,and it 's a great show
1,the only reason i gave this a 2 out of 10 is because
1,harrison ford has a lot of screen
1,of course he has no luck in his job at all
1,a very funny movie about the lives of
1,it is a shame to see this on tv again
1,and i do n't know where the hell is
1,to begin with the story the characters and the plot were the same the movie is not the greatest of them
1,i 've watched a few scenes of this movie that are really
1,ten years later a woman named melissa is a young woman who is a young woman in her new york
1,i saw this in the theater
1,a young woman travels across the country
1,instead it 's a very good film that is worth watching and is worth watching
1,those who think that you can enjoy the movie are the ones that make you feel like you
1,the film was also very good
1,you know what 's going to happen
1,i have to wonder if the director had to be in
1,i was surprised how the movie was made and
1,do n't be tempted to do anything else unless
1,you know that there are some good ideas about the
1,filming is a joke and there 's also some very good acting in the cast but the whole thing looks very amateurish
1,a film that will not be forgotten by many people who have n't seen it
1,yet the film never really shows any signs of it 's just an attempt to make
1,he has the ability to pull him off the street while
1,their relationship is a bit too much but the film is also
1,christian slater 's character is the only one who is given the choice of
1,during a time the girls were n't even close to the truth of being a parent
1,if you 're a fan of the first two films then this is
1,i have n't seen any of the films in
1,any other film that was released in the same year has one of the most memorable endings
1,i saw this film in the theater and the title sounded great and there were a number of very funny scenes in which this film
1,besides that i have a soft spot for the story of the movie
1,not that i have any preconceived knowledge of
1,i would n't have known that he would be a good actor
1,but it is so bad that it 's almost
1,i think that the film is n't a great movie as a movie and
1,you 'll find yourself wanting to see more of her in the movies
1,yet the film has an enormous amount of action sequences
1,i do n't think that a film that could have been made by a group of friends would be more entertaining than the first
1,i was so excited when i was watching the film
1,what is the deal with the rest of
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie
1,it 's all pretty much all about
1,she also looks a lot like the real star of her role
1,then i got a hold of my head and i had to watch it again
1,however the director is n't a great director
1,any selfrespecting horror film fan would want to be bored
1,there is a very good reason that we see this movie in a different light than the usual suspects that have
1,when i first heard of the movie the first time
1,then i went out and bought the movie
1,mostly the film 's story is a very
1,it was not a great movie i just felt sorry for them
1,it would have worked better if it was more
1,this is the first movie i 've seen in a
1,the movie is about a man who
1,the only real drawback is that the movie is very good
1,oh i was n't a big fan
1,this movie has the same plot a little romance but
1,in the first one you know that she does n't want to be
1,but then i realized that the movie was made in a hurry
1,i saw the movie when i was a child in a class and it 's so bad i just did n't know what to expect but i do n't
1,this is a movie that should be viewed and
1,all in all a great movie
1,ok so it 's a shame because the film was a bit
1,this was a really nice movie and i
1,both have to be a great movie and i have to watch it again
1,while the story is very well written and has the same elements as the other two films the acting is
1,neither do we have to wait for the next one to die
1,i think they should have been more believable
1,her performance is so awful that even the actress playing the
1,overall i 'd highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone involved should check it out
1,clark kent was a bit of an enigma but in this movie he 's just a great talent
1,i would recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh and appreciate the first movie of the last century and this movie is just awesome
1,there are a few laughs in here but the movie does not have a single redeeming quality
1,i have to admit i was a little disappointed at all because of the poor dubbing
1,in fact it 's a shame that the film is
1,i think this movie was made in the us and i am
1,b is n't bad but is n't really the case
1,aamir khan and james spader are a great actor but this movie was so bad that it was funny
1,the film is a very good movie
1,a few years later he is in a coma of a
1,not a good film to start with but it 's not
1,classic and i do n't think i 've seen a better life and i 've always thought that this movie was
1,done with the help of a friend who 's a little more experienced than the first one the script is n't quite good the acting is awful
1,the movie has a good deal of
1,in fact the film was a total bore and i would n't even have to have it in my collection
1,none of the characters in this movie were particularly
1,ashley judd is the only person who
1,the plot is very good and the acting was good enough but that of the story itself
1,a good cast is wasted and they should not have done this film at all
1,boyd is one of hollywood 's finest actors
1,high school musical is not a great film
1,the acting is horrible and i do n't even want to mention anything about it
1,i have never seen anything like this before and since i have seen the first movie i 've always liked the film but it has
1,my wife who was in college when this film was first released
1,d'amato is the master of the subgenre and this is a real pleasure to see in a film about
1,watch if you can make a mistake
1,the movie is also very funny
1,ok the acting and story line are great and the movie is very well done
1,none of the cast really deliver any of the goods
1,why did he have to use a rifle to do something
1,but that 's what it has to do with the rest of his career and it makes the movie
1,i have been in the area for years and i 've never
1,while the film does have a lot of potential it fails miserably
1,whether he wants a more interesting role in the film or what he is trying to
1,most of the time it is n't even remotely funny but it 's not funny
1,the acting is pretty good with lots of good actors
1,qin is a very very young woman who is the sole
1,she 's a little too young to be
1,in short a very interesting portrayal
1,one of his best movies in this genre is the fact this is one of his best movies
1,wayne and matthau have the perfect chemistry in the film as they are in the latter
1,the movie was just as bad as
1,definitely a must see for everyone
1,the only reason i can think of a film that has the potential to be the film is that the film was shot in a studio
1,the film is a total mess
1,it does n't even have an ending
1,i think the director has the most important things to
1,as for the movie well i ca n't think of any good
1,if you 're going to make an indie film with a message to be made
1,the movie does n't even have a plot or character
1,in short this is a pretty good movie
1,for the rest of us i would have enjoyed a lot more of this movie
1,this movie was just a poor excuse for some of its worst actors to make
1,a movie is a good idea but it does n't work
1,after the initial shock of a man 's body accident the
1,comparisons are so bad that they can make
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen on a movie theater
1,somehow i was n't able to watch the whole
1,but the real problem is that there
1,it is an excellent performance and it is the best of the three films in my opinion
1,this is a film that deserves a wider audience
1,yet there were some good scenes and a nice touch
1,you 're not going to be a
1,this movie is a must see for all ages
1,this movie was so bad it actually made the point of the
1,on the other hand the film is a bit slow
1,mr and mrs 's relationship is a joy
1,as far as i'm concerned with this movie i have n't seen the first one i 've seen that is the only
1,the first thing you noticed about the movie is how the movie was made and how it was
1,miramax should go out to the studio where this series is available
1,yes the film was a little bit of a bore but the ending was n't
1,it 's just the opposite that it 's all about the characters
1,even when the movie was over it was n't even good
1,here is an interesting film and the story is a bit over the top
1,often it does n't matter if the movie is a good
1,normally the movie is n't even funny at all but it 's funny how the kids were
1,they were also the best of the two movies
1,the story is a good one to follow
1,i'm sure you know what it takes to make it through this one though
1,when she gets a little girl she gets a
1,the film does n't have that much in it and the plot is a bit confusing
1,pinhead and his mate have a good
1,unforgettable to see her work in the past
1,when i was in high school at school i was n't sure why i should not
1,i would say that the director of the original film had
1,the film 's premise is about an alcoholic who gets to be a man
1,wickedly bad and the most ridiculous part is the scene where the three boys are driving a truck on the street to the end
1,it 's not as good as the first and the second
1,east germany is n't an art film it is a
1,while i was a bit skeptical i was still able to enjoy it
1,he 's a little bit too old in a movie that is
1,as a result a movie that should have been released in the us as a comedy
1,as it turns out the only reason it gets any
1,there are two things i did n't like about this movie at all and it
1,but the fact that this movie was a big hit and not a remake of it makes me think about a movie that
1,when you do get the chance to see the first film you will be hooked
1,and then the story of the girl 's life and her friends and the
1,these two actors were great together
1,here it is a very good film with great actors
1,she 's not the worst actress she 's in her
1,it 's not a total loss and it is n't
1,veteran is a good actress as the
1,i 've been watching this movie several times in a long time
1,this film is about as much of a
1,i do n't know what it is all about it was just a movie
1,i would have preferred more about this movie
1,i'm not a fan of the genre
1,see the film for the great cinematography of the movie
1,i do n't think they 've made any more money to create an atmosphere of film
1,i have to say i was a bit confused at the beginning and the end but it still left me cold
1,some of the scenes in the show were quite hilarious
1,mary steenburgen plays the character in a very unusual performance in a film that was very good
1,the movie 's plot is so bad that even a few people seem to think
1,and i do n't know how i could n't find it but i do n't think it is the funniest film ever
1,furthermore the movie is not so much a comedy as the original
1,the movie also is very interesting and does n't
1,much more than i was able to say was i was n't expecting a lot more from this movie
1,so it would be a good movie
1,after the success of the original 'star trek' was released a year later
1,pretty soon he meets a girl and falls in love with him and he 's a big one
1,rutger hauer gives a great performance
1,low budget film that 's pretty good
1,there was nothing wrong with this film except the last twenty minutes of the movie
1,or if you are a parent you are a big fan of the
1,dolph lundgren is also a great actor
1,this film does n't deserve the credit it deserves
1,overall the acting is good but the script by the way is n't bad
1,the film is about a family of people that have a different outlook
1,i was n't expecting anything else and i was pleasantly surprised
1,i am not a fan of the original
1,the story of two girls who have to
1,i am glad it was released on vhs
1,well i do n't think this is
1,the movie is very slow moving
1,because this movie is so bad that it
1,if you have not read this book you 're missing something
1,same as in the first one
1,even the actors are all fine
1,and if you are a diehard fan of the original you will love the film
1,just like the other films in the
1,i saw this film on tv
1,this movie is about a group of people who go through a midlife crisis and have to deal with a group of high school
1,after that they are all the characters and that the characters are all very believable
1,i have a fondness for films like this
1,his wife who is a child has been raised in a mental institution with
1,nobody has ever been a fan of the original
1,a great movie for the kids
1,fredi washington is a genius and a talented actress who is also the
1,these people are just not good either
1,the story of a woman who is a very good and fulfilling person in an apartment complex
1,it 's not a good thing to say that this is an excellent
1,in the end it seems that the film makers have a hard time figuring out what was going on in the first place
1,his character is not very likable but he was the best actor in the business
1,in the end the movie was a waste of money and it is the first film i have ever seen
1,i was expecting a lot more from these characters and i would like to see more of them
1,of course there is the obligatory and the bad guy
1,while there is no plot and the characters are n't as developed as in the original
1,it 's not just an ordinary film with a few
1,maybe if you are looking for a good film
1,this one is just plain awful
1,but the film was made on a low budget and the acting is good
1,she is n't a good actress or she can do anything else
1,i saw this movie yesterday and i really wanted to like it
1,this was a very funny movie and i really wanted to
1,another one of those films that i would n't have had a crush on
1,i think this is the best part of the movie
1,enough to have been a good movie
1,there are some good things but i did find it difficult for them to be very believable and
1,plus the acting is good especially for the kids who
1,let me just say that i have to say that it has a lot of potential
1,a few years later the film is shot by a
1,down for the screen the film is just a bit too long for the
1,if you 're looking for something to laugh about and do n't get into the film 's ability to be a little too long i would recommend watching the first one
1,the acting in the film was good but the script and
1,chris klein is a great actor in this but he does not have an
1,vodka is a movie that is just so stupid
1,a very nice movie about a man
1,in a time when mcdonalds is a very bad film
1,oh yea i was in the mood for this
1,so much of the film 's plot is centered on it
1,they are all good looking but they 're pretty much a tad too old for the movie
1,total garbage in my opinion is the best of the two
1,but there was no need to see more of it
1,the film is a very good movie with some good actors
1,i do n't care how many people who have
1,it was a waste of time for a couple of people who were n't
1,there are many other movies of this kind
1,personally i was very impressed with this picture
1,having said that i would love to see a film with this sort of thing
1,et al was a wonderful film
1,i would n't have given this film a higher rating but i do give it a 1
1,when you do get into an interesting story the characters have a lot to live up to
1,because i am a fan of movies such as i 've seen them with a similar
1,this is not a film for everyone
1,but then you have to be very wrong
1,i was very surprised at how many movies were shot in the early 80 's
1,coscarelli is the master of this story and
1,george c scott plays an important role in this movie as well
1,she is a woman who wants to get her out of her life
1,so the film is n't as good as the first film
1,if it was a movie about a group of friends it is a film
1,i have n't been impressed to watch this movie over the years but i think that 's what i think is the best film i have ever seen
1,i have seen the film approximately the past few weeks and the only one who has any interest whatsoever is
1,in the case of the film it is not so much in the way of a plot as that of a young man who is n't
1,audrey heigl 's acting is not convincing
1,cheryl ladd and william wyler are a good combination of the leads
1,here is a film about the lives of people who are
1,being a fan of films this one is a must see
1,if you want to watch a bad movie that 's just plain bad this is what i did
1,if you 're going to watch it i recommend seeing this movie
1,i saw a screening in the theater when i saw this movie on tv in the late 80 's
1,his father 's father dies at the age of twelve when his father 's father has gone to his father to
1,how do the writers and directors get involved in this movie
1,harry is a good film with a lot of good moments but it 's just plain bad
1,far better than the first two
1,how many movies about the same can be said about this one
1,i was surprised to find that a movie was made for the sole reason to enjoy this film
1,you will be surprised at the overdramatic plot twists
1,and the movie is a mess
1,the script was n't bad but the film was n't bad enough that the story
1,at least i have n't seen it in any other film
1,perhaps it 's a good idea and a good idea for a comedy but the film is n't as compelling as
1,and there 's a good performance from the lead actor
