0,it was n't a horrible you sure can relate to what it should be and get laughs from hulk hogan is the star
0,betty should have shown this in decline but he failed to be
0,this movie will move well slack on how to make a different movie
0,more importantly his character is much more creepy than anything else although he possesses his feelings and slowly causes dots
0,maybe now i would now replace ilona claiming i got a pass to julia lansbury why would she allowed this
0,kristy grahame created a creepy dignified thriller that got even more compelling by
0,watching the credits on this disc there 's something as spiritual as this movie is for a large part of the media as it also benefits from the period made entertainment
0,the innocent uneasy rich man suzanne marion begins to touch bill 's thumb in her sexual mindset in a dingy clutter building again her multimillion eventually

0,and well i thought it had many ways to be a big german classic
0,with all due respect or pace as a patient i still find that he
0,but it 's not for everybody it probably will be strictly
0,helm is basically a very bad film by establishing a extensive
0,from the first scene in which a comet is cobbled to a wax movie should be made
0,it 's amazing especially that
0,tempo is still nonexistent enough in time to go and give cartoons and actors coupled with them
0,all in all it has a very good score and the humor
0,have we ever had the training of our family
0,jack lemmon career when it comes to minded american poet on a
0,i say this is a director felt like driving a car car park etc
0,with the killing of the supernatural in the fact that they still have been old enough to turn into
0,but it 's not a bad movie your standard of film clichs and video a review from a banal
0,i think that it 's full of humor
0,the problem with this movie is that the brains make hurt visits society in crawford 's skin
1,as the series continues to have a huge amount of laughs and the characters are n't all that interesting
1,15 years later the film begins to fall apart
1,though this is one of his very best i 'll give it a 1010
1,unfortunately there are a couple of things that
1,because of the lack of the cast the script and direction are so weak that it 's difficult for the audience to get to
1,here 's where you start thinking about the plot
1,do n't worry that the filmmakers do n't have a budget for
1,this was not a good film
1,if you want to watch the film i suggest you watch the dvd version
1,a movie that has a lot more laughs than it 's subject matter
1,using the words to describe what is the greatest and most experimental film i have seen this film is a
1,directed by a guy who has no talent at all
1,while the original was a little slow paced with a bit more of a few scenes of the film it is still enjoyable to watch and a great deal of action
1,personally i do n't know how much it has a cult following and i would n't have been so impressed if they had n't
1,real estate agent is an important character in the world who has no clue about his life and his own
1,saw this at the cinema in a class and it had its own faults
1,i 've been watching the show for a long time
1,why do n't you just get that in
1,lots of fun and a little romance for those who are looking for a good action flick that is n't very bad
1,he is a little too old to be too old
1,or if you 're a diehard horror buff you have n't heard of a movie that has nothing to do with poe or even
1,acting varies from a good screenplay to a great cast
1,if you like the original you might be able to see what the movie is
1,in the end it 's a bit of a bore
1,at the beginning i had to watch the movie
1,well the first thing i notice is the lack of a story
1,what a waste of time and money
1,hence it 's a bit of a parody of the first
1,anyway if you are not a fan of the book this is a must see
1,the acting ranges between a good and subpar one which is n't really bad at all
1,one of the most interesting things about this documentary is that it was made in the early 80 's
1,i have been in the military for some years now but i still have some doubts about this movie
1,his wife is an alcoholic who has no interest in a woman in
1,the movie is just a bit of a mess
1,it was a very entertaining film
1,all this film is a must have for anyone interested in the history of the world
1,i do n't think this was the first time i saw it i could not remember it
1,these two men are very good and the story is so strong that i could forgive them
1,with the exception of the director 's commentary on the film the plot is
1,the story is very weak and predictable with no depth or explanation whatsoever
1,in this movie the main character 's father was
1,reminds me of the classic hollywood film 'the thing' which i found in the cinemas
1,not to mention the acting was pretty bad especially the guy in the white suit but
1,my wife and i watched it on tv
1,the first is a great movie that is so good that you 'll laugh out loud at the
1,erik and a group of men who are in a wheelchair with their arms have a secret admirer
1,while this film is a bit slow moving to say the least i think it was one of the better ones in this series
1,the acting is superb in a lot of ways and the film is not just about the people that the film portrays
1,this show is a must for all
1,she 's got a lot of fun with her role
1,it is n't that good or the bad guys
1,in my opinion i did n't know this was a low budget movie but it was n't bad either
1,none of us have any respect for
1,robin williams is a wonderful actor and i do not have to go to the movies he has done
1,for me this is a very well written movie
1,when a movie is a bad attempt at making a statement about the evils of the holocaust it 's not so bad it just makes no sense
1,he 's an amazing talent in every episode
1,it was so bad that i wanted to watch the movie
1,how could it even have been so long that
1,this is a very good film
1,in my view it is a great example of how a movie can be so great and that the filmmakers have decided to make
1,both actors do n't make their own good
1,title spoilers spoilers ahead the movie was pretty much made for tv and
1,unfortunately it is also a film about the holocaust in which the characters are so stupid
1,then he gets to be the one to die and be the
1,i was surprised by the amount of detail and originality
1,the movie was a lot of fun and i think the film
1,i do n't think it 's a bad idea but it was a good
1,while there 's a scene in which a young guy goes on a rampage with a woman she does n't
1,narrator has been the smartest of the three
1,been a huge fan of the series and this movie does n't have a great storyline or a good cast
1,and the whole thing is just so funny
1,a good movie and a good one as well it was made for the fans of
1,a great deal of humor is needed here but that 's the only thing good enough to give the film a chance it is n't that bad it 's just awful
1,the film is a little slow paced
1,other people do n't even know about the plot and it seems to have been
1,alright so i 'll admit that this movie has a lot going for it namely the fact that the plot is
1,i have no idea how anyone would react to
1,goldsmith is a master film of the late forties and early talkie noir
1,another problem that i can say is that it 's not a very good one at the beginning but i do
1,what i really liked about was that it was actually a film about a serial killer in
1,it would be better to see it again in the future and i am
1,for example the two leads are the only one
1,read the book if you can
1,it 's not a movie to watch for those interested in
1,two of the characters in the movie are the two characters who are also in the
1,most films i have seen in a similar vein of this genre and the same
1,yes i have not seen a lot of movies but this one does
1,the first one is that good
1,it 's not that the movie makes sense but the acting
1,it would be interesting for a person to see a movie with more
1,this movie had me laughing and cry
1,if you can make a film that has a lot more than just a few words then the whole thing is pretty damn bad
1,he has the right to make a
1,ideally it is n't that much more of a thriller than anything else but it 's a little too short
1,but i guess it was a very good movie
1,allinall it was a great show
1,ca n't wait for a sequel
1,i have to say i did not think i 'd read a book that was a bit more interesting
1,i 've watched this film twice and have never seen a worse film
1,are there not some good actors
1,and that is why i was n't able to see it
1,coincidentally it was an accident of the world and the us army of the philippines
1,the movie is a bit too short but it really is n't
1,from the opening shot of the film the movie is set in the background to the point of view
1,notice a lot of the scenes are done with a couple of scenes of which were cut off
1,but this movie has the same kind of humor that it was later in the movies
1,but it 's a great little film
1,his work is a bit too dark
1,the first half of the film takes place in an abandoned house
1,if you want a movie that you can enjoy from the very beginning it
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,between these two men the movie is set in the very real west of india the film 's focus on a group of young
1,a few weeks later i was looking for my life in a way and the film was a real treat
1,i saw this movie in a small town in the us and it 's one of those
1,technical license to the movie is an example of how
1,it seems like the writers wanted to be a serious horror movie and they were n't even remotely good in a way
1,it 's not that the movie is n't bad
1,queen latifah 's performance in the film is quite good although she looks
1,and what 's with the characters that are n't developed as in real
1,i was really excited to see that this
1,as the movie unfolds we get a sense of what we have imagined
1,one of these movies that you could n't find out about
1,the movie is a great example of how a good movie could get a
1,i was hoping it would end but that 's what it was
1,perhaps it 's the best of the films
1,so why is n't this movie rated so low
1,jackie chan plays dr knox and the only other person in the
1,faith is an example of the kind of humor where a group of men are being killed off and in the middle of a forest of a few seconds
1,in fact it is a little bit too long and i ca
1,so the plot is very simple and the acting is just awful
1,cant have been done with the film by many
1,the plot has a few twists and turns
1,the film has been told to have been
1,perhaps the worst film i have seen in a long long time
1,i am a big fan of the first film
1,jennifer tilly was the only reason why she was so great in this movie
1,there are several scenes that make you
1,he was a great character in this episode and that is why he 's not just about his age but his acting
1,the acting was ok and the story line was great and it was n't too much
1,grueling but the film is a little
1,these are the only reasons you 'll want to see it
1,instead they were n't the least bit interesting in the first place
1,and the movie is so bad
1,our hero and his friends are a group of friends who are not as good as their counterparts but they are
1,i do n't know if it 's supposed to be a comedy or comedy but it just does
1,or perhaps this is the most boring film ever made
1,the film is a very moving one and the acting is very good
1,if you 're a fan of the book you will probably not have missed out on
1,grace 's performance was very good and i think the best part of the movie for me was when the girl had a boyfriend who was a lesbian and a lesbian and a woman and the girls were
1,stylish and exciting is the film of its kind in a
1,the acting and writing are horrible
1,ok maybe the film is a total waste of time
1,now i have a lot of things to say about this film but i
1,i would have liked to see more of
1,currently i am the first to have to watch it again on a whim
1,remembering that he was not so good as a child he was
1,however the movie has some of the worst dialogue you will ever hear
1,i have to say it did n't make sense to me
1,the first half of the movie is very good but the script is n't very funny and i think the actors were n't really that
1,they do n't get a chance to
1,in one scene we see him walking through the woods in front of a camera and
1,charlie wilson is one of my favorites
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,what i found interesting was how they made
1,overall this movie is a great example of how
1,but i was n't sure if it is a real horror movie or a horror film
1,the movie 's plot is a bit thin but the script by david chase is n't too bad
1,perhaps the most important part of his is the casting of the three
1,the movie is not a good idea
1,there are some funny moments and a very good ending but the whole plot is so bad that it 's not even funny
1,this movie is one of the most overrated films ever made to make
1,even the music was n't as memorable as the first
1,antonio banderas as the evil cop is also quite good as his character
1,he is the one who does n't know anything
1,deniro is a great actor and the rest of the cast is good
1,i do n't know what to say
1,phillippe and his mate are both good and evil
1,my favorite part in this film is when you 're watching
1,he is not even a great actor
1,to me this movie was n't a complete disaster
1,on the other hand he is a great actor
1,tom is a good man but is n't afraid to take
1,obviously there was a lot of time spent in the movie and the actors are n't all that good
1,i 've been watching this movie on tv for years
1,burr has done a good job in
1,black robe is a very low budget movie with an interesting plot but i really liked the acting and the story it is a
1,i'm sure i 'd rather be a part of it 's life
1,it has no story and it is about a young boy who is a
1,as for the rest of the actors it 's pretty funny
1,and that 's not a very good thing
1,television has the best of the best
1,i have seen a lot of movies
1,his father 's death is n't quite as good as the
1,it 's like a bunch of people who were n't afraid
1,the plot is about a young man who is diagnosed
1,let 's start with the music and the acting
1,all in all i 'd rather watch a movie about a young girl in her life who would not have made the
1,her performance is the only good element of the whole affair
1,down to earth and the other two men in the
1,as i said this is a must see for anyone who loves horror movies
1,but it 's still a great movie to see in a theatre
1,this movie is about the same
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,now it does n't make sense
1,this show has a certain amount of humor and humor
1,ok this movie was a bit cheesy
1,usually they 're the only two characters that could 've played the lead
1,print is the only film that i have ever seen on the big screen
1,unfortunately it is n't a movie that 's the worst ever made
1,it 's an amazing film and a must for any fan of the genre
1,a film like that should have been given a more realistic approach to this movie
1,naturally i found the story to be very very funny with a couple of interesting twists
1,dancy 's film is a classic and i would recommend this film to anyone
1,you do n't get to see the end credits of the movie but it was
1,let me say the whole movie is just a joke
1,henry czerny 's performance is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent as usual
1,the film has a nice touch and is quite atmospheric at times as it deals with a man who is
1,try not to get into this movie because it 's a complete mess
1,take a little too much time to make the story of the original
1,hence there are so many of them
1,it is a shame that such a
1,it 's a shame that this one was n't released in theatres
1,during that time he meets his friend and is taken prisoner and his son and sister
1,this is a film for all ages
1,i do n't think this show is supposed to be about religion
1,and i have to say it was a great
1,first of all it was a very funny movie
1,however this is not a very good movie but its a great film
1,or is he supposed to be a good man or a
1,the story of a woman named sadie
1,james bond is not a great actor but his character is so good that i
1,it is a story of two friends and one of the best love stories of
1,he was so annoying he could not get it right
1,it was a nice little movie but it 's still pretty funny and very interesting
1,i was really impressed in a very interesting story but this is n't a good movie
1,to me it 's the same kind of
1,the first is to be an example of this genre that is
1,the story is a little confusing for a horror movie and it 's a little predictable
1,i have been a fan of the likes of this film since it was made
1,stunts were used as a kind of backdrop to the film in the first one
1,baker and the gang of men have their own agenda and they 're also able to find the truth
1,maybe it was just a coincidence but it did
1,i do n't remember the last time you saw this movie i still do not believe that i can watch anything like
1,this is the best film of the year and it 's a must see for anyone interested in the history of society
1,a few days of the film is filmed as the film is shot in the head
1,now it was n't until then i saw it on the big screen but i was
1,next up the film to the end credits of the film the music
1,this film is a must see if
1,you 're not going to see any of the actors either
1,i was surprised by how it ended with me
1,the acting is terrible the story is bad and it 's just not that
1,when the first movie was finished i thought that this was going to be another bad sequel
1,after all the movie is about two women who are married
1,no doubt the film 's title was a big hit from the first film
1,throw the cast and the script together in a very believable way
1,i think that it 's a great movie to see
1,in the end the whole thing is really boring and pointless
1,the acting by the entire cast is excellent
1,i saw this movie yesterday and was surprised by the ending and i do
1,this film is a must see for anybody
1,things get together with him and the girls are
1,george sanders is perfect in this movie a great role for his performance in the first movie
1,encouraging the story of the characters the two heroes of a man in the woods with his own life
1,did n't they have a clue of why i think this is a very
1,if you 're not a big fan of the book you wo n't
1,unlike most films of the same genre this one has some very funny moments in
1,i do n't think i have a movie with such a great cast
1,still there is a bit of a story
1,just to make you think about how a man can get a
1,it 's all very obvious that the film 's only purpose is a little rushed
1,irene dunne is a revelation as the woman she loves and
1,of course it is a movie and
1,it 's just not enough for me
1,atrocious acting terrible direction bad editing and a complete lack of any real substance
1,we have the usual old hero
1,a lot of the film seems to have been filmed by the director and the director is
1,not to mention the fact that they 're supposed to be the
1,this movie is about a young man
1,the script is a bit thin and the
1,lori 's character in the book was also a nice girl but
1,but i ca n't imagine the people
1,labute 's first movie to be released is a complete failure
1,if you like the first movie you have to be a fan
1,unless you are a big fan of the series i will say that this is a pretty good movie
1,i think the only thing i did not think was that the movie was a
1,the story is not so bad it 's good
1,in a way it was the most boring movie i 've seen in an extremely long time and i do n't care
1,they 're also a couple of nice losers
1,chesty and his friend lisa are the only ones who can get away from the house and get away with it
1,cause of course i was n't impressed by the story
1,as a matter of view we have the
1,a lot of the scenes were done in a way that could have used the story and story
1,add to that the fact that you are not watching it at the very least you will be bored with it
1,this movie was one of my favorites
1,back then the movie is not bad at all
1,the acting was bad the direction was poor the story was boring and the ending was just a
1,bogart plays the role of a lifetime and the only character that can be played by the name
1,the film is a very funny comedy that does n't make any sense whatsoever
1,how about a character that does not speak and
1,after the opening sequence of the movie he 's in a coma and
1,having seen the movie for a couple of years i was very
1,the acting was horrible the plot was awful and the ending is so ridiculous
1,both films have more to them than this but they are so far better than this
1,this movie was so bad it 's funny
1,let it go on with a group of kids
1,if you are looking for something more interesting or interesting to watch the first time you
1,i'm not a fan of musicals but the acting was excellent
1,from the first scene of the movie i could go on forever and i do n't know what
1,the story is a little thin but it
1,the story is n't a total rehash of what happens but the characters are not very well developed
1,this film is a great example of why people are n't in need of money to make
1,zombie bloodbath ii is a great example of how the film is constructed and edited to a
1,jackie chan does not have any charisma whatsoever
1,one of the best i 've seen
1,after the death of his mother the daughter disappears from a mental institution and
1,there is no need to cram the story into a cohesive book and it is a good story
1,here is a good thing about how it 's not
1,now that 's about all this movie has going on
1,some of the characters are n't funny
1,but i do not recommend this movie to anyone
1,but i guess it 's a very
1,i think he has the right to be a good actor but
1,there is no reason for the characters
1,in a time when a film is a complete
1,this is a good film to watch
1,this was one of the worst movies
1,i 've seen a lot of movies
1,in this film the characters are all very believable but the
1,despite all of the shortcomings and the lack of a coherent ending that was more believable than this movie was
1,if you like the old fashioned love story you 'll be better off watching this
1,i was expecting a movie from the great director of a movie but i did
1,stardust was a very interesting story
1,although it is n't really a good movie it is a pretty decent film
1,i think the reason that this series has
1,this is a movie for you if you have a soft spot for the first time you
1,some have said that there are a lot of things that make this movie a must for
1,as far as the technical aspects of this film can be the first thing i
1,a movie about two sisters who are a child of sorts and who are
1,and i do n't understand it
1,i do n't want my money back
1,i am a fan of the original movie
1,barney has been a successful tv host for many years
1,it has a very very funny and
1,the movie is n't so much a little bit of a
1,at least it 's not a bad movie
1,both of these films have a good cast with great actors and great cinematography
1,anyhoo it is a bit slow for you to find the movie to be a bit slow but as i mentioned it did
1,caribe is an excellent movie and one that will keep you watching for the next few minutes
1,this is a pretty good film but it 's not
1,spielberg 's work is a perfect example of why he chose to give this film a
1,i would say that the movie had a lot of potential for it 's time and it is not very well done but
1,for those who enjoy this film i would recommend
1,other than that it looks like a good movie but it is not
1,i would recommend this film to those who love the
1,this is what you get to like and the film is
1,it 's a great film with a
1,she is not a good actress but she is the
1,take a trip to the us the film is a very funny one
1,hollywood was in a lot of ways to get the film to make us care about the characters
1,it 's not a film that i would watch if i could n't watch
1,when i first saw the preview i was very impressed by its own shortcomings and a very good story
1,the film is a little too long and too much for the characters to get involved
1,see how they could be so easily the one who is n't afraid to do so
1,carter is a good actor and the film is very good
1,even though i am a fan of movies that are made to
1,i have n't seen anything other than the two stooges
1,there 's a reason to see this movie
1,the movie is a very funny satire on the life of the great athletes and it does have a lot of action
1,it 's the story of a young man who lives in the town of wyoming and has a young brother
1,be warned that the film is not for
1,pitka has his own agenda and it 's easy to understand what he is saying he is going to be
1,in fact i 've seen some very bad bad ones
1,that the only thing good about the movie is
1,shots are filmed and the film looks like it
1,i do n't understand why the director chose
1,being a fan of the original and the remake i have n't seen the original
1,i do n't know if it will be on tv or
1,a young woman named angela has the ability to make the world into a world populated by her own
1,but it 's the story of the characters which are so real that they can barely make it interesting to see
1,sure you can see some of the actors
1,or the fact he is the same person who is in the
1,the film has many problems with the script and the acting
1,it does n't seem like a movie about a
1,i was n't disappointed by the story the direction was a little confusing
1,the story of a young woman who moves in the middle of the
1,the plot of the film was a joke but it was n't even that funny
1,this movie is a must see
1,for the love of god do not see this movie
1,additionally the story is so bad i can only hope that the director andor writer would have had to have a
1,secondly the film 's main theme song is not a bit of a surprise to the audience in the film
1,sometimes this could be a great movie but it is not
1,apparently this movie is supposed to be a sequel to the original series
1,if the movie is not funny it 's not even bad enough to be good
1,her character is a bit twodimensional
1,and the movie was n't so bad it was a good thing
1,get ready for the next rudolph 's family
1,i was very impressed in this film but i did n't like the film for me
1,to sum it up this film is just plain bad
1,irwin allen is one of those actors who is a good actor but is
1,the movie is not for everyone
1,even though it may be a little dated the acting is n't bad the
1,this is a very good movie
1,beyond all that the film was a total waste of time
1,they have a lot of fun to do with
1,alas it is not a movie that will appeal to anyone who has never seen a
1,i am a huge fan of horror movies and i really liked it
1,i was surprised to see that he
1,a lot of the scenes were done by an amateur and there 's nothing else in the
1,the movie is a bit like an extended version of
1,overall a great film worth watching once
1,i would n't say that i was wrong but i was n't disappointed at all
1,it is an excellent movie that will keep you entertained until it ends
1,the film also stars a young woman named alice who has an affair with a young girl named melissa
1,she does n't even seem to care for the guy and they just ca n't even get the
1,it 's not so bad it 's good
1,while this one did n't make the grade good it was a very
1,ted and her family move out to the desert for their own
1,the story of the film revolves around two men in a hotel complex that is in their own
1,instead it was a little too long for me
1,the film is a great piece of work
1,it also features many fine performances by the three leads as well
1,it 's a pretty cool movie
1,i am surprised that a good film like the one in the book would have made this a very good film
1,do n't be fooled by the trailer cover of
1,on the way they go to the house of the dead and end up with a very powerful story
1,the film is not about a family of four brothers a mother and her
1,the film also has a lot of action sequences which makes it very easy to watch
1,i saw this movie and i thought the actors were great and the story was very good
1,this was n't a bad movie but it was just plain bad
1,you know the kind of thing you 've come up with in a
1,what 's worse is that the filmmakers of this show had a certain
1,probably the only thing that could have been that good
1,more than just a bad movie this is the worst of them all
1,even the soundtrack is n't as well done as some of the others
1,the movie has its faults and it 's a very good movie
1,after seeing the movie i thought that was the best thing
1,rudolf 's character is the most beautiful and most sympathetic characters in this series
1,the only thing that made me want to see the movie was that it is so stupid and boring i ca
1,the acting is good but the story and
1,the film is not only a visual medium but a documentary of the same subject matter
1,its just so bad its not funny
1,patrick warburton 's character is the only one who 's
1,in the first film the characters were just plain stupid and it 's not that
1,and what a waste of film
1,dialogue is the main problem here
1,if you want a movie that you should do n't want to be entertained then try not to watch this one
1,these two characters make the story and the characters seem like
1,the film is an excellent example of
1,is this a bad movie or is it just
1,oh yeah and that 's about what happened
1,yet another thing that makes the movie so great is the fact that it
1,the movie is just about as good as the book and you have no clue how the movie can
1,you do n't need to read that this film was made in the first place because it was a good movie
1,2 the movie is not bad enough
1,derek is a young man who is now living with his parents and a very strange life
1,by the time the movie was over i thought that there was another point to this movie that could
1,there are some funny moments and some very funny moments but
1,first of all i do n't know where the film went from there
1,it was a great idea for a movie
1,he does n't want to be the man of the dreams
1,raines and his wife are also the ones
1,avoid it unless you 're into a good horror movie
1,the script was pretty poor and the script is a mess
1,also starring the likes of david carradine and the aforementioned dennis hopper as
1,many people who say they have a copy of the film will be delighted
1,stanwyck is an actress whose best friend is a woman in
1,but the movie is n't all that interesting it 's
1,keep it 's a very enjoyable and original movie which is a shame it did n't take the slightest of its time
1,it 's a real shame because i have seen the movie in my head and have a feeling of being the worst movie of all time
1,they do n't even try that to explain what they are doing
1,even a movie like this could n't help it
1,just a bunch of kids who were n't in the movie
1,you will never see this film anywhere
1,the acting was pretty good but there was so much to it and i
1,but then again that does n't happen here
1,sex with the devil has a lot to do with the fact
1,but this one is so bad that you 'll have to sit
1,and there is the usual action sequence that is just
1,probably because it is the only film
1,the first time i watch it i can still remember
1,the only thing missing is the story of the movie the main protagonist of the movie
1,if you are a fan of the original and have seen the first two films in the series of the last
1,before you go to see it you can only watch a movie with
1,the plot is a bit confusing
1,people who have seen it know that it has the feel of
1,it 's a shame that such a bad review has never made it to dvd because i have n't seen
1,many people who do n't like this show is the same
1,more often i think the movie was made by a bunch
1,shivers 's a shame it was n't released theatrically before the release of the original and the remake of this classic
1,this is what happens to the audience
1,but i think they should have made a movie that was better
1,at least they have the decency to do it with a straight face
1,i 've never seen this movie on a tv show but i still think
1,great performances from the leads and the story of a
1,of course the film fails as a comedy that tries to be funny but fails
1,and the movie is n't so bad it is n't even funny
1,the story is about a man and his daughter who find happiness in the world and love to protect the world
1,ok so i was n't impressed but i found the
1,indeed it 's just a good movie
1,but the fact is that they 're not going to make it big to make us see how they were made out to be
1,it has some interesting scenes with one of the funniest characters in the movie
1,there is no reason why this movie is so bad
1,set in a small town town and the us government are trying to stop the poachers and save their life in the world of the civil war and its inhabitants
1,i have to say that i am a huge fan of hers but this movie is so awful that i just wanted
1,to be honest the film is very very slow and not enough to keep you
1,this is a movie about a young man and his wife
1,all the characters are very likable
1,we see the film as a vehicle for it 's
1,for me the highlight of the movie is the scene where
1,the movie 's premise is a bit of a stretch
1,it was a waste of time and money
1,all in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will make you laugh a few times and will be very entertained at how bad it is
1,this was a great show and i really loved how they
1,if you 're in the mood for a comedy then do n't go see this movie
1,perhaps he 'll be able to get away with this one as a whole
1,now that 's the way i do i have to think
1,most people have commented on how this movie was made
1,it has some great scenes of a good guy and a few
1,yet i do n't care if the film was intended to be a remake of a classic
1,truth is it is one of the most beautiful pieces of filmmaking
1,lang 's first film and the last days of the film has a very similar story and one
1,i was a bit prejudiced by the end of this
1,on this level it seems to me that it is a very good movie in its own
1,as the movie goes on you get to the point
1,this film should have stayed with me
1,also it 's a shame the film is a
1,the movie is not for everyone
1,he was just as good when it comes out in the world
1,the plot line is a simple one and you
1,dad is not a great film
1,farting on the cover and a few more things
1,the acting is n't bad but the script is awful
1,but that was the only redeeming qualities of this movie
1,both are very funny and i really do
1,the story was very very interesting and it was interesting to see the characters grow up with the same girl and in a more different direction
1,it has the worst acting i have
1,everywhere the movie is a complete failure
1,he is one of my favorite actresses
1,i do agree that there is a lot of good actors
1,you have to wonder if the film is really good and the
1,amy adams and the rest of the cast are excellent
1,lines are very funny and funny and this movie is a perfect example of why
1,the movie is also very funny
1,this movie was very entertaining and it was a great movie for those
1,while the film was not particularly interesting at all it was still a very good film to
1,bruce lee 's character is a caricature that could have been played in a
1,well i did n't like it and
1,parador is the best movie of this decade
1,other then the fact that it 's a bad movie
1,some say that it is a film about a bunch of people trying to make it to
1,this film is an insult to the intelligence and innocence of
1,one day i saw the first episode of it
1,i'm still not sure where i am going to go to this film but it
1,if you 're looking for a good movie with a strong story line and good acting this movie will be for you
1,all in all i was surprised that the film did n't have any redeeming features
1,despite this movie 's flaws it is n't as bad as it sounds
1,rowland 's portrayal of a man 's life was a bit heavyhanded but the story of her father was a very compelling and believable one and
1,this one was not the best i 've ever seen
1,that 's why i was expecting a lot of this movie
1,a lot of the scenes are just boring
1,the story was a bit too predictable and the ending was just a bit predictable
1,however this is a great movie
1,but it is a very enjoyable movie
1,does he know what the heck is going on
1,so if it were n't for it i 'll give it a 4 or a 0 it would be
1,there is a lot of good action and suspense
1,remember this is my opinion is that the film is a complete ripoff of a classic film
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,is it possible to be an adult in the past
1,the acting is so bad that it is laughable
1,whoever wrote this is the one who would have been a great fan of a great
1,with this in mind the film has some great acting and some of the best special effects ever
1,i have to admit that it was not as much fun to
1,i 've heard some comments about this movie but i have to disagree
1,i have never been so disgusted by a movie as this one
1,devito 's performance of a young woman is not a very good one
1,in the end this is a great film
1,it 's a shame that he has a better film career like this
1,not only is the story so interesting and the
1,it 's all the same as the first one
1,they do n't have to have to pay attention to the story
1,andreas 's father 's father is a young man named amir who is now a catholic and is now in the army in india where
1,i saw this film on the disney tv network in the early eighties
1,how does it get the rave reviews it gets from me
1,beach mile is one of the best films i have ever seen and
1,are they a little bitty and that 's what
1,i am not saying anything about it
1,unfortunately the rest of the cast does n't have
1,sonatine is a film that i would n't be able to watch as an early talkie
1,i do n't understand what to say
1,it has all the elements of a decent movie
1,this movie was just as bad as i could have imagined
1,it is the story of a boy who lives a life and death and his
1,the story of the film 's story of the kelly gang' is based solely on the book which
1,i do n't see how people can get away with it
1,both of these two have a very different personality that is very rare and very believable
1,my wife is a fan of the original film and this is the most underrated movie i
1,it is a very good show that is so funny and so funny
1,the movie was made at least a year later
1,he has a great voice and voice to play with and the character he plays does n't seem to be much to look
1,the film does contain an intriguing message about what happened and what is what it 's all about
1,but if you have n't seen it you 'll be disappointed
1,this movie has been made and i am not a
1,how can i get into this film
1,he is a man who loves to be a good boy and a love story
1,hollywood is a great actor and i would love to know what the film has
1,finally i thought this movie was great
1,it is n't just a good film that 's about the
1,it was the most painful movie ever
1,the acting is so awful that it was so bad i almost choked it up
1,if you are a fan of the original and you 're not a fan
1,at least he does a good job
1,fitzgerald is a master of the craft as a man who is not a very strong person he is a man
1,the acting was horrible and the plot was ridiculous
1,and the fact that he is so obsessed with his daughter makes a good impression
1,unfortunately it has a lot of good moments and the movie is pretty entertaining
1,that being said i think the film is a masterpiece
1,and i think that the actors in the movie had a good chemistry and the script was so funny and entertaining
1,the movie is a great piece of entertainment
1,shortly afterwards the two men are reunited with a very wealthy married man
1,the acting and acting was superb
1,pauly shore plays a young man who finds
1,a few minutes later the movie ends with a scene
1,i have to say that the movie was very bad
1,maybe this film will have to come up with a good reason
1,this is one of my alltime favorite tv movies
1,i think they could n't even afford a film that has the exact same plot and a few actors
1,the movie is a bit slow and drags too slow to keep you guessing and yet the characters
1,many of these are just the two things that are n't in the movie and
1,the film was also made by a very low budget and
1,seeing it again i could n't believe that i would not be
1,yeah i guess i 've been in for
1,i do not understand the appeal of the original film but i think that this is the worst adaptation of a classic film
1,so it 's a shame they did not go on to do such a success
1,the only reason i gave it the movie is because it is so stupid
1,vic 's son is an old man that lives in a small village in new jersey city
1,it 's a very funny film
1,i was really looking forward to seeing him in another movie
1,mr bean was just a little too young for the role and the acting was horrible
1,i was expecting something like the first
1,now i am not a big fan of the original series
1,the film does n't even have a story to tell and that is the movie
1,furthermore the movie is very well done and does n't have anything to do with the movie
1,they have no idea of who to
1,fellow actors were not the only actors in the movie who did n't make the movie tolerable
1,his character and his wife are also in a situation
1,it was n't the same thing
1,the movie is very well written and it 's a nice way to see how a film with a cast that has to be seen
1,i have to admit that i have been
1,miranda richardson is very good as the mother who is trying her luck
1,and then there 's this film
1,i do n't think they were making an appearance
1,it does n't seem to be that much of the time it does
1,tax impact is one of many
1,the acting is horrible the directing is worse and the script is just plain awful
1,kick in on the head to the point where you have to be
1,based upon an article of the book the story of a man with an alibi in a mental breakdown is a good
1,the story is so simple it 's almost unbelievable
1,i was n't sure whether or not to laugh at this film
1,even the acting is awful as well
1,korean film is a great film with a good story and
1,otherwise the acting was pretty decent and
1,importantly this movie was a complete waste of my time and money
1,there is a lot to this story but that 's
1,most of the characters are just as bad as the first
1,i do n't want to be more than just the one i 've seen in my life but in my
1,other things are that he 's a pretty girl
1,after the death of her mother he is convinced he is dead and he is left with a sense that he 's responsible for the murders of people
1,perhaps they 're just too busy trying to find the new meaning and the audience does n't understand
1,those who are familiar with this film should be ashamed to have
1,i have seen this movie countless times and
1,hayward was in the same scene as the one that had the character in
1,sometimes it seems that the director has a very good eye on his character in this movie
1,unfortunately this movie has to be made
1,not only did this show suck so badly i would never get
1,despite the low budget there 's also a good amount of action
1,by the end i was thinking oh that 's what the end of my life
1,this movie is just a bad movie
1,welles is also one of the finest directors
1,kelly is a good guy who does n't get to be a very likable guy
1,the movie is a good example of how the two men are in a different place and how different
1,i think that the best thing about this movie is how it is so bad and it 's
1,i think the best parts of this movie are when the main character gets involved
1,and there was one scene with the
1,you have to take it seriously for a few minutes of the movie but then i guess that 's all it does
1,i 've never really been a big fan of the
1,at least i think the story is very interesting in a way that i found a bit
1,when the first episode of season 2 came out i was a little sceptical about how the
1,even the soundtrack is n't even that good
1,i have no idea that this movie is not as
1,the only reason why this movie was so bad is when a film has its flaws and
1,as for the movie it was n't really a comedy
1,that would have been a lot more enjoyable if the story could have been
1,i have n't read anything from the novel that i 've read
1,these are the same jokes and the same actors who do n't even get a chance to get to know
1,and it is also a very good movie
1,the movie was made up a little too long for me but i
1,as the story begins to unfold in a somewhat implausible fashion the
1,not a bad plot idea and a bad movie
1,this movie has a very funny scene with
1,from the very opening sequence of shots to the last shot of the train the film 's only saving grace for
1,i'm sorry to say that i'm not a fan of the book but
1,cheap sets are n't really the same way the same the same footage is done in the
1,i do n't even want to give any other movie stars on the film
1,great story and a very strong story
1,guys and girls and i have to say that this is a great film
1,these are just plain bad examples
1,the first thing that struck me is that the film is a complete bore
1,i'm surprised at how many movies i 've seen in my life
1,wearing the same clothes on the back and the girl in a mask
1,whatever it is the director and the writer have
1,later the girl who played a child molester who was supposed to be a woman in her family was just another of a kind
1,many of the people in this show are so bad and so bad that they ca n't save this movie from getting
1,i have seen many other horror movies but this one was n't that
1,do we need to get to the end of the story and do n't have our hero 's family
1,to me this is a very interesting film with good intentions
1,when the main character 's character dies he becomes depressed with his friends
1,crime is n't a good thing and is n't bad
1,in the end the characters are just so stupid that you feel bad for their characters
1,i 've never heard of such a film or if it was n't that i thought to myself what it was all about was that the
1,however it is n't so much a movie as a study on the subject of racism
1,how can i describe this film as a comedy
1,it 's a shame the movie is n't as great
1,i have to agree with those who say that it is a good story with good direction and great direction
1,its a great film and i highly suggest everyone who
1,bottom line is that this is the worst film i have ever
1,out of nowhere the two of them have been in their twenties and have been in prison and they are
1,this is a great movie for you to see and enjoy
1,george sanders is an actor who could not be a better actor than a real villain
1,i was surprised that i did n't like it
1,it 's not even funny or even funny
1,he has a small and important role as a reporter
1,are there really noone who can enjoy the movie or
1,director john woo does not know what he 's doing and it is also very well made
1,besides being a big fan of the genre the
1,sam neill as always is excellent
1,similar to the first two films the first one and that is
1,maybe the director forgot the film and made it to the next generation
1,some have said this is a great movie and i do n't know how it got the highest ratings
1,by the end i was left wondering how much of the story
1,the film is very interesting to watch
1,the plot is a bit contrived and the plot itself is a little
1,oakie plays the role of a very very young woman
1,red skelton as a man who is a man who is not only in a few ways but also is the man
1,that 's why i did n't think this was one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen
1,the plot is a little thin and the plot is n't too interesting but it 's not a horror movie
1,a lot of this is the same
1,the film is set in the early seventies and early 70s as the title credits rolled out
1,perkins is the best actor in this
1,it 's an interesting film with great performances by the leads who are very likable but are very good and believable
1,however i do n't think i have a good time watching this movie
1,it 's a real treat to have a child who could have a child 's life
1,but it 's still worth it
1,i have seen better acting in my lifetime
1,the only thing i can think of was a movie that is supposed to have some laughs in it
1,so i think that was the intention of the film
1,this film is a total embarrassment to anyone in a coma or a person
1,it 's just so bad you ca n't help but laugh
1,this is a very funny movie
1,besides the fact that he was not
1,you 'll probably find it hard to believe a single person
1,if you do n't mind that in the end you will be able to relate with this film
1,i'm not a fan of the original story
1,can the director of the movie say that the director has made this movie a cult classic
1,the movie is about a bunch of girls who are sent to work for their honeymoon
1,what i got was a very good film
1,did they have a good time
1,it 's a shame because there really is n't much of a plot to speak
1,jackson was the most famous director of this film
1,above all a few years ago i have n't seen much of the same genre
1,an interesting story about a boy who is
1,this is the worst movie i 've
1,some of the best parts are the ones where the kids are
1,i'm not sure if it is the same
1,best of all is the music by the late
1,i was so excited at how many times it was canceled and i did not even remember seeing it
1,20 minutes of the film are just padding in one frame the
1,i think it was one of those films that you can see
1,but i guess i should say this
1,starting with a bit of a great story and an interesting premise
1,david duchovny as the villain is as good as his character 's and it makes him
1,morrow was the only reason i saw this film and did not think that the film would appeal to anyone
1,she 's a real talent but the rest of the supporting cast is very
1,besides the acting the story just is n't the best
1,find a movie that 's worth a watch if you
1,it is one of them the next year is one of the most underrated and funniest scenes in the film
1,the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are all likable
1,i have a hard time believing that the story is about people trying
1,they have to go to a party in a small town
1,so much for the movie the characters were believable
1,and then there was the music which was so
1,the first film of this movie is just a little bit of an adventure on the viewer 's face
1,nor does she know that her son is a woman and that she has been cheating
1,the only thing that i could have saved it from the movie was the acting but the movie had a decent plot
1,but it does have some funny moments
1,those who are familiar with the film are n't sure who the killer is
1,jose berger is great in the role of the villain
1,this time he 's not a bad guy and a little kid
1,the film has some nice scenes and the acting is great
1,call it an important movie is a mystery
1,even the actors who are the worst in any
1,despite this the movie is very much a very good movie
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this movie
1,ah i did n't know that it
1,a few scenes are filmed as though the actors in this film are n't going to have a clue of how
1,maybe i 'll just leave this movie to watch the rest
1,stealing the show and the movie is not even that funny
1,it 's an interesting idea of the story which has been written by a
1,first of all there is some very nice photography by john ford
1,with the help of his fellow colleagues he is able to make a good decision
1,the film is also a great vehicle for the film
1,i would n't have to watch it again
1,the story is n't bad at all although the acting and cinematography are terrible at best
1,well this one was n't bad either
1,so it 's a movie about an older brother
1,it was not a very good movie
1,this is not only a bad movie it is a very
1,but this is the kind of film to which the audience will be rewarded by the fact that the story takes place in the
1,the acting was ok but the acting was n't really good either
1,this was the first episode i saw
1,exceptions are the main problem with this movie and the casting
1,the film was a bit like the book but there were some good moments and some very good acting
1,if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend it
1,tracking down the movie is one of the best of the genre
1,just a bit of an odd thing
1,some of the other actors do a better job
1,another reason i give this movie a 10 because of the fact that this film was so poorly made that made me want
1,first i have to admit to the
1,very little of the time of the
1,i do n't know how it was possible but it was just not very good
1,a lot of these things are n't funny or funny but the movie does
1,plus i do n't think they should have had
1,if you are in a mood to watch this movie and
1,as it stands it seems like a big mistake of the
1,half of the time it seems that there are a few
1,the story is about a woman whose family is cheating
1,castle is one of the greatest horror
1,i would love to see this movie again
1,if you can make a film about the holocaust and the holocaust and you are looking to be good you
1,i have n't laughed once and i ca n't help but laugh
1,it is a shame that they did not have more money on the production of the original
1,and the film 's title is one of the most interesting
1,i have seen it three times and have watched it countless times
1,you have to wonder why the director has to
1,yet he has an extraordinary and sensitive sense of humor and a
1,compared to the other films i saw i would say that i
1,the script is a bit thin and is not even remotely original it is
1,based on a true story by the great john ford the film is a masterpiece
1,uzumaki is a film that is a bit long
1,we are left with a good feeling that this
1,the acting is n't that good but the story is really pretty good
1,since it was a long ago it was made for the advertisers and the people who were involved in the story
1,it 's not even a film it 's a waste of time
1,you will never get bored by this movie because it 's a bad movie
1,naturally this film 's a must see for any fan
1,i saw this film on a sunday afternoon in the summer and it
1,she is not a good actress
1,the story itself is very good and the acting superb
1,you know you are watching a bad movie that is n't even worth bothering to like
1,i think that this movie is a total failure
1,her husband is a young man who
1,and i do n't even think of it for a moment that 's supposed to be funny
1,stylistically it 's all a dream
1,but the movie does n't do anything that does not
1,i have no idea what the story behind the film is that i would n't be
1,i was a kid and had to watch the show to
1,now i am still a fan of the series and this movie was one of my favorites
1,nonetheless this movie is n't even good enough
1,too bad he did n't have a chance to
1,it 's just the kind of thing you would want to
1,this movie has a good premise but i have to admit i do n't
1,the film is a little slow to get
1,it 's not the first time you see a movie like this in
1,he was n't even a good actor but
1,character actor robert englund plays a young boy
1,the film is a great snapshot of the lives of the
1,she 's just a bit of a brat she 's not just a cute person that 's not a happy person who can
1,although it has no action and no plot no character development and it is n't a great movie
1,if that 's all i want to say about this film it 's not even worth the time
1,ok that 's right the main point of this movie is that it is
1,anyway if you do n't like to see it
1,why does the killer 's motives have been changed
1,it 's just not that great and i mean if there ever was a movie
1,not to mention the whole cast are
1,the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the
1,by the time it started i realized that
1,fraught with the most mundane and annoying dialog i 've seen in my life i 've seen the movie kazaam
1,the story is n't bad but it 's not even a horror movie
1,i have seen this film and i still
1,despite the title the movie is a bit long
1,jeanclaude van damme plays a character who has a very good sense of reality and is a bit of a jerk
1,you do n't even have any sympathy for the characters in a story
1,you can see it in the theater but this is what i
1,i would n't want to see this again but i have n't seen much of this
1,the first half is a great fun film that is a must see
1,combs is the only one who seems a
1,maybe it will help that the actors do n't have to be
1,it is a movie that is n't just as a comedy
1,i 've seen this movie twice and i do
1,the movie is n't that bad
1,i was hoping that someone would restore the ending of the movie as well but that is it
1,as with most films of this genre i was left wondering if they
1,lane and the rest of the cast are excellent but this one was just awful
1,when she gets a chance to go to the police to be reunited with the police she decides she wants to kill
1,told me the ending was the best i 've ever seen
1,i do n't want to say anything
1,jefferson is a young man whose only real contribution to the real estate is his family
1,perhaps the worst thing about this movie was the ending
1,she 's the main reason i have n't seen it so many times in a long long time
1,yeah i know that you are not gonna watch this film
1,besides being the most famous film i have seen and i 've seen a lot of films
1,another example of the kind of film that makes the viewer a
1,stanwyck has been a favorite actress since her oscar nomination
1,silly is the only thing that kept me interested in the story
1,sandeep levi 's character is so unlikable that it
1,apart from the fact that they have the right people they have to be a little prejudiced
1,the plot is so bad that it makes the movie more watchable
1,from the moment we learn about the man 's death it is not clear why he 's so attracted to his father
1,i 've watched the film numerous times since i was so bored and i did n't
1,the first half of this film is very slow
1,it is a shame that such a bad film is still on the list of worst actors ever
1,you will find yourself rooting for him and you will be disappointed
1,germany is n't all a bad movie
1,horribly directed badly scripted and acted as the worst
1,kind of like a lot of the other stuff
1,the plot is simple but it 's not enough to make you laugh
1,i would not be surprised if this is a remake of one of the great novels of the same subject but the film
1,ever since then i was surprised that she did not like it
1,after a few seconds of the film we get a lot
1,kyle and his friends have to be the most beautiful
1,yes there were some great moments but the story
1,with the exception of the first half of the movie there was a scene where the kids were talking and arguing about
1,only the acting and the script are very funny and this is a very enjoyable and enjoyable film
1,i have to say that this movie was great to watch
1,alec guinness has an incredible talent and he 's perfect here and he is a joy to watch
1,while this is one of the great movies of this period the film still is a must have for anyone who can
1,a lot of people seem like the only reason i gave the show a 3 is
1,do n't bother with this movie you 're not
1,the movie has a very good story
1,the only redeeming quality of the movie is the music
1,sometimes the movie has a few laughs and some really funny scenes
1,i do n't know why i do n't want
1,it 's a great performance and the film is a perfect example of how to make
1,the only thing that makes this film stand out is a good soundtrack by the legendary ennio morricone
1,the acting was good but the plot was so poor i could
1,a film that could not possibly be a masterpiece and a good example of how to do
1,at the end of the movie the movie is not only for the sake that the
1,maybe it would n't be the same as one of the greats
1,like the other two films this one has to rely more on the characters
1,not only that there is a very
1,and it 's not as bad as the first one
1,secondly the movie is very well made and well acted
1,when you are watching the movie you can get a good laugh from start to
1,revealing a lot of the characters in the film and it does not
1,this is one of those movies i like
1,what we have is a great film which makes a lot of sense and i hope the director
1,having been able to find something better about this show i was n't sure what it was all about
1,that 's not what i think the first time it 's not
1,the acting was so wooden and the plot was
1,if you are an old fan of the tv series or the first two films
1,that is what makes it stand up
1,these are two things i have never
1,then the movie is just about the worst thing
1,young men and women in the world is a very different place to the genre
1,screwball comedies were the first feature in the franchise series
1,more than a bit of a comedy
1,kathy bates is perfect as an old friend of a wealthy mother
1,i was expecting a lot more from this film but this was a good film
1,narnia 's a very interesting film
1,there are some funny moments in the movie which are just a little bit of a chuckle to me
1,the film also features an interesting plot that makes it all the more interesting to watch
1,though the film was made with the intention of a good deal of money it was
1,the movie starts out as a series of events
1,and then he is in the car and starts to play it again
1,david lynch is not a great actor
1,this film is just a poor excuse for a movie
1,basically the same story as the original and the original was a very interesting film
1,the first is that it has a very good plot and good performances by
1,it is a very simple movie that should be made to be
1,he 's also very funny in this movie
1,teddy roosevelt was the only one in the film that did n't seem to get
1,i was n't impressed with the movie because it was just too predictable at times
1,but i do not think it was a good idea
1,imagine a movie about this film in which it would be a waste of my
1,but this is one of my favorite movies
1,her performance is so wooden that i actually found myself nodding off
1,the plot is about an evil man named
1,our hero is the only one who does something right but the
1,a few of the jokes that come from the movie were n't funny
1,i do n't remember how to explain it but in fact it was n't the
1,instead they have a lot of sex with each other
1,it was the first time i saw it i was so
1,the only thing i can say about this was the acting
1,sure it 's a little too much for me to be scared but it
1,only if i could n't have imagined this i 'd have to
1,i have to say that i do
1,without much ado i was very disappointed
1,this movie is a waste of time and money
1,if you 're a fan of the original you can also enjoy this movie
