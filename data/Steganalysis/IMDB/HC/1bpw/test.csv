0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,introverted characters and situations that are n't even remotely funny

1,young man is a good film and it is a great film to watch
1,jennifer connelly plays the part of the mother and mother of the

1,why did they have such an awful idea of this
1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,how can a movie like this be released
1,if you 're looking for something to laugh at in a movie you should watch this one and do
1,and it 's not even the best movie i 've ever watched

1,he 's not the best actor he 's ever seen
1,it is not the best movie ever made but it 's a good film
1,i was n't expecting much of this film
1,sure the film is a bit slow and it 's
1,in fact the film is not as bad as it should
1,the film is a complete waste
1,if i were to rate it a zero i 'd say that the acting is so awful that it 's almost
1,seriously i think it was the best movie ever
1,they 're not the only ones who
1,the film is a bit slow but the story
1,the movie is about a young woman named seita played with a heart by a young woman
1,ok i know it was n't a bad movie but it is n't that good
1,we are supposed for a movie to get a little more attention than the first

1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture and
1,he 's a very good guy and a very funny
1,the film is a complete mess
1,imagined as the first movie i was impressed by the story
1,the movie is about the power and the
1,sigh the movie was n't so bad it 's good
1,kidman 's character is a little too much for me
1,the film has some good moments and some good acting
1,the film is about the same thing about a
1,if you want to watch a movie about a group that has a lot of money then this is the movie to
1,there are some very funny scenes in the film
1,if i were to rate it a 1 it should be a 10
1,but it 's a great film
1,emmanuelle chriqui plays the role as the mother of a young woman who is in love with her
1,in the end the movie is a very good one
1,ever the movie 's biggest flaw is that the story is not very
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie but i was
1,but it 's a great film
1,and the ending was a bit too predictable and the story is just plain
1,guy kibbee plays a man with no charisma and a sense that the film 's only purpose is that it 's not even a comedy
1,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,there are some very good scenes in this movie and it is
1,but the movie is not a complete
1,final thoughts are the best of the movie and it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen but it 's a good movie
1,the movie was a waste of time and i would have to agree with the reviewer who said it 's not a bad film
1,is it the same way that the same old lady who plays the girl in
1,it is not a film for the
1,of all the movies i 've seen this one has the feeling of a great
1,but the film is a bit too long
1,clive owen plays a very good guy
1,instead it is an excellent movie
1,emil 's character was so stupid and the plot is just so ridiculous
1,in the first film he is the one who has the ability of
1,it is a very funny movie and i
1,the film has some good points but the story is
1,trust me i did not see the film at
1,this is the worst movie ever made
1,it is a very good film and it is not a movie that i
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't believe that it would be so
1,ok so i was n't impressed

1,uncle sam is a very funny and funny film
1,i was n't impressed by this film

1,documentarian is the most annoying person i 've ever heard of this film
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the acting and direction are all excellent and it 's not a good film
1,even the most ardent of characters are not funny

1,it 's not even a movie it
1,i have seen this film twice
1,when i first heard of it on the shelf i thought it was

1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's one of the best i have ever seen

1,a few years ago i saw the film and was
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit too long
1,this is a very bad film and i do n't know why
1,to be honest i was n't expecting a lot
1,rosanna arquette plays a young woman in a small rural village who has a crush on the young woman
1,even though it 's a bit dated it is still a very enjoyable film and a good time capsule
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film but it is very entertaining
1,tommy lee curtis is the perfect choice to make this film
1,so the movie is about a young woman named caroline who is sent to a mental hospital where she is a teenager

1,fourth the plot is a bit confusing
1,another thing i did not like about

1,but it 's a good movie
1,dear god this movie is a complete mess of a
1,thursday night is one that i would love for a few years
1,but the movie was n't so bad that
1,i was surprised that this film did not have the
1,in the first movie the main character is the father of a man who is a very human being
1,it is a very funny movie
1,most people have seen this film and i do not think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,she is the one to do and the film does n't seem very
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the pleasure to see but i
1,above the rest of this film i have to say i was n't
1,oh yeah and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,way too much of the same territory as the
1,stage fright was a great movie for me and my friends and i were watching this movie for the second time
1,diana rigg is a great actor
1,also i do n't know what the point of this film was to be
1,up until the last scene of this movie i was expecting something more than i
1,i have to say i was n't disappointed
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to watch and it was a shame that it
1,sutherland 's character is a caricature
1,the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are all likable and likable and
1,you know what i was going through the whole movie and it 's
1,due for the sake that it is not a movie that is n't afraid to be a good movie
1,i was surprised that the movie did not get a theatrical dvd
1,walker 's character is a little too unlikable to be believable but he is a little more than he is
1,the movie is about the same subject as a book and it
1,properly i have to say that this movie was a complete waste
1,and it is not the worst film i
1,she 's not the only person who
1,i have seen this movie twice and i still have to admit that i have n't read the novel
1,so the movie was a waste
1,they are all very funny and funny and i really enjoyed the movie
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,despite the obvious plot holes and the occasional sex
1,very good movie and a great movie to
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's a great film
1,this is the worst film ever made
1,another problem is the ending which is so bad that i actually found myself nodding to the screen
1,in fact it 's a very good film and a
1,he 's a very good guy and a very funny
1,malfique was one of the best films i have ever seen
1,the film is a bit of an action movie but the action is n't too bright and the movie is n't really a thriller it is n't even
1,there is no real plot to be found here and
1,the film is a complete mess
1,mr bean has the ability of a character to play the role
1,it is not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you should see this
1,you know that the film is a bit too long
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in the world to be a part of the family and
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money to watch
1,as for me i have seen a lot worse
1,i have seen this film twice and i have never been a
1,otherwise the movie was a bit slow and boring but it 's
1,it 's not a movie that is n't funny
1,these are the only reasons i gave this film
1,sadly it is not a film that will appeal to anyone who has ever
1,we have to be careful to see the movie
1,the film has some of its most
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,one thing i did like about this movie was that it had
1,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i did not like the film as much as the first
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget movie
1,evie 's character was so annoying that i could n't care less about the characters or their motivations or
1,possibly the worst movie ever made
1,for the most part the movie was pretty bad and i was bored
1,okay so i do n't think that the film was a total success
1,although the film was a bit slow it was n't a good film either
1,this movie is not a good one
1,his character was so annoying that it could have been so funny
1,i was n't expecting much from this
1,the movie was a waste for the whole family and it was n't even worth watching for the first time and the
1,the film has some of the most

1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money to waste
1,this is the first movie that i
1,not to say the movie is a bit of a bore but it is a very good movie
1,plenty of people who are n't in this movie
1,this movie is not for the squeamish
1,in fact it is a very good film and it 's not just a movie it is an
1,this is a very bad film
1,why did they make such a bad movie out of this mess
1,i have to say that i was very impressed with the movie and i think it 's the best movie ever made and it is one
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i was surprised to see that the film was a bit slow
1,barney is the best of the bunch
1,on the other side of my mind i found this
1,also the film has a lot of good things to do with it and it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a small budget and the acting is pretty bad but it is n't
1,maybe it 's because the movie is so good that i could n't help but laugh at
1,if i had n't been a fan of this movie it would have been a good film to watch
1,true the movie was a little too long for the first two parts but it 's a bit slow moving and the ending is a bit unsatisfying and
1,but the movie was a little slow and the ending was too abrupt
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film
1,it 's not a movie for the masses or for the faint
1,her performance in the film was a little overdone but the story was very good and the acting was good
1,each of the three leads are a bunch of friends who have a lot
1,in fact it is not the worst movie i 've seen
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune to see
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,indeed the movie has some very good moments and is very funny
1,who is that girl who is the killer in this film and she is the one
1,the film is a bit of a mess
1,in fact it is not the worst movie ever
1,let me say that this movie was so awful that it was actually painful
1,yet the film is a little too long for the
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,the film is about the same thing as the first one
1,if you want a good laugh and enjoy a good movie with a great
1,if you 're a diehard horror fan you 'll love it but it is n't a bad movie
1,all in all this is one of the
1,it is a shame that this movie has n't received a wide release in the imdb
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was born
1,however i was n't impressed with the film
1,oh and a lot of people who are not in the
1,gus van sant 's direction was a
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,you can tell the story is a bit
1,but the film is not as bad
1,despite the obvious plot holes and some very good acting this movie
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,and it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
1,news reports of the film are the same as the first one and that is the only reason i can see it
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have to rely
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and it is a very good film to see
1,maybe it was a good idea but it
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i was surprised that it was n't a
1,an excellent film that is a mustsee for all ages and for fans who enjoy the genre of the late 1960s
1,this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of seeing
1,its not a good movie but it 's not a good movie
1,just like the first movie i have to admit i did n't have a clue about what i saw but it was a good idea
1,will smith and the other characters are so bad
1,the film has a very interesting plot but the acting and
1,a few of them were very funny and i liked them but i was n't sure what to
1,the movie is about a group that is trying too hard
1,although i do n't think it is a great movie it is not
1,he 's a great actor and he is very good as a man who has to be a little too hard
1,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release in
1,the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who has a daughter and a son
1,on a technical level the acting was superb and the story
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world where they are not afraid of being a child and
1,when the film is over the end credits have to
1,this movie was so bad that i could not even laugh
1,or maybe the fact that it was a long way to make it a little more interesting
1,from the opening sequence to the end of the
1,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and too predictable to make it
1,while i was not expecting a good film i did not like this one as it is very much like the first one
1,please please do not waste your money
1,that 's the only thing i have ever heard
1,no matter how many years ago he was a big star and
1,but the film is a little slow
1,generally the film has a lot to offer
1,there are a few good scenes but the film is n't as bad as it could 've been and the script is so bad that i ca all about
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good one and it
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this movie
1,also the movie is not as good as the first one but the acting was so bad it 's almost laughable
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but i did n't like the movie
1,then there 's a scene in the middle of the
1,mastroianni is the best actor in this film
1,same goes with the rest of it
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and time
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and it was a bit of a stretch to see the movie
1,but it is a great movie and it is a great movie
1,seven years ago i was a teenager in the late 20s and early seventies
1,amusingly it 's not even the slightest bit scary it 's a bit of a mess
1,sure it 's not the best film i 've seen but it is a great film
1,the film is about the struggle of the two
1,how can you go wrong with the movie
1,but the film is a bit slow and the ending was so predictable
1,oh and the music is n't bad
1,it 's not even a movie it
1,it 's a very good movie
1,so the movie was made for the sake that the film
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is superb and the story line is very good
1,despite the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight location it was a nice touch
1,when i first saw this film i was a bit sceptical of the film and the fact it
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this movie and i was surprised to find out
1,the movie is about the same subject as a movie
1,it 's not even the best of the series
1,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,i was surprised to see this film
1,the movie was shot in the same way as the first film
1,dr hackenstein has been a big hit for years and now has been on the run for his life in a small village
1,but it is not the best of the series
1,to be honest the film is a little
1,if i had to watch it again it was n't
1,i was n't impressed by this film but it was very good and it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a group that has been sent into a world war camp in
1,she 's a little more convincing and a lot more than she 's
1,there is a lot to be said about this
1,what a waste for a movie that
1,i was surprised to see that the film was made for
1,in fact the film was shot in the early seventies
1,ricco 's character was a little too unlikable to be believable but the story was so stupid that i was n't expecting much
1,anyway the film has a lot to offer and
1,but it is not a movie
1,every time i watch this movie it is so sad to see a movie that is not even close
1,not to say that it was a bad film but i did n't expect much
1,it 's a shame because the film is so boring and so boring that it 's hard
1,it is not the best movie ever made
1,the film is a complete mess of the original
1,however i was surprised that the movie did not get released
1,well i guess i 'll be a little more forgiving of the movie
1,with a few twists and turns and some of them you can see the similarities between them and the characters are so
1,the film has a lot of potential to make it worth watching but the movie does
1,i have seen the movie and i have to admit i was
1,what is the point of this movie
1,this movie is not a good one
1,it 's a shame that the film has been so much
1,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,also the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too long for the whole movie
1,from the beginning of this film i was a little confused
1,you can tell the story is a joke but it 's a good movie
1,if you want a good laugh out loud comedy
1,this is a movie for everyone
1,timothy spall plays the role of the father of a
1,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,they are all very good actors and actresses
1,connery 's performance is the only one that i can recall him as a man who was a bit of an
1,david lynch 's film was a great film that i enjoyed
1,plus the movie was a bit too slow
1,whilst the film was shot in the seventies it 's not a movie that you can see in the cinema
1,a lot of people have said that the movie is so boring and so stupid that i could n't even get
1,luckily the film 's biggest success was that the director had
1,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,first of the film 's plot is about a young woman who has been kidnapped and abused by a woman
1,phoebe 's father and son have a relationship with each other and
1,in fact the film is a bit too long for the most extreme of the movie to be a complete mess
1,that is what makes it a great movie and it 's not just
1,she is the only person that has to be killed
1,that is what i thought it was
1,with the exception being a bit of the same thing i did not like the film and the plot is
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
1,this movie is not a good movie
1,this movie was so bad that it
1,so i guess it was a good idea
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and money to make
1,or the fact it 's not the best of the bunch
1,part 2 is a great movie that i think is one
1,she 's a very talented actress
1,from a technical standpoint this is the best movie of the decade
1,michael caine is the only actor in the movie that is good
1,simple story about the lives of the people who were in love
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed
1,and it 's a good movie
1,cartman 's father is a man who has
1,my advice is that you 'll find this film on video
1,do n't worry about the movie because you
1,it 's a very funny movie and it 's not just the fact that the movie is set in a small city in new
1,compelled for the movie 's success
1,let me say this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune
1,this movie was so awful that i was compelled to watch the whole movie
1,to be honest the movie was n't so much of an improvement on me
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,insights to be a great movie
1,keira knightly is a good choice for her
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was a complete disaster
1,no one has to endure the film
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money
1,it is a very funny movie
1,then the movie starts with a bang and a few scenes of the movie are shot
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and the acting is superb
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie
1,in fact the only thing that makes this film is the fact it is a film about a young man who is attracted
1,but it is not the worst movie i
1,like the first film the characters are so stupid and the plot is so contrived
1,unless you are a diehard fan like myself and have seen it in a few years i 'd say
1,however the film is not as good as it should be
1,having seen this film several times and have watched it
1,but it 's not a good movie and it is not
1,it is a very good movie and i think that the movie is very well
1,however i was n't impressed with the film
1,pranks are n't always a problem
1,unfortunately the film is a bit too long for its own good
1,she 's not a bad guy but a good actress
1,yvonne 's character was a little too much to bear
1,maybe the movie was made in the early 70 's
1,michael caine plays a young man who is diagnosed with his past and is forced by his family to find a new job
1,in the end the movie is not a good
1,ford is a great actor and i have to say
1,also i think that the director should have had the director 's commentary on this film as
1,it is a very good movie and it 's a great movie to see
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,however the movie was a little too long
1,yeah it 's not a bad film but the fact that it 's
1,she 's a little more convincing and she 's not the only person
1,but it 's a good thing to watch
1,wolf 's character was a little bit too much for me
1,damon crowe plays the role of the father who is a little too old to play the part
1,this is the worst film i 've seen in years
1,if i had to watch it again i would have been a little sceptical
1,and it is a shame because the film is a little slow
1,scarlett is a very good character and she is very believable in her portrayal of the character
1,some people say that this is the best movie ever made and i
1,the film is about the same thing as the other films
1,in fact the only reason i watched this film was that the actors were so
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,they 're all in a bad movie and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got
1,eleanor parker is the perfect actress for her role
1,can you say the movie is n't bad it 's just
1,the film is about the struggle between the two and
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised that the movie did n't have a lot to offer
1,80 minutes of the movie that you will have a good
1,we have to be a bit more careful about
1,valjean is the only person who is able in the world to get his revenge
1,the film has a very good story line
1,with the help from his friend he 's a little too much to be ashamed
1,there are some good scenes and some good ones
1,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,i'm a big fan of the genre and i have seen
1,bad acting bad direction bad editing
1,just as a movie is a good idea to make a good
1,hitchcock 's film has been a staple of
1,4 out of 5 stars for the acting
1,not to mention the acting is horrible
1,okay so i was expecting a lot more than i expected
1,once again the movie has a very interesting story
1,you can see the movie in a different light
1,scott 's performance is very good and the movie has some good moments
1,when the movie was released it was released in theaters
1,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,and it is not a movie that is so much better than the first
1,or the other two of them are the same

1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but it was very entertaining and
1,what a waste of time and money

1,it 's a shame because it is not the best movie ever made
1,the film is about a young woman named
1,if i had to give this a zero i would have
1,thinking about the film and the fact it is
1,examples of the film are the fact that the director has no clue how to make a movie
1,this is a movie that i can watch over all
1,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,both the story of the film is very good
1,funny and entertaining but it 's a
1,he is a very talented actor and a very good
1,there is a lot of violence in the film but it is
1,alberto de la bestia is one of those films where you have to
1,however the film is a bit slow and boring
1,we are not supposed for the same reason
1,on the plus the acting was pretty bad
1,one of the most interesting films of the last century and the most successful and successful film
1,it 's not even a movie it
1,ted danson plays the role as a cocky and cynical man who is
1,closed to a point of nausea is the story
1,our hero is a very good actor and he is very convincing in the role of the detective
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen by anyone who has seen the original
1,see it for the acting and the acting it is very well done and well worth seeing
1,i was surprised to find that this was the first movie that i saw that i would n't
1,i was surprised that the movie did not have a chance for
1,this movie is not for everyone
1,i was n't expecting much from the film but it 's not a good film
1,ginger rogers is the only reason i can think of why this movie was made in the uk when the film is not a masterpiece
1,but it is not the worst film i have seen
1,then there is a lot more to the story than the characters and their motivations and actions
1,he is a very good actor and he is a great director and a good guy
1,it 's not a movie that is n't funny
1,there are a few good moments in this movie but it 's
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first movie and the second is a very poor one at
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen
1,the film has some of the most
1,bring a new generation of kids and children
1,the movie was shot on location and the camera
1,just like the first film i have seen this movie
1,plus it 's a shame that this film has n't made any sense to me
1,what a great movie this was
1,the film has some good points but it 's
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this film and
1,i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
1,and the movie was so bad that it was actually funny
1,ok i have seen this movie several years ago
1,the movie is about a group of people trying to find their
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to me and the acting
1,i have to say that this is a great film and i recommend it for
1,starting in a small town in the country where the young girl has
1,for the most part the acting is superb
1,everyone else in the cast including a cameo by john wayne as a drunken
1,the film is about a young man who has
1,at the end the movie ends with a very abrupt climax that is n't really explained at the beginning of the movie
1,some of the scenes were so funny that i could
1,other reviewers here seem to be saying that this is a very bad movie but
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and have seen a lot more of them
1,other reviewers here have said this movie was so awful it was almost
1,another thing i noticed is that it was a complete waste of my time
1,in the first film the main characters were the ones who were the ones who had been in love with the girl and the mother who was the
1,the film has some of its moments that make it hard to understand why it is so hard for me to watch it again
1,helen mirren plays the mother who has to be the mother to the end
1,sometimes it is a little too slow but it is n't a good film
1,in fact the only reason i gave this movie 2 out was because it had a rating of 0 stars
1,that 's what i got from this film
1,this movie was so bad it was good to see the actors playing the characters
1,elizabeth hurley plays the part with a smile
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the acting and direction is very
1,why is this film rated r for violence and language
1,it 's a shame because it is a very bad film and it 's not even worth mentioning
1,if i were to give this movie a 1 out of ten it is a good film to be seen
1,however i was n't impressed by the film
1,i have seen the movie twice
1,throw the two together in the same time
1,lori is a very beautiful woman who has been a fan for years and has been in a relationship for a long time
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,in the end the film is a bit of a mess but the story is very good
1,alec baldwin is the perfect actor for this role
1,a few years ago i was a little disappointed
1,sorry to say i did not like
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and a woman but it 's a good movie
1,i was n't impressed with this film
1,in the first movie he was a little too old to play a role in this
1,and it 's a shame because it 's not a good movie to begin to
1,each character is a caricature and the story
1,like the other reviewers i have seen this film and i do not
1,but the film is a little slow and boring
1,a few years later i saw the movie on the
1,im a fan and i do not know how this film is going for the same
1,oh yeah i do concede that this is the best
1,anyone who thinks that the movie is supposed to be a comedy is a bit of a joke
1,anyway i have seen a lot worse movies
1,material is n't a good thing but the movie is a little slow
1,so i was expecting a good film but this one was
1,there are some very funny moments but it 's not
1,there is no reason to see this film
1,why did n't he try and make the film
1,it is not the best movie ever made
1,could have done without the aid
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting was pretty bad
1,the film is a complete waste
1,the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled

1,i have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of the
1,it 's a very funny film
1,the movie is about a group of young men who have a relationship together
1,this movie was a waste for the first two minutes
1,i was surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical dvd release but it 's
1,the film has a very good story line and a great cast
1,i have to say that this is a very good film
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,in the first film the characters are not very likable
1,pitching the same story and the same characters as in the first one
1,since the film was made for the first half of the film it was a
1,it 's not a bad film but the acting and the acting are so bad it 's funny to see them
1,and the movie was a complete mess
1,since the film is a bit too much for a thriller it 's a bit too long and it is not
1,no matter what the cost of this film is it 's a waste
1,now i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie
1,if you 're a fan like me and have a good sense to
1,a lot more of the same
1,the film is about a group that has been sent to a remote island where they are hunted down by a group that is a gateway of the earth to find the
1,but it 's a good thing to see this
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but it 's worth seeing for
1,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,robert englund was a good choice to show the
1,karen is the one who is n't the one who is in love with her
1,a few years later the movie was made and it 's a very funny film
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture and
1,after a few years i was n't able into the film and the film was n't as bad
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie but
1,like the first movie i thought that the movie was pretty good and the acting was pretty decent
1,and the movie is so bad that it is n't funny
1,the film is about the same subject matter and it 's not a movie
1,only the first time he is in a film is a good idea to make it
1,alert to the film 's plot the film is a bit slow and drags on
1,i was surprised to see that this movie is not a
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have
1,he is a very good actor and a very good actor but
1,the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a man in the woods
1,look for the scene in the movie when
1,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,twins and dolls is one of the most boring movies i have ever had to endure
1,five years later i saw this movie and it was a very pleasant surprise to watch and
1,young man who is a little too old to play a game is a good idea
1,not only is it a bad film it 's not even
1,hey i do n't know what to say
1,from a very young woman to the woman who is a woman who has been in love with a woman she is a very beautiful and very beautiful young man who is married
1,ms and the stranger are all in love
1,saif khan plays a very likable character who has to be the best actor ever
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,you know that it is n't going to get a 10
1,fled from the prison and the other two men in the film are the
1,so the movie was made in the first place
1,i was n't impressed with this film
1,remade by the bbc and a few other commentators who have commented about this movie the movie has been made
1,this movie is a must for anyone who likes to watch movies
1,if i had to watch this movie again i would n't be able
1,but it is a good movie
1,the film has a lot of potential to make a movie that is n't a good movie but the acting is pretty good
1,it is not a movie for the
1,it 's a shame because it 's not the best of all the movies
1,for the most part it 's a little slow and boring
1,walking around in the woods is a film about the power and tribulations of the two people
1,they 're not the only one to survive the
1,yes the movie was a bit too long
1,and it 's a good movie to watch
1,colonel is a man who is trying too hard and is a little over his head
1,which i thought was the worst film ever made
1,the movie is about the power of a man who is a woman
1,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little unsatisfying but it is
1,but the film is a bit too long for me to
1,day is a movie that is n't even a comedy and is a movie that is n't
1,your average movie goer will enjoy it and you 'll enjoy it
1,as a result of the fact that it is a movie that is n't even
1,while the movie was a little bit slow it was still very good and
1,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood film
1,this is the worst film ever
1,so the movie was made in the first half hour and
1,most people are n't even aware that the film is not as
1,but it 's not the best movie ever
1,avoid this one at any cost
1,the film is about the same thing as the first movie
1,it is a very funny movie and i
1,denzel is the only person that is able in the movie
1,it is not a film for everyone who wants a good laugh and a good laugh at it
1,i was surprised to see this film
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but it was a great film and i would definitely recommend it to anyone
1,the film is a complete waste
1,the movie was a waste of time
1,murphy 's performance is the only reason to watch the film
1,dracula 's curse of the dead man 's body was
1,the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb and it 's a shame
1,that is the only reason why i gave this film a 2 instead of 1
1,so i guess it 's a good thing
1,she 's a very good actor and
1,with a supposed beard in his head the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,yakima canutt is a great director
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,the film has some good points but the rest is a little too long
1,overall this is a great film
1,that is what i think of this film
1,its a shame because the movie was
1,even the actors who are so bad are good and the movie is very
1,it is not the best film ever made
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a little too long
1,if you 're a fan of horror films you will probably enjoy it but it
1,terence stamp is a great actor
1,on a technical note the acting is superb
1,a few years ago i saw the film and was
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but it was n't
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i 've ever seen in a movie
1,it is a shame because the movie
1,from the beginning of the movie the viewer is treated with the
1,despite the obvious plot holes and some of them it 's not
1,humor and drama are the only things i
1,it is not a film for the
1,in fact the film was a little slow and the ending
1,i was surprised that the movie did not get a theatrical dvd
1,classe 's performance is a little stiff but he
1,but the movie is a little too slow and boring
1,he 's a great director and he has a
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but the acting and direction are so
1,if i were to rate this movie a 1 i would have rated it a 1
1,secondly the movie was n't bad enough to be a good film but the actors were
1,that 's what makes it a great film and a good movie to see
1,not to mention that it was a complete waste of money and money and time spent
1,the film has some good points but the story is
1,as a matter of fact the film is not a complete waste
1,there is no real plot to be told in the movie
1,a lot of the scenes are shot and edited
1,unfortunately it is not the case
1,i have seen this film twice
1,the film has a lot to offer and is a great film to watch
1,highly recommend this movie to everyone
1,if i were to give this movie a 1 i would
1,there is no real reason for the existence to come
1,people are n't going to be able
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has been sent into the world by his father to
1,the film is about a young woman who has been living in the past
1,the film has some good moments and the story is a
1,if you 're looking for something that is a bit of an insult you 'll probably be bored to death
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,this is the worst film i have seen
1,do n't worry about this film it 's a waste
1,like the other reviewers here said that this is one that is n't even worth a look
1,of course there is no need to be a part in the movie
1,filmed on a shoestring in the early 1900 's this film
1,all the characters are all very good
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance for me
1,it is not a film for the

1,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a film about
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new
1,yes the film is a bit slow
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,other than that the film is pretty good and it 's a good
1,one of my favorite films of all times
1,the film has a very good cast
1,anyway i have seen this movie several years ago
1,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,we have to be careful of the story
1,anybody who has ever seen a film that is a little bit of a jerk and has a lot of experience
1,light and shadow are the best
1,the film is a complete mess
1,while the film was a bit slow at first i thought that the movie was a little slow
1,as for the rest i would say it was a good
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,this movie is not for the faint of heart
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get a good idea of the movie but it is
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that has no plot
1,but it is not the worst movie i
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and it was n't a good movie
1,every time he 's on screen he is just a jerk
1,this movie is a must for anyone who wants to see something like
1,but the movie is a little too slow and boring for a while and it is n't even that bad it 's just plain bad
1,there are some very funny scenes and some of
1,days of the dead is a very entertaining movie
1,of course the movie has some of its most memorable moments and it 's not just
1,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood film with
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,being a fan of this movie it was a waste of time
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but for those who enjoy the first two films you will enjoy it more than the average
1,if i had n't seen the movie it would be a little more interesting to see the film
1,not to mention the acting was terrible and the plot is so bad that i actually laughed at it and i
1,and the movie is so boring
1,i was surprised that this film was made
1,as a result of this movie i was very impressed by this movie
1,izo is a very entertaining film that is not just
1,it 's a very funny film and a great one at that
1,ms and her boyfriend 's sister is the
1,thus the movie is a complete mess of the original
1,they are not even funny and the story is so bad that you can actually laugh
1,the film has a very good cast
1,her character is so annoying and so stupid it
1,i have seen the movie and it 's not a bad thing to say
1,without a doubt the best movie i 've seen in years
1,as for the rest i would say it 's not that good but the movie was pretty bad
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have seen in
1,especially when you consider that it 's a good thing to say that the film is
1,if i had n't seen the movie it would have been much better
1,one of my favorites was that the movie is a bit too slow and too predictable
1,he 's a very good guy
1,salsa 's character was so annoying that it could have easily
1,this is the first movie that has a very
1,and the movie was a complete mess of the original film
1,with the exception being the last scene of a young woman in a nightclub she is a little too old to play a role
1,everything about it is just plain awful
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the original
1,this is the worst film ever
1,even though it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen it 's a waste of my time
1,match is the best movie i have ever
1,if you want a good laugh and a laugh at the end then this movie will make
1,these two are not the same as
1,other reviewers here have commented that the film is a
1,has the movie makers aspire that the movie is not about the war
1,her performance is a bit too stiff
1,i have to admit i did n't like this movie
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and have n't seen this film you 'll probably
1,however i do not recommend it
1,the movie was shot in a very
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen
1,this movie is a must see for anyone who loves action
1,following a group that has been a big hit for the first year of the year the film begins to fall apart
1,second the film was a bit slow and the ending was predictable but the ending was so unexpected and so predictable that
1,ms and her husband is a little more than a couple
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,woody harrelson plays the role of a
1,the film is a complete mess
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of nowhere
1,though the movie was a bit slow it did not make it any easier
1,through a few minutes of the movie we see the two men who are in the middle and end of the world and the two men who
1,there is no reason to see the film
1,i'm a fan and i do n't know how this film was made but
1,the film is a complete mess
1,she 's not a bad guy but a good actress
1,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,the film is about a young woman named
1,stone is a very good actor and i have seen many
1,the movie was shot in a small town in the early seventies and the film is set up
1,if i were to give this a 1 rating i would give it a 0
1,all the characters are all likable
1,the film has a lot to do but the story does not work
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending was too predictable and too abrupt
1,but it is a great film and i recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh
1,a few of the actors were very well chosen
1,marky 's mother and the son of
1,who is that knocking off the head
1,however i was n't expecting a good movie
1,but it 's a great film and a good one at that
1,or maybe it was a mistake
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,this is the first film i 've seen in my entire lifetime
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to
1,whilst the film was a bit slow it was a little slow at times and the ending seemed to be a little too
1,a lot more of a good movie than this one
1,but the film is a bit too slow and the
1,someone who has a crush in his life is a little too much for him to get to know the
1,it 's a very good movie
1,in fact the only thing i liked about the film was that it had to be a
1,john goodman is a great director and i hope he will
1,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,i have seen this movie several years ago
1,both the story and characters are very good and it is a very good movie
1,it is not the best film i have seen in a long time
1,we are supposed to believe that the film is not a good idea for the movie but it 's not as good as
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie
1,its a shame that the movie is n't so much a remake as a sequel to the book
1,the film has a lot of potential and the acting was pretty good but the script is n't bad enough
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard in a film
1,it is a very good movie and it is a shame that the film is not available on video or
1,the movie is about the power of the human
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i did not like it at all
1,then the film switches to a scene where the hero 's character goes on to the next scene
1,plagued by a very funny and funny script by david lynch
1,i have seen this film several years ago and i still have
1,indeed the movie has a very nice
1,the film is a complete mess
1,plus it is a very good movie
1,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,great movie and i recommend you watch it to
1,beginning of a movie that is n't even worth a look
1,it is not the worst film ever but the fact remains it 's not even a movie it 's a waste of your money
1,either way the movie was so good that it made me laugh out loud
1,read a book about the real life of the killer and you 'll see what the movie is about and
1,the film has some of the most
1,sure the movie was a bit slow and it was not
1,this is a movie that is not only a comedy it is a drama
1,bad acting bad script bad acting bad editing bad music
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,apparently this movie is not a movie
1,anyway the film is a little too slow for the
1,faith domergue is the best actress of all times
1,and it is a shame that the movie
1,a lot more of the film 's characters and the plot
1,this is the first movie that i
1,of course there is a scene in the movie where a man who has a crush in
1,the film has some of its moments but the film does
1,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking to watch a good film about a man who is a good person you should be sure
1,for a movie about a man 's journey into the
1,but the movie is not a good movie
1,folks do n't get it wrong i do not want to give it away
1,then the movie switches to the end
1,i have to admit that the film was a bit slow at times but i found the story very intriguing
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete waste of time
1,there is a lot to be learned about the movie
1,a few years later i was able to see the film
1,he is the most annoying character in
1,snider is the only one to be killed in a car crash and he 's not a big fan of
1,after a few years i was n't able into this film as i did
1,watching the film i felt like i was in the minority
1,it 's a shame that this film has not been available on dvd
1,when the movie is about to be a good movie it is not
1,two men are killed by a mysterious maniac
1,garage wrecks and the other is a very good film
1,what a waste for a movie that
1,one of the best movies i 've ever seen and i 've ever seen a movie that is so bad it is funny
1,if you 're a fan like myself and you 're a fan you 'll be able
1,the movie was a waste for the whole family and i would recommend this movie to any fan
1,this is the worst movie ever made
1,they are all very funny and funny and the movie is very funny
1,jodhaa akbar was a great movie
1,another thing i did n't like was the fact it was a little too much
1,and the ending was so bad
1,she is the one who has to
1,another problem is the lack thereof
1,besides that the movie was a complete mess of the original
1,this movie was so awful that it
1,lucy 's performance was so good that
1,no one has ever heard about it
1,several of the scenes are so funny and so funny
1,proving that he was a great actor and a great actor
1,all in all this is one that should have been made
1,you can see that the actors are not going
1,at least the film was a little too much for me
1,this is the first movie i 've
1,this movie is not for everyone
1,sure it is a bit of an action movie but the action scenes are very good and the action scenes are pretty
1,just as a movie it is a very good film and it
1,the movie is about a young woman named caroline played with her younger
1,or the fact that the movie is a complete waste of time and time and time to
1,not to say that it was n't bad
1,at the same moment the film is a bit
1,this is a very bad movie and i do n't think it
1,10 the acting is n't that good
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is a great movie
1,yet the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,martin landau plays the role as the villain who is the hero
1,as for the acting it 's not a good movie but it 's

1,hotel rwanda is one that is not a
1,upon the death of his mother he decides that he is the only one to survive
1,sam waterston is a good choice for this role
1,the film has some of the most

1,from a very young woman to a woman
1,soon after a long shot in a bar he is forced to leave and he is a little crazier than the rest
1,classy and funny the film has a lot to offer and
1,the movie was shot on location in a small town

1,emulating this movie it is not that bad but the acting was horrible
1,ursula 's character is a little too unlikable and
1,still it is a good film to see and enjoy and enjoy and a great family
1,a lot more than a little of a fan of this genre i have to say that the
1,despite being a fan of this movie i was expecting a lot more
1,when i saw this movie on the shelf i was looking for something to watch
1,the film is a bit slow but the acting and direction is superb and the story
1,however i do not think this is a great
1,audiences who are not familiar to the original series are the ones who have n't seen
1,preston is the best actor in this film and it 's a shame he never got more recognition
1,this is a very bad film
1,he 's not the best actor in
1,pointless and boring and the movie has a very
1,robert downey sr is the perfect choice to play a character who is a very good actor and
1,gem is a movie about a young man who has been a struggling man
1,now i know i 've seen a lot of bad movies but i have to admit i
1,matthew modine plays the part of the young man in the film
1,mort is the best character in this film
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first film and the first
1,even the actors are not very convincing
1,some people have said that this is the best film ever made and it
1,none of these things really happened
1,this movie was so awful that it
1,however i was surprised to find out that the film was a little too long

1,i have to admit that the film was a little slow at times but it was n't too much of an action film
1,the movie is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by her father and
1,at the same moment the movie is a little slow but the
1,franco nero is a genius and the film has an excellent cast and a great cast including
1,a lot of the film 's plot is about the same thing as the original
1,it is not the best movie i have seen but it 's not a bad movie either
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust or the history of the christ but it 's a good film
1,she 's a little more than she bargained for

1,it is not the best movie i have ever had to sit through

1,additionally it 's not the worst film ever
1,pretentious plot and characters are introduced as a whole
1,even the most diehard of the film 's characters is not a complete cipher and it 's not a good idea to have a movie that has been done in a way that makes it hard for
1,one of the best films of the year and one of the most underrated movies of
1,jack frost 2 was one that i would n't want
1,the film has some good points and is very good
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,fifty years later i saw the film and was amazed at
1,sorry but i do n't think that this movie was a

1,in the first movie he was the one who was the one who had
1,the movie is about the same thing about the same old man who is
1,too bad the movie is so boring and so boring that it 's hard not to like it but i do not think
1,it is not a film that will
1,angie dickinson plays the mother who is a little too much of an
1,probably a little more of the same for this film
1,with the exception of a couple of the actors in the film the
1,boris karloff plays a very likable character
1,plus the movie was a little slow
1,first of the film 's title is a little bit too long

1,a few of the scenes were shot on a very
1,the film has a very interesting story line and the characters and their
1,if you want to watch a film that is so good you 'll be disappointed
1,as for me i was impressed with this film
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't
1,there are a lot more to the film than the original but the film does not make
1,despite the fact that the film is a little bit of a bore the film does n't

1,i was surprised that the film was made in a time
1,to me it was the best movie of all time and it was a joy

1,instead it is an insult to the director and the director for making the movie a bit too much for the viewer to care

1,being a big budget movie fan i was disappointed by this film
1,i was n't impressed by the movie

1,while the movie was n't a complete waste of time it was a very enjoyable film
1,the movie is about a young man who is a man who has a son and is a very
1,lying in the middle of nowhere and the two of the girls are the two
1,the film has a lot of action in it
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into a series
1,it is a shame that this movie has been released
1,and the movie is so bad it makes you wonder if it 's a joke
1,how could you possibly get the chance to see
1,as a matter of view the movie is very good
1,spoilers ahead the film has some nice moments but it 's just
1,this is the worst film ever
1,walken 's character is a caricature
1,macdonald 's character is a bit of an
1,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and too abrupt to make me want my
1,apparently the film is n't a complete waste of time and a complete failure
1,it 's a very funny film and a good
1,she 's a little more convincing than she is
1,the film has a lot of action in it and it is a bit of an
1,like the other reviewer said this is the best movie i have ever seen
1,is this a good thing to do
1,the movie is about the same subject as a movie
1,maybe the director should be able for the film 's shortcomings
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in at the very
1,someone else is a little too young and the story line is so predictable
1,this is the worst film i 've seen in years
1,unfortunately it is not the same as a movie
1,the film is about a group of people who have been living in the past for a while and they are all alone
1,when i saw the trailer for this film i was very excited
1,additionally the movie is a little too slow for me
1,mad max was the first film i saw in the theater and was very disappointed in it
1,after the movie was over the movie was a little too much
1,i'm not a big big fan of movies but this movie
1,it is not a film that is not for everyone
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie
1,was this a bad movie or a bad
1,even though the movie is a bit slow at
1,recommended to those who enjoy the genre and are not interested with the story or
1,barry bostwick plays a very good character
1,for the first half hour i thought it was going to end
1,also i think the movie was very well made
1,the movie was a waste of time and money
1,curse of a doubt a film that is not only a comedy but a comedy and a comedy that 's
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in a hurry
1,just like a movie about the same subject matter and a few things that make you think
1,tyrone bergman 's performance was excellent and
1,after the movie was over the top i had to see it
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a good story
1,jenny 's character is a bit dim and the film
1,i have seen the original movie and i can safely tell you that this is
1,a lot of people are talking about the film
1,even the most ardent of the actors and actresses are not the best
1,i'm not a fan but this is a very bad film
1,who is that knocking out of a window and a car
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film
1,overall the movie is very good and the
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell you that i was a little surprised that i had n't heard about
1,yes the film was a bit slow but the story is so simple
1,we are supposed to be a little more forgiving of the story but it 's not a good movie
1,the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman in the woods and is forced by her mother to be a
1,cook is a very talented actor and i have
1,it is a shame that this film is not available on video
1,the film has some good points and some of the scenes are very funny but it 's not
1,that is what makes it so great
1,this is the worst movie ever
1,the movie was a bit of a mess
1,tatiana is a great character actress
1,has a lot to do with the movie
1,in the first movie the main character is the father
1,it is a shame that this film has n't been available in the uk for years to end
1,but the film 's main problem is that the story does n't seem
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film
1,never before have i seen a film that is
1,when i first saw this movie on tv i was very excited
1,indeed the film has a very nice
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't so
1,just like the other reviewer said that the movie is not a comedy it 's a drama
1,the film has some of its most
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie but it
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised to find out
1,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,about a year ago he has been a teenager
1,i was n't impressed by this film
1,the film has some of the worst acting i 've
1,just like the first film the characters were
1,additionally the film is not a comedy
1,it is a very good movie
1,through the movie the viewer feels like we 're going through a lot of flashbacks
1,it is not the worst film i 've ever seen but i 've seen it all
1,i have to say that this is one that i would recommend watching for
1,it 's not a movie that is n't a complete mess but
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,before i saw the movie the movie seemed very interesting and it
1,none the more i assure you you 're going for a good time
1,the movie was shot in the same way as a
1,even though it 's not a good movie it is still a
1,my favorite part of the film was the ending
1,you can see the movie in the first place
1,this movie is not a good movie but a very
1,terrible movie that was n't made in
1,still the movie is a bit too long
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by this movie and it was a very good film to see
1,all the characters are all very likable
1,this is a very good film and it 's not just the story that
1,in fact the film is a bit slow and the ending is too abrupt and too predictable to be true to
1,a few years ago the movie is about the same thing as the other two movies i 've seen in my life and
1,the film is a bit of an action film but the story itself was so good that i was n't expecting much from it
1,then the movie switches to a very bad ending and it 's not even that bad
1,unlike most of his films the film is not a very good film
1,one of my favorites was the fact the movie is set in the same location as
1,a lot of the scenes are filmed with a handheld camera
1,i was surprised to find out the movie was made for tv and it was n't a good idea
1,i was surprised to see that this movie is not available on dvd or vhs release of
1,the film has some of its moments that are not funny
1,lead by a very talented actor who plays the part with a very good voice
1,from the beginning of this movie you know that it is n't going for the best
1,i have to admit that the movie was a bit slow but i found
1,it is a shame because it 's a great movie
1,unfortunately the film is a little too
1,hayworth is the only reason i can think of why she 's such a good actress and her character
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed with this film and
1,i have seen the movie and it 's not even that good
1,the movie is about a young woman named seita who has been kidnapped by a man
1,that is what i thought it was
1,and the ending was so stupid that it
1,you can see that the actors were trying to
1,spoofing this film is the acting of a very young denzel lewis
1,while the film was shot in the seventies and the early seventies and the late 1960s
1,so i guess it 's a good thing that the film
1,instead it 's a very boring film that does n't have
1,if you 're a fan of horror films and have seen the original you will probably
1,when the movie was released i thought that it would be good but i did not
1,you know that the film has a very low rating
1,after a while the movie becomes more of an exercise into a series
1,starring a young woman who is in the middle of a
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,it is a shame that this movie has been released
1,with a supposed beard and a few exceptions it 's a very nice film to watch
1,i have to say i did not like this film
1,in the end the film has no real plot
1,not only is it a complete mess it 's a total waste of time and time
1,first off the acting was terrible
1,a lot of people are complaining that the film
1,but it 's a good thing to watch and
1,the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped and sentenced by his family
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish it
1,it is a shame that the film is not as bad as it should be but it is still very entertaining
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted by a woman to be a witch
1,the movie was shot in the same location as a
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously
1,guess that it is n't a good
1,why did they make this film so bad that it was so awful that
1,you know what i was going through
1,yes it 's not that great but it 's not a bad movie
1,frankly the movie is a bit too long
1,the film has a very good story line and a great cast
1,so the film has its charms and
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie
1,another thing that is missing was that it was n't a comedy or
1,its a very funny movie and i really liked it
1,like i said the movie was n't bad but it
1,well the film was a bit too long for me but it 's a good movie
1,i have seen the movie twice
1,the film is a bit of a mess but the story is a little weak
1,i have seen the movie twice
1,getting a lot more money to watch
1,this is a very bad movie and i would have to agree that the movie was n't bad
1,then there 's the fact that the movie is a bit
1,if you 're a fan of horror films and you have seen this film you should definitely
1,all in all this movie was a disappointment
1,a few years later the movie was made
1,the movie was shot in a very
1,i have seen the movie and it is one that i
1,as for the acting it 's a bit too bad that the film
1,well the film is a bit of an action movie but it 's a bit too slow and too slow for a
1,but it 's not a good film
1,they are all in a different place and the film is not a complete waste of time and time
1,15 minutes into the film i realized that the movie would be good but it was n't that bad
1,and the movie was so bad that it made
1,there is a lot of violence in the movie
1,add a lot of action to a movie
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete insult
1,as for me it was n't a good movie but i
1,it is a shame that this film has been made available on dvd and it 's available
1,they 're not the same as they are
1,the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who has a crush in her life
1,it 's a shame that this film has not been released theatrically
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and it 's not
1,if i were n't for a few minutes of the film i 'd probably have a little more patience to watch
1,everyone is a bit too old to play the part of the game but the film
1,honestly the film is a bit slow and boring but it is n't a good film
1,for a film about the evils and tribulations of the people involved with the movie
1,but the film is not as good
1,the film has some good points and is a
1,it is a very funny film
1,i have to admit i did not like this film but it was a great film
1,thus i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,jcvd 's performance is the only reason to
1,while the film was shot in a very limited location it is a film about the holocaust of
1,and it is not a good movie
1,the film has some of the worst acting i 've
1,when i saw the movie i was very impressed with it
1,unfortunately it is n't a movie that is
1,the film is about the same thing as the first one
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film
1,mandy moore plays the role as the mother
1,how can you go wrong with the idea of this film
1,so i guess i was n't going for the
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that it 's not even a comedy
1,and the ending is so stupid and stupid that i was surprised to find
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is not as bad as the original but it
1,i was n't expecting much from the film but i was expecting something more
1,so i guess it was n't the first time i watched this movie
1,a few years later i saw this film and it was the first time i saw it
1,things get worse when they get the chance to get
1,freddy 's character is the best thing in the movie and he is the only one that is really good
1,there is a scene in which a man is stabbed
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,and the movie is a bit of
1,there is no reason for this movie to be made available on dvd
1,the film has a very good cast
1,anne heche plays a young girl who
1,i'm not sure why i did n't see this movie
1,we are not told that the movie is a good movie but it 's not
1,however the film is not as good as it should have been but the film
1,in fact the only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was a little too long
1,of course there are some very funny moments in the film
1,another problem with this movie was the lack that one character development
1,well i do not think this is the best of all the films that have made it
1,this is the first movie that i
1,and it 's not even the worst movie ever made it
1,alienation is the key to the movie and
1,four years later i was a teenager in the late sixties
1,in the first film the main characters are a group of friends who have been living
1,however the film is not as good and the performances are n't as
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,he 's a great actor and he is a good actor
1,given that this movie was a complete disaster i was n't sure whether it was a bad
1,all in all a great movie to see
1,i was surprised to find out that this was the
1,it is not a film that is n't a comedy
1,every scene is shot with the camera and lighting and the camera work and editing is
1,willie is the only person who has a shred to him and he 's not even a very good person
1,this movie is a must for all lovers of horror cinema
1,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her and her family
1,however the film is a little slow and
1,the film is a complete mess
1,but it is not a good film
1,far more entertaining and enjoyable than most of its predecessors and it
1,it 's a very funny movie and it 's not just a movie
1,unfortunately it 's not the worst film ever made
1,but it is not a movie that you can watch
1,the film is about a young man who is a teenager who is trying to find his wife and is now married
1,after the movie i was a little confused about it and it 's a good movie
1,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,the film is a complete mess
1,you can tell the director was trying too much
1,it 's not even a good film
1,soon the movie is set up to get a little more
1,so the film is a bit of
1,while the movie is a bit long it is still very good
1,it 's a very good film and a good example of how to
1,the film is about a group that is
1,this is the first movie that has a good cast
1,bill paxton is the only actor in this film who has
1,in fact it 's not even a movie
1,both of them have been a staple in the film
1,anyway the movie is n't bad but the story is n't bad
1,charlie is the one that is n't
1,it is a very funny movie and i
1,like i mentioned earlier the movie was very well made and i think it 's a great movie to watch
1,instead of a movie about a young man
1,as for the rest i would have given this a zero but it 's not a good movie to
1,the movie is about the power of the characters and the relationships that
1,it is not the worst movie i have seen but i 've seen it all the way through and
1,there is a lot of violence in the film but the
1,so the film has a very good cast and a good cast but it is
1,long before the film 's title the film has a lot of potential
1,from the opening sequence to a final showdown between the two leads to a very
1,although i have n't seen it since i was a kid i had
1,tim robbins plays the part of a very good character and he is a great
1,never mind that this movie was made in the first
1,we are not supposed for the same thing to be said about
1,not only does it have to have been a little over
1,a few years later the movie is
1,save your money and watch the original instead of the big
1,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 90
1,no one is a good person but the fact is this movie has no real
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't released in theaters and
1,story line and acting is a joke
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that it 's not funny it 's just
1,i have seen the original version and it 's
1,actor and director of this film is a very good actor and
1,he is the only person who has a crush on the man who
1,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,i have seen this film several times
1,but the film is a little slow and boring and
1,scarlett is a great actress and she is very convincing
1,i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
1,we have a very young man who is a very good guy
1,i was surprised to see this film
1,the film is about the same subject matter as the first film
1,canadian cinema has a lot to do but this one was just
1,bad acting bad script and bad directing make it hard to believe
1,the film is about the same thing about a
1,but the movie is not as good as it is in this one and
1,and the movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
1,will the director please tell us how the film is supposed
1,immediately the movie is set in the middle and the end of the movie
1,margaret is a very good character and the story line was very interesting and the characters were believable
1,perhaps the most memorable scene is when the two roommates meet up
1,i have seen this film twice and it 's not even worth the wait
1,but the movie is not a good movie it
1,the movie was shot in a small budget and it was n't a movie that
1,w the first film was a great movie that was made in the late 1990 's and was very well made and acted and acted
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it is hard
1,the film has some good points and some of them are good
1,after the movie i was a little skeptical about it
1,the film is about a group of young people
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the film does n't have a good story
1,it is a shame because it 's not a bad film
1,whitaker is a great actor but the rest is a bit stiff
1,this movie is a complete mess of a movie that i would n't even recommend
1,length is a bit of a mess
1,not only is the acting atrocious the story is awful
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i did n't expect it
1,personally i think that this movie is
1,you can tell the director was aiming for the actors to be in it
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,i have to admit i did not like the movie
1,when the film was released i was surprised that the film had been released in theaters
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to begin
1,if you want to watch a movie about a bunch of people you should watch the movie
1,his character was so stupid and the plot was unbelievable
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was a bad man and he had to fight for the first half
1,it is not a film that will
1,it is not a film that will
1,on a technical note it is a great film to
1,there is a scene in which the girl is lying in a room with her
1,an excellent cast of characters that are n't
1,i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting was good but i did not expect it to be so bad
1,hell i do not think that this movie is
1,of course the movie is a bit too much to ask for but the story line was so bad that i could not believe that
1,all the characters were so bad that
1,if i had n't been in a coma i would have been a little confused
1,frustrated and insecure and a bit too much of an
1,the movie was a waste of time and i would n't recommend it
1,correct to the end i felt that
1,douglas fairbanks jr and his wife were both very funny
1,back then it 's a little bit too much for me to enjoy
1,cushing is a good guy and he is
1,besides the acting and the plot it is
1,but the film 's main flaw is that the story itself was n't very good and the characters are
1,he 's not a good guy
1,but the movie is not as good
1,produced in a way of life by the director and his own wife and his
1,there are a few moments of brilliance in this movie that are n't
1,as for the acting it 's a little bit of a stretch to sit through
1,if you 're looking for something that 's a bit more than a few hours you will
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i was n't impressed
1,also i think that the director should have had the director and writer of the film to make it more interesting to watch
1,everything is illuminated and the movie is a mess of a movie
1,some people say that the movie was a little too long for the first two thirds but it 's
1,we have a lot of people in the theater who have no idea what they 're
1,she is a very good actor
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie
1,wow this is the worst film i 've ever seen and it is not even close
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt and the movie is n't even worth mentioning the ending
1,you can see that the actors are not the same
1,be prepared for the best and the worst
1,big brother is the perfect guy
1,i have to say that i was n't disappointed
1,starring a cast that includes the likes of robert duvall and john carradine
1,so the film is not as good and the performances are n't as bad
1,it is not a movie that you
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie
1,charles grodin plays a young man who
1,a few years ago the film was made in the uk and it 's not even the same
1,she 's not the only one who
1,at the end of the movie the audience is treated to
1,for the most of the movie i have seen a few movies and this is the one i have seen
1,she is a great actress and she
1,but it 's not a good movie and the acting is terrible
1,but it 's a good movie and it is a great movie
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new
1,an excellent film with a very good cast
1,she is the only one to be able to find her way to a woman
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,it is not a film that will
1,while i was n't expecting much of the movie to be a horror film i did
1,each of these films are the most popular ones
1,he is the most talented actor of
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that it was a remake of a
1,her performance in this movie is a little overdone but the acting and the story are all very good
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,gregg araki is the best of all
1,still it 's a great film
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't so
1,neil labute is a master in the genre and the film is very good
1,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,the film has a lot to offer but the story itself is very weak and it 's not a bad movie either
1,and it is a shame that the movie
1,where the film is concerned with the fact that the film
1,afterwards the movie has been done by a bunch of friends who have a lot to do with their lives and their lives
1,a few years later the movie is
1,bibleman 's character is the most interesting and
1,the film has some good moments and the story is very good but it
1,neither of these actors ever did a great performance
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that it is n't the same
1,to be honest the film is not a total disaster but it
1,she 's a very talented actress
1,shame on the director for giving us the most memorable scene in which he
1,he 's a very good actor and a great actor
1,while i do not like the movie it is still very entertaining
1,but it 's not a good film and it 's not a good one either
1,i have seen the original version and it is very good
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,with a few exceptions the movie is a complete waste of my time
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it 's not
1,i have seen the movie twice
1,ostensibly it 's a movie about the life and death that it
1,he 's a great actor but his performance is not very good
1,it is a shame that the film is not available in dvd
1,ps i do n't know what the point was
1,based upon a true incident of the book the movie is a very interesting one and a very interesting and moving experience
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,films like this are not the best
1,however i was surprised to see the movie was
1,special mention must be made of the director 's vision
1,watched this movie and i was amazed that it was n't even released on
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,okay so the movie was a little too much for
1,these are two of my favorite movies of the 90 year
1,the film has some of the most
1,the film has a very good cast
1,and it is not the best movie ever made but the
1,first of all i have no idea what to say
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his son but i was not disappointed
1,having seen the first movie the first one i thought that this was the
1,opting to be discovered by the director and his cronies who have
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring
1,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,finally the film 's plot is about the
1,plus it 's a very funny movie and it 's a shame because it 's a great movie to see if you can find a good movie that you have n't
1,really it 's not a movie for the masses or for the faint hearted or otherwise it 's a good movie to see
1,thankfully it is a little bit too long
1,unlike the first movie this one was a complete waste
1,suddenly he is forced to go on a killing spree and the remaining suspect of his own
1,whatever the case i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting is n't bad
1,quite frankly the movie is not as good and the performances
1,the film is a complete mess
1,taylor 's performance in the movie is very good
1,and it is not a movie
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the original
1,an excellent cast of actors and actresses who
1,the film is about a young man named krishna who has a son who has been in the
1,a few years later i saw this film on tv and was very disappointed
1,in the first film the characters were very different from their counterparts
1,i was surprised to see that this was a movie that was made for the sole reason
1,you can tell the story of the
1,at the end of the movie the audience was
