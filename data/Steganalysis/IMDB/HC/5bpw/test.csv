0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,the movie would probably not have made a lot of money at all
1,here we do n't know that he is a talented guy but the person responsible for the death of his wife and his daughter both with the same sort of true love and loyalty and desire and
1,the film is n't quite as good as the earlier american werewolf movie and in my opinion it should have gotten a wide release
1,i mean i did not expect a lot of jokes
1,about this show that is being done with only 5 episodes of the first
1,i found it difficult to believe it
1,both the leads and the actors could n't be even more convincing in their presence as we should have given them so the script should have been shot in a very
1,the only thing this movie has going it was the original story is n't in the same class as it did
1,otherwise it seems a little bit too long though
1,shocks are not quite good but the film is not about the world it 's just glorified
1,from the first sequence one which really seems more of an anticlimax for the viewer 's face at times
1,i think the problem with this production version is the music
1,oh he 's just plain boring
1,you might ask if the director of the movie had done more research
1,the movie was a great disappointment to me to watch that kind
1,allot of time in history was taken for granted
1,all the acting was good too
1,brings the right mix of fantasy movies into a movie and you 'll get an enjoyable movie
1,once upon his arrival she was murdered off by some men to have some other people and then he did that and she never knew her about to
1,but for this show it just seemed less realistic
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,and in any way it 's a little silly
1,through all his lines with an accent like the movie which are a lot more interesting and more powerful than
1,this film is a big disappointment in the history of the modern and contemporary
1,the acting is generally poor and you 're not a fan either
1,the movie is about a guy named rudy a cop that he gets his exwife 's son of a car driver
1,this flick is one for children and fans of the 1940s watch it for laughs and the ones
1,let 's make it clear that the director and screenwriter really wanted to make the same movie so it 's easy to distinguish
1,romantic comedy a movie i have seen a few times over before
1,moments of dialogue were funny the storyline was so funny the jokes were funny
1,practically certainly a must watch for any fan of japanese cinema or for its own great entertainment factor for those interested or in an old
1,watch with a bunch a man holding out a gun
1,lines that we have the requisite hero do n't realize is that it is always and he does n't seem to be the person who always believes that the
1,and this movie does deliver a good performance
1,i would like to give him a credit which is
1,there are numerous scenes that are n't too memorable or too obvious
1,i 'd also like to see more of
1,blah blah blah blah blah this video is also so fake i ca n't stop
1,so the two men do something like that
1,this film is not a bad film
1,presumably it was n't a typical film i was
1,this movie however was made about three
1,i mean yeah it 's the old and the new kid the man with the screaming girl
1,i really think we need to find a better film that has a strong character an interesting story line and good action sequences
1,i ca only give this film a 10
1,well the story does n't have any suspense
1,sadly the filmmakers do have the same exact problems and they are so hard on this one that i really wonder for myself even that this is
1,she has an amazing portrayal and it makes it
1,my only criticism would get a few positive reviews across it
1,i think they could have made it a better movie
1,the music is n't that bad and is so bad they are terrible in anything
1,so why is there enough time spent on these peoples' first project in this series when they
1,another story about the plight of a bunch of teenagers at the
1,unfortunately this movie is the worst thing i have witnessed for in my
1,the acting is poor and they do so by giving a
1,the director 's chair is the best i can find it a perfect job of a film
1,it 's a shame that this film fails
1,the result is a very funny action film that keeps your attention especially
1,she 's in the movie but does the
1,clara 's death is just not as good as it will ever be
1,410 the movie is just so bad i am sure u know what if someone does this thing is soooo stupid
1,she was a good looking child as her older sister
1,the plot was not very interesting or interesting i just think
1,but it is worth watching the first few minutes and then get back to it
1,this film lacks the usual charm inherent and it is more to the point in
1,by the end you did n't know what was going so you might be surprised with the ending as soon an example of the ending coming up
1,there 's also some of its trademark moments as it tries too hard to emulate what they do with it 's running time
1,performances were good and the movie was very well paced
1,it 's just plain awful and a waste story that could have been made the same guy from the original book
1,we have a movie filled with so much profanity and cleverness
1,there was so many ways in the world that should be so obvious in the end
1,i ca all be a big fan so when i
1,once again the acting in these roles was very good and this movie got
1,directed by mark paxton and directed it by some pretty good supporting actors in the supporting role with a bit of their usual action and a few decent parts
1,spongebob is a real talent because it made much more sense
1,i would recommend this movie as a whole
1,and then he becomes involved with a local mob agent who is responsible for his treatment on drugs
1,we see it as a great movie and it 's one that you will never tire of for not being in the least bit
1,the story line is pretty decent and if only not the acting
1,if you want to see it try to compare it to the original
1,great performances by all his cast and as mentioned above and over i also hated that one of the more powerful films i have ever seen a young girl 's husband who
1,with all its foibles and sincerity in the first movie i 've never seen anything so unique yet again
1,the acting in this movie are also a poor stiff soap and a young aspiring one as the lead character
1,and the only real standout of this kind was minghella
1,the performances were really bad particularly from a technical performance that was
1,but if i was the one that kept the film for its own lack to work it should be made i enjoyed seeing how the director would get out of
1,you know the film is over and you know the drill just makes it
1,after the funeral at the beach that he did n't have to take the car from the car
1,later i bought the movie version because it was so bad
1,and of course what happens is the
1,i thought it was going down the line
1,then suddenly the movie turns out to turn into a giant worm as his family has no plans for it
1,the director of the classic film is just the right word to describe this film
1,the first few moments are good
1,and that can be said about the story in which the story is based and the way that
1,there are some funny parts with the actors
1,it seemed to me that he was trying too much and
1,kathy richardson is superb as prince and emma sarandon
1,jack oakie is a welcome addition into making a film in which he appears like an innocent and naive actor
1,if you like action movies i liked that too much
1,this is one film i did n't care at first
1,despite the title this is the story of an evil scientist and the man from the wrong
1,i really like the way the movie is made
1,i can watch this over and over again and still do n't care
1,the film is a comedy from start
1,unlike the other characters in this movie you will have a very difficult relationship with the
1,the movie is a tribute of an older woman named sophie to be a major role in
1,the acting in any of these actors could n't deliver more
1,come on this film has no substance
1,we know who who is who is that
1,that 's what the movie is all about
1,the film itself is a work and is not
1,for example as she takes on a job she claims to have stolen her from a mental institution
1,i also noticed that the film has a lot of money and its presence has been released for a lot of viewers
1,who knows the kind this thing is and why
1,it 's really all a lot
1,also starring joe don sullivan as the bad guy and the other in a cameo appearance
1,there are the other two actresses whom i could
1,yeah i guess i am going to write a review here
1,oddly enough this is one 's first film and i do hope i was able
1,besides my love and understanding of the same film in the way she portrays the women she is a bit difficult
1,what 's with the characters in the first 10 minutes of this
1,i have been waiting to view this movie since i saw a screening on
1,the script is just the kind you are watching but after the main characters you 'll know nothing about what
1,although it 's quite obvious that the writer and director decided to make something original and interesting
1,how is it possible that someone who does not like this type or even if i would like a movie
1,the movie is a collection that makes it a real pleasure to watch
1,the main character a little bit more than
1,first of all the cinematography was very poor
1,i'm glad they did n't make a great comedy because of this time
1,william shatner has a long hair down in a wooden little movie in his early career
1,from the beginning the series looks like a home video and the camera is very slow
1,another thing that i liked about it came across the first film that the ending was good
1,morris is a very real man and in this movie he can see the whole enterprise as he tries to act like
1,this film has some excellent sequences and is actually much much better at this
1,or it 's my personal favorite
1,alongside the movie was a little corny with the actors
1,if you 've been interested in watching this movie and you are looking forward to
1,nobody is even close up with any sense of suspense or atmosphere
1,the only reason i give this movie is because it 's a bit of an 80 on a scale
1,neve bennett was great in it
1,what were the chances of making it to dvd
1,the ending was very good especially the
1,so to make a movie worse then the first but never to go back into a nightmare
1,joe is also a great leader of the city and so he is unable to communicate with them
1,i love all things considered wrong
1,all in one a complete waste for the complete turkey of this movie
1,the movie opens with a good old fashioned ending that makes me want to know what to do
1,cleanliness is a film you should love and enjoy if you like this type of movie
1,let this show go to hell so the bad guys do not deserve it
1,some viewers seem to be aware of what exactly is happening in the movie the two siblings
1,since the movie was only in about twenty min and it was shot on a tight budget and that it was a movie
1,i also loved the idea that the movie was trying so hard that it was hard for me because it did n't make sense
1,i found it a little more than a comedy
1,people like chris penn are more interested
1,some spoilers to the rest of the movie are ok too bad it 's not going near the level that other people have seen
1,so the ending has all that it needs
1,this is one of the most beautiful things in the film
1,overall this was an awful film
1,i 've always been in the minority of these guys
1,if you want good acting by a script you must see the
1,this film is one hell for those who have a
1,dixon does n't show up for the most memorable character and he makes up the bulk of his
1,i think you could get to see the movie without ever watching it and you have one of those films where there is a great actor playing the part of a woman but when you
1,only to find a way to turn it into an utterly
1,yes it 's a little bit scary
1,his performance by this movie is great
1,after a while this show was the best thing i have to offer and it 's the worst
1,i am glad i had seen the book i am a tad picky
1,others can understand it from all the above
1,there was a bit of humour and there were a few jokes like that where the kids should have been treated as a stupid laugh
1,and in many ways this movie does nothing with no substance
1,what 's not to like about the character of the boy 's life
1,there is also a lot more to the film
1,i am not a big fan of
1,nope like those in the first category the ending is pretty lame and unnecessary but really it leaves an impression of
1,futuristic is a real shame because of the positive review i found here
1,guess that this is the most underrated film of all times
1,the movie is basically just about what the critics have to pay off
1,it was one of the most enjoyable
1,she also becomes suspicious after a brief prologue in which she seems that she has a severe sexual appetite
1,these are minor children in the history of the modern cinema
1,and the main character looks good on paper and so is mr
1,you 'd do well know what these guys had
1,amadeus is not an easy task but they work perfectly together and the film itself has excellent production quality
1,lloyd does not seem very interesting in this movie
1,a film about a new man was made into one of films that
1,the characters that were never seen before and the very first thing was in a real conversation
1,i can remember when i was a kid at blockbuster
1,i 've never thought of any tv movie i can remember which
1,i know we are seeing those actors and that all is really great in every
1,the other was so much much better than most horror fans in
1,consequently he 's so convincing it 's not to take lightly to him and if anything this
1,perhaps a few of you will appreciate
1,some may find some funny moments here but that also does some fine songs
1,erika eleniak delivers a surprisingly strong performance as a reporter who is in love with her
1,but in this case the movie is a very interesting one
1,my advice is that a movie based solely on the subject of a film
1,these were some people in hollywood who were never sure why this movie is made up of a real person called tnt or a black man
1,the movie was full of crap so i did n't give this show a chance and it would be an interesting movie
1,the film also plays one part for a reason
1,as the movie goes on her career as well on her first wife 's birthday and even has a bit more screen form than the movie itself and she
1,and yet at the beginning you know of an evil villain
1,as a big time film fan i would love it to be in my collection but i just did not buy it and
1,demme and his colleagues are always an old lady and she is also able to do anything with them to survive so often with her body that is all about
1,little erin does n't really like her mother until she sees a young man brutally abusing
1,this is a great show for the show it is all its own
1,on some of the comments this movie has made it 's rated r rating pg13
1,and then the two main character in the movie just happens to be the story of a woman who lives
1,where that movie failed me was the inclusion of a very unique and
1,the acting ranges without a word and a few of the actors were just
1,as a fan of that type period and culture this is just awful
1,really this is a very beautiful movie
1,in that respect there also is no mention or message to the narrative of the film it feels very amateurish because it is impossible to
1,that 's too little for a movie not even that
1,hitokiri 's attempt to capture the essence but i can understand why the people
1,whoever wrote this should be warned of this film
1,i have seen that film a hundred and so often so
1,it 's a waste of time and money i spent the entire time
1,i 've never seen better than this film
1,it 's a shame that i saw every copy of his movies on dvd or read
1,really the plot is very thin
1,the most interesting aspect of watching this movie was its lack of respect and understanding in what
1,anyone who knows something about animals that are just a bunch will be no other member then just plain god
1,how did the guy know how to make this dribble of a classic
1,stunning score by franz desplat and is the finest film of all time
1,the movie is so stupid i can almost believe it
1,maybe that 's what it seems to have been and what
1,afterward it would have made the film more exciting
1,i'm sorry not to mention the horrible acting and
1,cue the story of love and courage between reality in a good way
1,in a nutshell a movie like this that was released theatrically and then had so many negative stars
1,the last segment with the famous guy getting a job does n't make sense in the most hilarious way
1,on a side of this one where i can see this series of events about it being a complete departure from other episodes i thought
1,on the other hand i have not seen much at least
1,this film is so bad it 's hilarious the worst aspect of it is the
1,of fact the film is not in the same league as the original but the film does n't have any sense of place in the end
1,but i can also remember that they did that
1,for me the film 's most powerful climax is the way they both resolve themselves by their families in a way that 's also somewhat reminiscent
1,unfortunately this was all done in a film that looks too good
1,it 's the film that i would like to see on my own personal tv of all time' the movie is still about a good one and it is
1,i know the first person who says that no matter how pitiful i am and that 's what makes them great
1,strangely however a lot of what it really is an action movie a must on any old movie to be made but at
1,and as the story unfolds it becomes a mystery and the whole series
1,tweety in the hat is one of my favourite books ever
1,well the movie takes over an eternity to make
1,i was waiting to be eagerly frustrated but it was n't and the whole movie just made you want
1,and he gives one of the most memorable scenes he has
1,problem with the film is the characters all their actions were lost in a
1,occasionally they look even too expensive to be funny
1,the plot is n't exactly all that
1,winkler is perfectly cast as the slimy young lieutenant who is not quite interesting looking as he has with his life
1,as is usual the first 20 episodes where the plot is set up and the film ends it does not
1,it 's a shame that it had no money in store
1,st and then the whole thing is in place on the spot of the local bar where the only thing that transpired it must be so much fun and the way it works
1,i really enjoyed the special features and the music was n't good
1,all those elements of the movie did n't really fit together in the movie
1,intertwined by the director and writer robert r r i thought it would be a fun ride
1,now i can only assume that the director knew exactly who i got this idea and a lot
1,chuck norris stars as lt john mcclane the leader of a group on an emergency mission
1,this movie is so much better than any other movie released on
1,arau 's direction of the film also feels authentic
1,none of the characters seemed to be any likable character they tried to be in this movie without much of
1,that 's because i was bored by the way it was shot to the point of a complete and total lack of action
1,just how you are looking for such an amazing actor
1,truthfully the film is not too bad for it 's time and there is also much more than a story of vengeance which is almost impossible to
1,the plot is not so good it 's almost impossible but it can never become a
1,if the actors were supposed as being on their way
1,this film is not without its faults
1,but here 's the plot and some
1,the movie was so bad that it deserved a razzie award for this piece on imdb on imdb in
1,it 's a shame to see a film that did not have to be taken seriously
1,i found the movie in a very boring pace
1,there is n't always a sequel
1,do the rest of my family 's request at all cost a movie
1,i think i will see more episodes from the
1,shots were shot in real life with different locations of different places and that was more of such a poor script and acting
1,towards the same time the music was a complete ripoff too and even the soundtrack is rather
1,i would rather choose to get away a few more times and give to a friend of them and i would
1,in the last couple of years the movie 's director david vincent had some great ideas in this film which include one actor in the other hand who also is the
1,thankfully for all involved i guess that was the director of the new version it took too much to make out that he was the best thing i have seen
1,our hero 's daughter has the audacity of the man that his mother died when
1,the script is a fine mixture to the classic horror genre and a
1,the acting is wooden and even the music is horrible considering the
1,finally after having a few beers to them i'm just convinced the
1,the result is a very slow boring movie
1,while the movie is quite good and interesting there is something about it
1,he 's a cop and he is
1,the movie is great fun to watch it 's humor and the acting it all is great
1,the rest i watched over the years i watched a few episodes of the season
1,i thought that this would probably really be a classic film but it 's a tad of
1,the film 's success is for the two
1,though the film has a few weaknesses for it the plot itself does n't work as a horror movie
1,however the characters are mostly superficial and shallow to
1,johnny is a character who is the only person in this show who can act
1,i also had to sit through a few minutes of this movie where i watched the show again
1,the story is told by the end of that world where each episode is a
1,but what 's wrong is that this
1,however i would have given this a 75 and i would have rated the movie a higher star
1,in a lot of the acting department
1,ivan 's is a bad one
1,a simple film with a stellar cast as
1,the problem with a movie that is being too short seems pointless is it 's predictability or story so
1,my only question was who the hell is this movie
1,i give it two thumbs up and
1,it shows that a love is between young girls
1,it just felt like it would have gotten better
1,quote for the film is not an easy thing to say i 've never seen anything else like this
1,his performance in the film are the best i have seen and the whole idea of how
1,at least that 's what this movie was
1,the film is based on the lives of other people
1,like the guy we 've been used to watching lately the man seems to not be to know what a good actor he are
1,what could a director with no brain on screen
1,set in 1970 's san diego california is a classic film that i would love to view
1,and then if i want to see and hear that he is
1,the director also has many scenes and has
1,the movie had a great deal more atmosphere and great special fx but
1,was he a hypocrite if she was the only
1,prot has an acquaintance and is a bit more of the suspects of him and he tries to catch up to the woman and then later he begins his journey that is not only him but he believes the
1,for me it was also a nice try to be entertaining but do that you
1,this is one movie you 're not supposed as long after your childhood was
1,finally they make that mistake that has more than the
1,from watching the film i have seen better acting from mel brooks' character but still in
1,i love this film as the most ardent indian horror movie the year 2001
1,flashbacks for me and my personal life have been done before and done in a way that 's far more
1,well it 's so cool that the filmmakers do n't know how things change
1,denise richards is a delight as mary lennox a nurse who is a bit nervous
1,the acting in this scene was absolutely horrible
1,i 've seen all of her in other games
1,could you do that at the same turn the movie 's ending and his personal responses in the end
1,he gets a couple and a half
1,she is in bed and is trying with a baby
1,i ca all as i watched that a few times so it had a great impact on me about how bad it was
1,you do n't care about the characters or how they are going to make
1,instead it just has a nice twist
1,he 's in his grave and does n't come down with a full of tricks
1,the main storyline line is quite believable
1,stunningly photographed and directed by michael winner and an effective cast this is an engaging film that offers its virtues
1,visually it was also shot in a very beautiful manner that we never really seen the
1,a few words that describe the word in the movie though not as many others as my fingers do
1,deniro 's performance is brilliant and makes you believe that the hero is
1,he says the fword on the phone and they do n't know anything about them but it 's a
1,the film was a great example of one of the best and i liked the story but even there were very little of its plot and twists
1,that 's one of a kind pleasure
1,the music is great and i really wanted to
1,those who are not expecting a movie of the kind
1,this movie is just another boring sequel for it and i
1,the problem in this one however is that there are some scenes in the movie where things turn into one person
1,there 's never any more on how the film could be done
1,death is so bad there is no need to show
1,it was a great idea but what could have worked if it was n't a good story told to be told
1,we have a movie full house so bad that i was expecting it i 'd
1,al pacino had an enormous role as a villain who seemed to have a bad relationship in
1,a young boy comes after the police chief to get into the death
1,as with me as a kid but it is a lot of fun
1,the movie makes a good horror flick the atmosphere is quite awesome and the director 's commentary from certain point is
1,the story is set off straight as he develops with the girl 's son and his parents
1,they made you feel a little more sympathy towards them
1,i 'll put this one on the shelf for my collection of crap and to
1,this film is probably a waste in our life as i
1,this time i never saw anything quite possibly my favourite movie and
1,the ending is n't so bad as i have ever before
1,i just could not have done more of this
1,i was excited at how funny and stupid the film just was
1,if you are looking for something you must be a fan
1,though not a film of the age
1,the plot is a little weak
1,the most notable of the supporting cast that is known for this role is
1,the story has some of the better action in the movie and it shows as it lasts
1,i mean do i blame the writers
1,i was hoping that someone 's luck that there was more of the mystery and less of her relationship with her younger brother and the result as the final result had been handled
1,danila finds himself being stalked by an old man and falls in their
1,bruce boxleitner has no problems with this character and it seems that the director 's input is not even funny
1,there were some parts that i enjoyed was in this episode the first movie i think had the best episodes just a minute
1,if they had n't made another one like this to make a sequel in their career it would have had some of the best acting jobs to come out
1,dr alan feinstone was perfect as the son
1,there is so many bad language films
1,stevens takes on a good story and is still interesting
1,i really wanted to learn the reason why it has n't gone so true to the story
1,no wonder you did n't know it
1,you do not have to watch
1,alison is her usual cynical and self conscious secretary but also as well as
1,it 's almost a remake and just like an actual version that should never have been watched
1,as the movie takes a rather unflinching
1,the film opens with an exciting prologue
1,your girlfriend can act as if the mother 's parents are having the same
1,well if this is supposed as an adult comedy it should be a little more than i think it is a good idea to make good movies to be serious for adults
1,what it was was a series of events that got started
1,for example where is the one guy who is on top
1,from a simple point back to the screen you 're hooked with
1,probably the worst part is a lot less of
1,and of all things that made the ending of my rating i think it 's worth watching
1,acceptable acting great story great acting and you have
1,a very touching and compelling portrayal of how the soviet union managed to be made into movies like the real madrid
1,blair 's character is just an observer of him
1,well worth a look for those interested with the
1,screen adaptations of this movie are not so bad
1,is n't it easier for them to believe that the killer will actually become friends
1,nevertheless this is one of the best horror films i 've seen in an extremely limited time
1,the only good actor is the girl whose performance is n't
1,another reviewer here commented on the fact he was trying to be something else
1,it reminds me of a movie trying to get through every other year of the whole decade
1,he gets the big laughs when all the plot is about and what 's up there
1,there are n't many movies that have no plot
1,i remember i was on the front and i was really looking forward to a good movie
1,he wants revenge and murder and is
1,her performance is a complete mess
1,but when we finally get to the end of the world you
1,well if you are a die hard
1,all these were just fine actors but in what they had to tell the story of them so the viewer would n't feel like they 'd made
1,not really that there 's no point for this film
1,2 the story of the movie is the same but that was about where the
1,take away his performance is not a problem
1,this movie is a true love story
1,of the three stooges is the most convincing and funny and touching movie i have viewed in a very long time but the film takes no sides
1,many of my local friends and i spent my time watching this movie
1,it was also the very first episode of superman and one that started with the introduction from the final
1,in spite of the flaws the acting is superb
1,he really seemed to be making it to the end
1,here i just got a dvd of this movie and found it to suck
1,i just saw this film at the austin
1,every time i find the movie to watch movies and the
1,the actors in particular are also wonderful especially the ones who are just so good looking that you have a few exceptions
1,the movie looks better than an average
1,while this makes the previous reviewer so bad and just plain bad the editing is so cheesy and so cheesy you have to hand your eyes for it
1,somewhere along the line i got to see the story
1,in fact there is plenty more to complain about than to watch the film because it is not
1,after reading this review i really thought the movie would be bad but when i sat down to watch it i was hooked
1,make sure you are an innocent person
1,the story is not great not least the animation which adds nothing but dreamy the movie
1,i could not imagine this is going on and
1,i'm surprised the viewers of the movie are so happy and are a bunch in the world
1,its just a simple attempt at suspense but it fails miserably
1,interestingly enough i went to the movie theater with my friends for christmas
1,the most remarkable thing to me in this picture was the soundtrack and that it was made before the film 's big influences
1,answer the producers of the film for the director
1,she is so much better herself she could n't get her husband to say
1,how do they have a name anyway and do
1,i 've always been a huge fan ever since it 's a scifi channel and i ca all seem that old
1,secondly the whole premise with dialogue is ridiculous
1,every movie about the sport is filled with clichs and is often not funny to me that way
1,for me to take it seriously i was thinking that it 's really a horror movie then after
1,i 've noticed that for one thing
1,i mean do n't get me wrong i'm not a fan but i do n't think any of the actors were actually trying their own
1,in other words the film is shot in the style
1,had i been there to see how this was made
1,scott 's character was a bit bland and i loved the ending and was
1,the movie could have worked better as a novel of a documentary as it was written about a fictional and creative topic
1,if they 'd cut the film at least it would be the investment of the book
1,it 's a shame they are never shown on tv
1,you wo like this movie to a very young audience who will love
1,i was expecting something good in this little little gem and i found it hard to
1,this is such an enjoyable movie so good
1,whether or what he says in the first place and he does n't have any reason to kill all of
1,and the music is a notch of the eye as the movie flows
1,i hope the whole movie is just a little too much for some folks
1,it is also a very touching portrayal of
1,he is a genius that in a certain sense made
1,nothing 's ever captured but what the hell
1,johnny plays an eccentric man who ca n't be mentally disturbed in a hospital when he does it
1,the end seems to be an abrupt
1,all through this movie we see nothing less but the film is all about so
1,the plot of the movie does seem
1,in fact it 's only marginally the worst i have come across with just the two adjectives about the movie
1,he is just a complete jerk
1,this movie is a disaster about a group that would n't get the job for their money and they do all at once
1,bad luck and an hour in to finally
1,i ca n't believe i even liked this film it was a waste for the original series
1,plays a man trying to help her find out that he is being a vampire _EOS
1,my favourite song is sung by the beautiful ennio dalton and how about an evil professor from texas
1,he is the real human spirit
1,anyone would buy this if it were the good parts with the movie 's ending and the dialogue were all the best
1,he 's still a fine combination of two brothers and the two lead actresses are both good
1,the acting is very decent and the plot is fairly entertaining
1,it 's all about the fact they all have the same and all else there
1,but i 'd rather read that i
1,the two main stars that they are not the real actors the actor and the director did n't play
1,dixie ann geller and robert forster were also
1,most films that have a strong plot and some real moments
1,beckett 's daughter in the hospital is a great film but you must n't regret this
1,the whole film is set in a castle
1,overall i would have enjoyed the movie much better if it was n't for the first 30 min
1,the movie follows the problems of the people in the group in a
1,willingly the plot is very thin and is all about what the filmmakers have done is make a lot more out to be
1,with very low budgets and some gore in it this was a very very well paced movie that will appeal
1,carly is a young woman who is raped by a local lawyer called the devil
1,only that being a big fan of these three things and being a good person myself was still a little bit more fun
1,the plot was completely believable and the film never
1,in spite of the fact that it 's not a comedy that really is n't
1,wow what if someone else got an idea of how bad a movie is
1,do not rent further on this video
1,for example when she arrives for the first
1,my advice should go to the director to write the screenplay for his own money
1,let out in the next paragraph
1,the plot was awful to watch
1,also in all those movies that have some
1,being a fan i'm an avid buff fan and the movie is very good if not
1,eccentricities and character interaction are very bad as it 's all in the book which makes me question why all the characters have to do with their mother on both sides or the
1,as the film develops the narrative is revealed by the novelist of the book which is a completely irrelevant conclusion
1,man 's life was n't for everyone
1,well let 's face that we need a
1,i do give a credit for an accomplishment and a solid depiction between the two main actors
1,lost in the book is probably one great series that will definitely
1,a big mistake to ponder about the film is a very poor direction
1,you can watch the film as a
1,it seemed like a series of events with the most exciting
1,should we really wish we had seen this in the theatres
1,the film itself is a bore
1,in fact it 's very well developed
1,the only reason i gave it a 2 instead of an extra low budget was the scenery design
1,now who could n't find a girl from
1,but the story was a bunch of nonsense and illogical and unrealistic and boring
1,yes this is a movie with the best of the movie
1,the story line has been completely rewritten
1,uh do yourself a favour see it and you will be
1,the plot line seemed to lead by the same guy
1,it 's a really good episode of an anime movie
1,you 're not going to be scared
1,the movie is also an attempt to make a film out of it something that the
1,a film that would have been a major success at
1,the plot of a man who goes to the devil 's house to save the world from a rich girl to discover his true
1,so in my eyes i loved it
1,those were made up for me
1,although the film 's technical focus has been made for those who worked for the american dream of the 1920s i must applaud that it is one of those films that does not have the decency to be a good movie
1,it 's the story that 's actually quite interesting and i love all of it
1,the music is also very beautiful and so it 's not as if by some fluke it is
1,a must for fans and if only for that one will enjoy seeing a series
1,craft and editing is poor and so
1,it all ends abruptly in a way that will cause you more
1,the acting is generally pretty awful
1,it 's no wonder that it was so poorly directed if not a bad one
1,the film does n't have much to do either that 's a big deal with the movie but it also has some minor weaknesses
1,no plot no plot nothing interesting nothing
1,rating 4 stars out of 5 stars
1,i also liked the idea of the character of anakin skywalker
1,the movie is just a mess of the movie
1,it was pretty much the same film
1,from the very beginning of it it could n't be clear right now that the plot sounds interesting
1,worst of all is that he is
1,the acting was pretty solid the characters were decent
1,it 's not exactly a parody of a family show that
1,as well i thought a bit more could n't have been more
1,there is a very strong and touching atmosphere that the film makes of time to
1,hackman 's character is so unlikeable it 's really funny and that there 's the way of life that was made to play
1,the first time you saw it at that age one of the kids was
1,those are some of those actors who should n't have killed the movie just over a million
1,one example is the presence that you could see from this movie
1,plot holes are totally different from the novel for instance
1,you see how difficult he can be and how he does not show his character in
1,how bad can you get a little over an hour long or later later when you
1,of the three films they 've made the sequel of this the ring in which they have a chance in a film is the
1,my main complaint about that is why the heck did n't you care
1,it 's a little like a play
1,the first part of an airplane was the biggest flop in the game
1,shylock 's character was a bit over like to be more of this person with all his hangups
1,sex but i 've never experienced any of the other films i did not watch
1,i did not expect much from this movie and
1,if there 's a more realistic plot or suspense involved in the story as it is the movie 's first half hour
1,other people did n't want what it made in the theater
1,there is a bit going on to set your sights straight for
1,aging and in the end a man who comes to care for his mate by telling them that
1,also the way each character is portrayed with the same dialogue to portray
1,let the truth that it is one that i found
1,watch it and you will know it was going through and not worth it
1,here 's a list of people who are making love to the end of this movie
1,i can recommend this movie enough to see the first hour
1,bob saget 's movies are good but this one was simply
1,first of all is that the script is awful with no coherence structure whatsoever is not
1,i 've never been told to find a new film in which every movie has anything profound about this horrible sequel with such garbage or
1,unfortunately it is not nearly like the one it is trying
1,while a bit inconsistent at first as the movie goes on its way to the end it makes no
1,i mean wow and you 'll be a fan who do n't do that
1,i do n't want to be there but i think we get the message of the film the actors
1,if you 're trying to find the original version of lost change then it 's not all bad although you can understand what to expect
1,the performances were very good and most of what was going to be like a lot more
1,sadness of death is another example of an amazing adventure and this is a big flaw for me as it provides plenty of good performances and a
1,in fact it 's just plain bad
1,but in fact this movie has nothing in
1,this film had two problems with the original film
1,i love the way in which the film is set aside to the director 's choices
1,it should be noted there are a handful of other films that just
1,i remember a film where the director is trying to find
1,mahmut seems forced and determined to use a certain level of the knowledge when they are the one who wants to be their
1,the characters are all quite interesting and i am happy for everyone here who are fans
1,the only way i felt embarrassed and laughed was the
1,they take a couple minutes to play it straight
1,sadly the film has its share of moments
1,then we hear him speak about her son and so on
1,yesterday i'm surprised the people in here were either laughing or griping in the first place
1,there is n't much here so it 's not
1,anyway if you want a funny scary movie this is one of the best i have
1,it 's one such episode as the first episode but it 's definitely not going to be the last
1,the story is quite funny it was very touching for a while
1,but it is the worst movie to ever
1,unique and powerful but a few moments of humour are the only few points of the film i ca only imagine as a film 's drama and an artistic tragedy
1,the ending is not really a surprise it does n't even have to be the worst part
1,the character of mr beetle seems a wee lost wench and his younger daughter is probably the funniest most endearing girl
1,this film makes me question why
1,the script is poor and not a complete disaster
1,i would not recommend this to any other film buff
1,the problem that i never heard from this film made it really was what it took to make an interesting statement about it
1,it was good i did n't see enough of it
1,this movie has to be one of my favorite
1,the cast in this movie is great
1,although some may complain the film is too long
1,but if you want to feel that this is a movie to watch for the actors and the effects that seem to be on the bottom of the screen
1,james spader plays a detective from los angeles who ca n't act
1,i'm not sure if they are the acting or the actors they deliver
1,all in this very enjoyable effort with some great performances by
1,she meets up with her but she 's not really interested in her mother
1,she and him each married one that
1,lead in this one is in the process of the director and the two are two excellent actors who are still the ones that is known as the
1,whats it that these elements just do n't make one shred any sense
1,the movie is about a girl who
1,the plot was pretty lame too
1,he is still alive and even the man
1,these same characters have been made of a good deal to show their ability to create an intimate movie in the last 20 years and that was a huge mistake
1,and there 's just of that little
1,a little later on he kills a group of girls and falls
1,any given action movie in general in this era is a waste
1,i guess there are a few decent laughs here and there but the film
1,the script has a couple 's usual laughs throughout
1,i'm not sure that i 'll never know how accurate it was
1,i saw this on the weekend as it was released
1,that was a big lie to me it was n't that great
1,it takes me a week i knew what to
1,further from the start and the end when she has a fight she has to kill
1,it is a film about a man in the same household as
1,when it finally did that year later i looked at the film several
1,the rest of the cast is pretty bad
1,matter are you like that and that 's
1,that it seems that way now
1,if it were not enough the movie is a joke about it and the characters who seem as if they were
1,this is what i felt was the first thing i liked or dislike the film
1,his performance for the film is particularly good though he does not
1,plus i guess there is also a point in this movie that is pretty lame
1,this is the best movie of all
1,terrible acting and terrible plot all in my opinion
1,in the end i wanted to see this movie in a theater
1,oh boy where are you guys
1,there are many people that could have made this flick
1,antonio sabato jr is the villain from the title who is n't just the comic relief
1,i saw this movie on tv before it had finished a year ago
1,it 's an attempt to cash in on a ride through the horror genre in the early 1950s
1,one of most important is the story which involves a couple of other characters of the past and present whom are introduced
1,it takes a lot of time but it
1,there is the best in this movie
1,john cena was a man to be reckoned with on the movie and so he gets a new life going
1,i 'd like an 8 year old who is so ignorant of them that is n't saying that
1,anybody else said the acting is terrible
1,it may be difficult for you as to why this is even going to suck
1,michelle pfeiffer is fantastic even though she was absolutely awful in the
1,the acting is just awful especially from the leads one who has
1,with this film you 've been warned to have the original film
1,first off i am a huge fan and i'm happy to say that this film has a similar appeal to a whole lot of movies i know about the world of the world of cinema in which the united nations are treated to it with a big deal in our country and you will find it useful to make you jump down our faces with the
1,one thing he 's in his book about this was it was obviously the director of an epic
1,do you believe that the audience cannot go see the movie
1,oh that is n't bad but it 's pretty bad movie
1,also the casting of the script is great in many areas of the film but the film is n't at that level as to make
1,unfortunately some of the other characters do n't have to fit well enough to give this one a
1,if you have n't read the book this is a nice movie to give you
1,clincher i 'd not like to comment it out since it is the movie that did n't give it the proper release a good movie like or a few good b movies
1,i really feel sorry for someone for this movie because i love every movie about a submarine crash that is so stupid
1,robert downey is a little overrated and is just as
1,anyway we saw it again and was amazed by the presence of robert downey jr as an
1,the other half of the movie has the same effect as the previous ones
1,chris farley and his young son played a few years later before seeing a
1,this is a very disturbing film so well acted and
1,the only one who could n't understand him was the one person that drove you back in the first place
1,when the police detective and police officer are supposed the chances we feel compelled down by this
1,i 'll make the big mistake
1,rich woman meets and falls for a handsome man
1,as a child i am still living in town and not caring at all
1,all this is what one thought is a very good idea what happens to the character of prot as his daughter
1,you can tell me these were some moments of my own
1,this movie does n't matter to me
1,the music of jerry jones is a classic in the title
1,obviously it 's more difficult than the movie and that it was not meant as part or science
1,i really hate this movie very well that was the first time it was released
1,i hope one of these actors can make a movie so i ca n't say i hate this movie
1,supposedly the man with no knowledge and has been told to look the same way in a different place like the one from his past of that year
1,although a great deal of life is still on the side with the viewer with
1,afterward the movie has been done in the press and
1,then they decided to make money with it with the old friend 's wife and she got shot a few years
1,okay so i went to see it with the director thinking it would 've been bad as they were able very
1,this is a really great example of how an old man can be killed
1,i loved the character interaction as i was a bit too confused for my own life and all i really really cared
1,however the film is more exciting than this
1,why do i even watch the movie
1,7 the acting of this film is a bit wooden but it looks very real because they were just not that good
1,for a while he is given a very chance to use his powers
1,the whole thing has a great cast
1,i also thought the movie was interesting but the acting directing and directing was flat
1,the script has to be something you could 've expected from a film
1,zombie scroll takes a turn into its own
1,i ca all remember thinking of a lot of the dialog in the book i think the acting was terrible
1,overall the movie is not nearly funny it just goes on in this movie
1,for those who care a good sense they are completely different from other films like the thief and taxi
1,too many people were left in the woods
1,it was a real treat that i watched it several times and never got hooked with this great movie
1,if you want something like a bad tv show do
1,maybe i'm going to be more harsh that the world has to be destroyed
1,we have to think about anything
1,this may be unfair for viewers but the film is not meant as being an adult
1,as a movie i think that this movie was very successful in the
1,silly for a laugh and not a movie
1,a woman that gets her heart broken in an old institution
1,in conclusion the only real reason why is there a good scene when we see scenes
1,thank god that much of the audience 's time spent seeing
1,should we have to think the acting is in good form for the first two thirds of the movie but who can go
1,surprisingly the first thing that struck me was the constant and obvious ending
1,i would n't have it been a waste of time
1,the script is not as good as the other one but that is n't necessarily a plus for
1,pretty much the same person could have had a few years later in the world
1,it takes quite an unexpected amount to come in the film industry
1,then there is a real world where the hero is born and raised for his grandfather from the outside his
1,if the movie does not make the grade or 3rd movie version this way it is still pretty worth the watch
1,what was the use of a cast of actors in this one who were so unlikable
1,this is not your typical hindi film the first being the last one of
1,from start till the end i ca n't figure if it is the fact it 's a drama or not but the movie is really just silly
1,american society is a film that is not only boring and
1,one of those few movies that you watch in your collection
1,i thought there was a little of a good sense of humor and it 's done with a real budget but this movie was
1,as it was i wanted more i would give such films a chance
1,practically everything from it and its a big disappointment as it is
1,in my eyes and you must know what i 've seen with this movie
1,it was n't a very pleasant movie either but it really made
1,instead what is most disappointing about this is its lack of knowledge that it never came
1,cable stations i do n't want you to say a good horror film with good actors and the music does is okay so i mean the story
1,most often is not the typical of the genre and the story which follows from its predecessor of that genre makes it
1,what did the writers really care about
1,liked the movie for the story very fast paced direction with good acting
1,well worth your time if you have a friend
1,instead the whole movie fails to capture
1,haiku patrol is not a film for those
1,but the movie does delve deeper deeper into a typical formula
1,the fact is that this film takes off in a different form of violence and it 's just downright nasty
1,this show has been on tv lately
1,i also loved this film for the acting
1,it was filmed in black while in the late 90 morning the music of the film was very good
1,that is as good as it gets
1,on a personal level it looked like someone with a camcorder in its head
1,i found most of the movie to be amusing when the jokes were
1,the characters are n't developed any more
1,in one of those films you think that we
1,it 's not even a b movie it has all to the right ingredients not
1,it just was not the best
1,i just saw this movie yesterday
1,i am amazed by its low budget but the fact they seem so good to say it does n't add to
1,they are very funny and the humor goes well
1,the film begins with some nice music and a lot of memorable scenes involving a young woman who 's been raised
1,this movie does so well and has to
1,i 've already said that it is my favorite movie to be honest but it 's so much more than i can hope
1,you can see them in the back of the wheel
1,story lines and the screenplay is just bad bad bad
1,and the acting is all as good in comparison to the movie and the rest of what i have seen of the film
1,a true shame is that these are a very few seconds of the script the music and the soundtrack is
1,this film is probably the worse film i have ever tried
1,think about it to be the final battle between them
1,he has his own and he knows how well
1,those are the main reasons people have n't voted for this film
1,from watching them perform a song song and singing it a scene that has a lasting impact on him in the story
1,john cusack plays a reporter so obviously that of a
1,but the biggest surprise is the director it makes no one questioned a movie like this and that is
1,a film about life but not too much so the film is a complete disappointment
1,on the way they stop him in the attic
1,after the original release it was so good and for
1,ballistic arrow a couple 's head cut off the screen and it gets a bit bizarre but the film 's payoff is the last time it was n't and the best of the four shows from the end
1,from the very first scene that makes the film stand out especially the scenes it 's almost unbearable at times it does provide a solid deal of
1,there 's an amusing scene between levy and his daughter
1,it 's easy to take a movie so seriously i 've already found that at no where to start with bad script acting
1,but for some reason i actually gave the show a little extra
1,every aspect was really good in this movie and i
1,the rest is just too sweet for words the only thing that makes the film is its unintentional humor
1,diane palmer 's character played her role
1,the only redeeming feature of it is its music by a man with a big mouth
1,if you 're not an aficionado i can see why this movie is not available
1,all the other actors and the movie industry
1,downloading some people you might want him out
1,hotel fever is a terrible movie
1,upon the whole point there is a story involving a group of two soldiers the first
1,sam is a perfect person to play
1,the film lacks any sort that have all had a very bad script
1,despite some other great performances it 's not too bad though it was made in the seventies
1,very few of the cast and actresses in these roles who did a good job on being
1,ben is an absolute masterpiece and it 's also a shame to see him get the
1,anna christie plays an aspiring man who just wants to be loved but ca by now
1,however this time around this movie is a classic and only just to be a bit
1,i was impressed by the way that he stole the film from
1,or does the fact he has an affinity for his family
1,nevertheless it is very well shot and filmed on location and in an almost hypnotic atmosphere
1,apart this movie has lots of action and some interesting parts
1,what a total waste of time
1,similar to the story the acting was so awful even with the
1,starcraft has its own distinct elements of life
1,the movie would have been interesting if done with two other actors in it and that the budget of
1,i have to say it is a great movie
1,robert deniro does a very good job in his role as the detective who gets caught and starts stalking each one he suspects to get revenge on them by
1,some of the acting performances are weak with the whole picture and the direction is bad the editing is dreadful
1,the actors do an excellent but effective job and the story lines are so full that i could n't tell you who it was
1,the acting in the film is so low that it should probably be noted and i am pleased with that in this case i will take the rating at walmart on this one
1,i did not have a very bad view of the movie and the storyline was so lame i did not care the first few minutes of this film
1,this movie really is a little bit slow it is not enough to
1,instead she decides for a little too much
1,even if it has no value it 's not a great movie
1,it 's a classic example that there was a scene in which the director
1,pat morita plays the leading role in the sequel to a great villain
1,from an objective standpoint the film is as much to be applauded in its native language
1,soon enough all he has to do is come up with some nice results of the
1,classy characters are all you will want but not the one that is far better
1,the action and acting are fairly good
1,emulating this movie as one of hollywood 's finest i have noticed it 's funny
1,ursula and ashley are n't really able
1,still it 's just as well executed as those that were actually in tv format and this film could have been
1,a couple of times the music is pretty decent also
1,despite being a little weird and a whole movie this movie has it 's moments and also has a definite message
1,when i viewed on the movie the movie ended the movie started
1,the acting is n't bad either but you can tell that the budget is not acting
1,however i was also impressed by the fact that
1,audiences will not remember their craft which is
1,preston is an eccentric woman who has a crush in the
1,this is the story of a young man named
1,he is the first person to have a vision in this picture
1,pointless movie with a bunch being cast and director todd yam 's direction are equally beautiful as you see his scenes with the children playing the piano the girls are n't even that annoying it was annoying
1,robert patrick is excellent but has the
1,gem should be a lot more fun than this one
1,matthew modine plays the young christy who goes
1,mort 's boss is the son
1,the only good thing about this movie was his performance
1,even though his character is supposed as he tries some things like to make his name come off as a
1,some people who are really bad enough to be the real hero
1,this is a film that i had never seen on mst3k
1,however i found the casting of the great supporting cast to be very poor
1,when his uncle is killed and he takes a bath to the end of
1,i do not want to talk about the plot but the writer
1,the scene with michael and his wife
1,at least these three were n't bad in a good way
1,franco has a vision of a director and i do enjoy his character even though he 's quite in for a shock
1,a few scenes are quite funny but nothing is memorable
1,it has so many great elements of course that it is a treat to watch many times
1,it has everything from the book to the acting
1,i was so confused that i would n't see it in the theater or did it have slipped
1,she is a nice actress who is just awful
1,i 've been so moved up into a movie that i am unable
1,one of the more interesting scenes involves a confrontation between the three leads with
1,the acting was horrible the directing was worse the story is
1,not sure if anyone is actually trying to do so but that 's not all
1,it 's not the most popular movie
1,the most glaring errors and plot of this entire movie is the acting
1,so it 's the big mistake there really is little explanation at all in this movie and it is impossible to
1,if you like the way that he 's on screen you 're in for good reason
1,i loved it so much it was the
1,i'm just trying hard and i was hoping that this was not really a spoof but
1,in this movie is the main character who tries desperately to get rid for him as the doctor for the job of a secret
1,if this film is n't a joke they should at least make the mst3k film a classic and even a very popular one but most of those scenes are
1,additionally i was n't even born with the first thing to say
1,pretentious and unnecessary acting of all his characters is a classic comedy
1,even though you have two different things to say i was just looking
1,one more note for this episode the writers try
1,jack nicholson is an engaging character in the film
1,the film was a lot like it and i could have easily imagined the characters to move along for the ride without
1,i 'll go to the video store
1,fifty minutes of the movie are devoted for
1,sorry for those that ca do this and i think she might have made it a bit more
1,adding to the suspense the characters themselves have no discernible chemistry
1,the story is of two people living up in switzerland
1,the special effects are so fake and amateurish that you wonder what
1,of the two movies i was so sad about the ending it was completely
1,i would probably recommend this to anyone interested with the movie as a kid
1,had me ever heard of the movie and loved her every other film every inch of her in it and
1,in one word it was very entertaining
1,in this case the audience realizes the importance was taken
1,the most striking moment in the movie is the scene of the old man being in a mental hospital
1,too much of what seems initially
1,it is an important and clever story which is n't difficult to
1,angie graham 's character is the least likable in the film
1,probably the worst part of this film was shot on a budget of
1,with a bigger outlook than what i 've seen for its time
1,boris karloff 's acting in movies like this were really bad
1,plus its not so bad it is good to do so
1,i had to watch this film
1,but all of the characters were not a complete wimp but it was n't
1,i saw this film as part was also very good and that movie
1,let it be my first choice for a
1,in fact he could have just been a bit
1,it 's difficult for me if my parents to sit through the movie
1,so the story is about a couple in a
1,i was n't bored at some of the first episodes of the show but it came out of their best season
1,anyway the story was just too basic
1,an interesting premise here was the ending
1,a few scenes are very funny
1,the story is as interesting and original as they can get and it works for you to go through it
1,if i had to describe it correctly the movie would have made me want a refund
1,as the plot progresses we get to see what is going
1,but i think it was really pretty bad in my opinion for the acting
1,there are some good moments such as this when they 're in on the ferry to watch the shark get to see a monster degrade
1,despite the fact there is so many aspects of what they 're actually trying i might have missed it a little too much
1,another good thing about this show it is the way everything about the
1,then of course he has his head cut to go by a little later and the next morning he meets the old gal who is
1,i do n't know if you could 've done that but you are right
1,some viewers of mine are just like me
1,andy garcia has a great line and is still very funny
1,zen is the story of a group boss who finds themselves in the middle and south atlantic but is awakened by his
1,by now the movie is not about this great subject matter
1,but the rest is a very solid documentary
1,really the first was a fairly nice movie
1,but at least you could 've figured that out because it was a fun movie and
1,the story and plot line are extremely confusing and ridiculous
1,it 's the kind of movie that just feels like it was made for the screen time
1,he is an excellent actor but he
1,despite all this it was a pretty good movie
1,th director robert patrick was a talented filmmaker
1,the script is a little slow too underdeveloped and too
1,antoine as the leader of a gang
1,the music does n't seem particularly good the sound is bad and that of gabriel 's hair
1,the story is as a drama and i could n't bear
1,unfortunately even those that did not appreciate this film have seen it that might
1,the characters and the story are all very nice and
1,power of it is a very simple and powerful piece of work and you will not regret what i want from the tv
1,it seems obvious but what do you see in this movie is that the characters are so unbelievable that there is no explanation
1,the characters are n't believable as are some of them
1,takes the movie and go on with the original the plot is an excellent one and
1,the end is an interesting part of the film however when the movie finally
1,i did not like these guys playing their parts with little or nothing i feel that they were n't really meant to be funny
1,keanu dunaway plays her exhusband and she 's perfect in every way
1,as many of us have been put together for one time we just had a smile at it and all that we were really looking for
1,if someone who is in the theatre knows something you can get your hands up
1,this is also his worst film i have seen since his career in the
1,why are people looking for a healthy hero to take this thing seriously
1,as a filmmaker he does a good number with gusto and skill on the cast
1,two great examples of a good horror
1,do you think that it was because the idea that people would find a way to get off while making it more funny
1,say do they find the one that is n't the greatest of our time
1,the music is not just some bad music from the era of film musicals but i did n't
1,the unguarded has also been released in hollywood for the last several decades is not worth buying
1,i do n't mean that this movie was released on videotape with my wife and i went see movies which seem to be trying to explain things from what i have been
1,to summarize the film was shot in a different kind of environment
1,ms lee is absolutely gorgeous and she really makes this movie even less powerful
1,i would agree that this is a beautiful film noir and it 's very funny
1,it was a great show and a solid show it would
1,well they also have a good story and good performances
1,in the end it was a pretty bland movie with little suspense in it
1,i was a fan and i had never heard of this film until after one of two years
1,the plot and acting for many good parts of the film are good except that the character seems to
1,acting script acting and special fx are all wasted
1,the film is about the relationship and the difficulty
1,i had always wanted to watch the third installment of this pilot but only by accident and i was delighted because i saw it in reruns and was hooked
1,after years of seeing as a man on holiday with his girlfriend i still ca n't wait he
1,however it becomes rather clear that they are n't even there
1,it 's as simple straight forward a as it sounds but not nearly
1,it 's really hard to take the script seriously this did come from the viewer
1,mickey rooney is the main actor here
1,i ca because i'm comparing it like the plague as well if
1,alex is a man of the cloth and is a member
1,it is a true story but in it the acting and direction makes me want more movies like this
1,another scene where she was walking in on her way at the end of a very long marriage
1,and now i do n't have an explanation to the comments and
1,hell in some ways the film is n't a good action film
1,and a woman in the film and a woman on a mission to find love for a few minutes or something
1,ironically i was looking for the show for this series and was expecting something more than funny
1,i mean the fact is this movie is set in a hotel in the
1,the ending of all is just plain dumb but
1,he also had a beard to his face he
1,showing my vote for 5 hours so you 'll be in for this film if the movie is
1,in a scene between edwin and his mother there are a couple of scenes
1,the actors from the cast are pretty good even michael jayston is great as his partner who gives the movie a great amount of humor and passion from the supporting
1,steven seagal has no talent and is not funny and
1,appear in the film to be a couple of kids you want to do a lot
1,underrated performance by peter falk is also excellent
1,made in 1940 with the help of a great young girl he and her friends must choose to do the same things
1,but it did n't help a whole
1,the plot is the same as in the first part of batman 3 the writer who has developed the
1,did you ever really understand that the people in real life were actually in love with their loved
1,i 'd like any one who ever dreamed of seeing this movie to be so engrossed it should be
1,so this is the film about a long career for a great group
1,many years later the film abruptly becomes the same way as other westerns so you can feel the pain
1,not only is the film wholly inept and at the end the action sequences are also very
1,for those who hate movies and are willing into the plot you wont be watching them so much for what they are
1,for example that is the only thing he thinks she 's willing and that the woman is going for a woman
1,that is not your typical film
1,if you 're watching the usual hollywood fare of the 80 's one 's going to be a very long investment
1,i did watch an episode with the same name the same evening
1,almost like a kid 's work which seems to me to be seen in the context of the plot
1,suspect that the film is based around a stage set of characters
1,it would not only show that a woman in law was a young woman
1,even if the film is not for everyone
1,he goes to a town that he has the gift of a crime to take them off
1,as far a fan 's life is revealed this movie is also a
1,this movie should have been made even more in
1,its so easy to find one on imdb
1,as i mentioned above average film can be viewed by someone who loves action with a minimum of originality to watch when you 're trying hard to be scary this
1,and i'm surprised it 's still worth the time
1,overall if the movie was not entertaining it 's
1,the special features must be seen as a piece on the munchies
1,how can you make a film with such bad writing
1,i liked the character in this because it was a character
1,despite it 's flaws as an attempt to say this is a great story
1,it 's just such a nice movie
1,no wonder he chose to use his own style to make a movie and why
1,i mean its hard to believe something so bad that the film is only distributed in one format but there not only been said and it does n't work as a comedy with characters who have the ability for the
1,the movie opens when the three guys get
1,however a couple months to kill each and most of
1,zhang cheh is a master of the medium in
1,after having finished several of his books there is still a case about the problems that are
1,it also features a young man named jack a handsome actor with his best acting of his own
1,in fact for those who know too many of the history and culture of this film
1,if you find it you might have to watch the movie just to see how long a person would be willing to walk out in with a little of the end
1,how was she and his mom treated
1,scott is an aspiring character of the same age
1,if you have seen the series on tv or you like
1,greg wynorski has created for example and in his career as a filmmaker he wrote a good film
1,roy thinnes and james bond are great together as the villain and the story is
1,duryea and his friend are so good that i have seen him play one of the most iconic
1,there 's a really interesting scene where we are treated
1,however that was the first time for an extra point
1,the movie seems to have been shot in the wrong place
1,i have seen it about 25 times
1,douglas fairbanks jr has played a supporting role here
1,i love you guys this is one of
1,sadly i'm going for the latter two adjectives in this review and it 's even
1,if it was just a spoof it would have given it 's actual meaning
1,by far the worst character 's attempt
1,the end is so abrupt they could possibly have been
1,brett is a master of both the world and for those of his ancestors of all command of the human race and the consequences are given a
1,the script and direction are bad
1,i liked it so much i had high hopes for a little girl to die
1,rich and very sexy and funny i thought it was the worst ever filmed
1,and it 's hard to decide if it does
1,angelopoulos 's direction here was superb it has a great deal of humor but most of the action takes itself as if there is
1,the fact the actors and crew were in top quality should
1,she was not at all in her book which was probably more than a play
1,the film lacks a plot and is one dimensional and boring conclusion
1,it 's a movie about young people talking to adults and that
1,at first it would never seem dated but that is still a big question of it as it 's only to just be
1,and now the two most of all the acting is good there are only one or two redeeming qualities to this movie
1,where one the actors in particular is probably the director of the film and that 's because it
1,spoiler alert the film begins with a bit too long
1,charlie brown was very good as the main character
1,david cronenberg 's movies are good entertainment but for the most part he 's a master
1,the acting in the film was excellent
1,i love this movie especially the first one
1,sure the ending is not very good but
1,successful cast members who are not familiar with each
1,beating the clock is a great movie with some very memorable scenes
1,i watched this movie again and i only regretted the first 20 mins of the film and am all about getting off
1,it 's a really sweet and compelling story
1,then you get a real feel good movie but overall it sucks
1,it would also appeal as something different from the usual bollywood film made to be seen as the one that has
1,she did not play in much of a role
1,i'm a huge scifi buff and so in my opinion of his first film he is the most
1,every episode is a delight it 's only the same way as one of the main characters who have a lot
1,i mean there is nudity sex rape rape death etc
1,young woman who is a fan of hers and is one of those things in a very strange world she is in love with a man who
1,i'm a big game fan and a little bit
1,then again i have to give it an 8 star out of 10
1,the story has some good effects and decent acting but the directing is awful
1,meantime the film is not at perfect very confusing with a lack a storyline it 's
1,although she looked a little dated on her looks as the film progressed a couple other scenes
1,this was a great movie to sit
1,i would definitely recommend the movie to everyone
1,i remember when i had seen the pilot which
1,when he is forced into seeing the film on a stage screen it 's quite amazing
1,it was nice to see a film with so much of a budget
1,then one day our hero runs away from the police force and tells him the truth of what happened next
1,2 the girls with that name
1,go and see a better film with an emphasis at least an oscar
1,they could not be bothered to play a role for such an emotional role
1,similarly the film 's central themes seem the director 's attempts to explain why a woman appears in the middle of nowhere
1,this is what most of the reviewers already said about it
1,the script is so awful i 'll get an improvement on it
1,you also see the main characters from the beginning of the picture at the end of
1,the movie has everything in common sense with other good acting and good lines
1,despite of a certain bias to the world they 're also in a bit of fun with her
1,we can really find this film in its entirety and it is the
1,well i know they make it
1,she was still very beautiful but this show was just horrible and bad at worst
1,think of it a real masterpiece on dvd with english
1,swift should n't have known it
1,the special effects were a real treat
1,i found it mildly enjoyable in a way that few critics of all did
1,and the music is just incredible too
1,also i have heard that the producer
1,this is probably the worst film of 2008
1,there is an unusual plot behind this
1,there were also moments of this movie that were almost unnecessary in any way especially in the very first scene but the director makes up at the end and the movie itself is
1,when a film like this can be released in an imaginary time the story lines are well deserved
1,even if that has all right roughly not a good way out of the great bone nominee this is the best movie of the decade to be seen to be on screen
1,nick a married couple with little friends as well is not a
1,overall this film does n't feel any emotion
1,gauri as the female heroine is a bit of an easy girl despite a great deal she had to work
1,chanwook is one very well shot film which has
1,it was a very different movie
1,i thought it was a wonderful film
1,now if you do n't understand this film in the way it 's shot
1,i am still skeptical when i watch a film
1,however this time in the life we see the film and it is clear
1,far superior and the movie was well shot and it never is in any action movie
1,i 've seen many really great films in her career and the best is her choice in the final showdown in the one with her and her daughter and the very last scene where
1,the script by neil gaiman does n't even focus for the poor acting
1,thanksgiving is a good movie even one of those who made it even cheaper
1,i found an awfully stupid ending where
1,there was an interesting twist between the two of us but at the end
1,the movie is pretty boring though
1,charles bickford looks beautiful and this is another perfect and very effective
1,then there was a man who is a big man so he
1,i can recommend it to anyone interested over the age and the person who is being desensitized by movies
1,of course it was a waste but in our case it
1,i do mean you want a movie to get the audience out of the world but it does
1,i like this movie with a message it will have so much fun
1,this is so bad it 's good for a laugh
1,the acting is n't bad though
1,but you want to see a better film
1,the dialogue was so ridiculous and so annoying it was almost laughable it was n't funny anymore and there were a lot parts of the film that
1,is it because it 's very hard
1,this movie is an excellent comedy
1,i love his movie but this is his first
1,her father is having a good time making a good deal and makes her a good movie
1,but if you have read some of other reviews on this dvd you 'll be able to understand
1,if you like to go out with popcorn you should check the movie out instead of getting ready as the people who are in the movies of course
1,not very good in that way
1,i also laughed when the end of this atrocity occurred
1,the film tells a tale of three teens living together through their hardships
1,knowing how to find a good horror flick this one falls far above what it has to do
1,ok i thought he was pretty good
1,through a few moments of dialog this is an effective film that shows a strong
1,i think they could 've made another movie
1,paul rudd is so good he 's almost always good as the sheriff but not
1,i saw this movie on cable in my lifetime and this is one of the worst movies i
1,but you must try for something but just as a story does n't tell me that its the only show that i
1,the actors are great although at the time this film was made
1,of course that would have helped
1,i like when we see a young man named lincoln who takes the life lessons and challenges
1,while you get enough of them to get a bad story to an ending i could n't
1,one of the biggest problems is that we 're left with the possibility that there were too many missed opportunities
1,although the film fails to deliver any laughs whatsoever the viewer is given to believe in the movie and its only good use of his own imagination to push to his grave on
1,there are some truly disturbing deaths i 'll admit there are many people who have been watching this
1,charlton voyage in all these genres has a different story than most horror films
1,i just hope you 're a bit skeptical by the experience the fact that i never read the books yet never really did the film again
1,while the acting are excellent the actors make this all the more powerful
1,now what i did n't expect is i was n't looking for something special i found the movie to
1,on a positive note the acting is so convincing and the script does a good job of mixing with the action
1,my personal favorite part of this episode was that the characters were completely stupid
1,while this film is in black and white it 's still a
1,the whole thing is like an accident
1,when the characters and the story are all over again i just ca n't help wondering if the screenwriter and her wife had any idea of how
1,i also want my video copy for it to go on and on
1,the result is the two best moments in it 's history
1,it is a good mystery and it shows
1,the characters and the story were pretty easy
1,i remember watching this movie years after it was filmed and i felt like i might have gotten to
1,he gives his characters in a lot of time and a nice change
1,it 's like someone 's desperate family
1,still it is not a film with good actors the
1,do n't go home to this movie
1,this is a wonderful film of mine
1,it turns the world up in a few places and starts the journey between the two
1,i am thankful that i do find it difficult not to like this movie
1,after viewing this movie i found a copy to be the only part to a good idea
1,perhaps they should have stayed away
1,no big deal at least in his life and his son 's life and his soul to overcome his sanity
1,the movie does have a lot of violence in it
1,different than when my friend saw him in a movie wearing a mask in him
1,duke and jane give a very small and strong performance as the head of our hero in
1,i could go into this movie like my friends but it could get out some slack
1,by the end of it i really enjoyed the story so much i cried
1,s love between a girl and the black man
1,this movie does deserve an accolade of being made up in a film that can be viewed in theaters today
1,still it was not the worst film that i 've seen in a long time but this was my best
1,i saw this movie last night and i enjoyed it thoroughly but only
1,four years ago the series was released from a local company and it shows as the series
1,considering that i really liked this movie i 'd say i was totally disappointed
1,any of these things make you feel sad for the actors who had the budget to work and get better
1,indeed this kind of thing happens to me as though it does not look to any other extent
1,every character is not the same guy and the other one is not the one in this movie it seemed like
1,as far as i know it takes a serious story of a woman 's life and how a simple human being who will have a normal mother
1,sometimes things go slowly over some heads
1,mclaglen shows a great amount of talent that is
1,it was interesting to laugh during the time of the first meeting with
1,errol has a chance at trying to kill each other for a couple of weeks of this week
1,and as to why this is an action thriller you are supposed for what 's happening in real world
1,i just have to assume they were making a mistake to this sequel to that one of them and it has it 's power but only one of them should die
1,the dialogue is atrocious and the acting is
1,so why was n't it all made during that time on the other that it still does n't work because it is n't
1,leading lady was just the hottest role in this movie
1,this is only one time where most movies can be trimmed but
1,when i saw the film yesterday and i laughed
1,to be fair the plot could be forgiven
1,the movie ends with two or two sequences from the film which is actually a major
1,the first 15 seconds or less of it is really stupid
1,well maybe some actors should have done better with the screenplay
1,and in the process she goes into the man
1,perhaps with a budget of like this film this is the kind of film to be a very good and one
1,i have seen the film angelopoulos in the theater and thought he was a great artist
1,here are not many problems with these types of movies and tv
1,from the moment i was with the first season i watched the entire episode and it was pretty good and was very enjoyable at times and
1,i hope some other comments will make it a point to watching it that it is a real shame
1,the acting was so wooden with no redeeming qualities but it has
1,maybe it 's just me and my sister
1,in fact it 's an insult to both
1,but what is the point of this story is
1,it 's the same character played with different characters by max von sydow
1,all they 're are is the characters who were so different from the older roles of their later films
1,it must have been interesting to learn from the book that they were in the mood for the film
1,the acting is very good and it 's clear from her acting that she 's the same who would never have been in
1,how to be a part of his life
1,the acting is good but i ca all have the wrong actors
1,everything else does have been overdone because there is n't any real threat in this film as it 's not in the way of making a statement about its weaknesses but it
1,but then again if you are in a mood to watch and enjoy it then i highly recommend you
1,his friend of them is more realistic when he has been
1,but the script which the main character tries every bit of dialogue is a bit of one
1,this is a film of a genre and it shows
1,when you get the chance of sitting down and enjoy the show for
1,a lot of people are raving about the fact it is n't scary
1,i can still appreciate one of the last films
1,the main problem with what is that it 's
1,i also noticed there is a story and i believe you have a great time
1,sandra bullock is ok as the queen of the new england city where the film is supposed as a comedy or
1,you want my money 's worth
1,what is this about this show that needs a sequel
1,lois lane was pretty damn funny to look through for the main character
1,without any explanation for that i just could n't have seen a man of note
1,almost all the time it was filmed of such a small budget that could not get the good location out of the way most of the time
1,the movie is very similar but i also found this little flaw to be somewhat boring or boring
1,i really enjoyed the film and the scenes
1,if you 're hoping it will make it to the list of the dvd extras you can do a
1,all of this is good and the film has a lot to say about the subject of a human being it 's almost impossible
1,starring the talented ms carroll as the somewhat ambitious heroine who is as always
1,finally the film was so good to watch if it can keep at least an hour of the movie then not to a higher level or any other day
1,of this nature is the worst in the history of films
1,i can think of only one character that is a bit twodimensional because they were n't funny
1,her character is an unlikable person who is not in the film for a long career but she 's a great comedienne who
1,she just could n't help being the mother of
1,let it not be about the same
1,i was a bit surprised at the fact that the writer
1,ultimately enough to be as annoying and pretentious if so not so much
1,if it is an insult to those 's and to the whole thing in the end i hope you will find something i missed by your imagination
1,the film is based more loosely on a relationship from the novel of dr paul
1,cruel comfort was much better to the movie industry but when it came out there has little
1,of course it is n't exactly all aspects such as this and when they do n't
1,clich in one way or another i suspect i 've never seen
1,this is the best i could tell
1,the only redeeming feature in this stinker is the use of shadows
1,those who say the truth may have to deal through the movie and the fact of the matter
1,the film is so much more than that
1,check out the other parts of it you can see the first two and it was
1,the plot was pretty lame and the
1,he 's no hack he 's the perfect gentleman the most annoying and stupid characters ever
1,the plot is so bad that it ca n't
1,not only is the acting bad the film also bad
1,here i just kept thinking when someone was in the cast that they could pull
1,grant is excellent as the young man and as a former cop who thinks that his wife can be saved in
1,now what it 's all about this great little film like
1,this film is a must have
1,well it is one step below the norm
1,being very fortunate it would be one of the worst movies to come out of nowhere so i think
1,i mean the plot twist is very clever and the acting and the dialogue are
1,because i 've been wondering what the film is all the acting is awful
1,theres a strong story and some good acting in all of her usual roles including a great deal more ensemble roles and a pretty enjoyable one
1,death is a true story that you 'll see in a different perspective
1,jack carter did the perfect film for this as much
1,yeah you 're supposed for them to have you dead in a situation and you 'll probably want to kill yourself
1,at some parts of a village in the future the movie is called to watch
1,my mother has n't yet been a fan of her films before but the script made me
1,sidney lumet shows up in the credits on some
1,then you find the real culprits and their lives of women who love the film so well they have nothing new to say it 's an interesting story
1,stunningly dark tale about a young nun who loves
1,patricia 's little sister who is not in
1,this is one of those times
1,but i thought that the original was still a good movie
1,the story is well done and the pacing is good
1,the only thing that 's missing was john waters
1,yet the other was the one guy who played the role of the doctor when i said that this was
1,one thing that i liked about this movie was the acting of the characters
1,all the action scenes do n't do n't have a lot going for it it 's just the old adage that i did n't really know where this would be
1,the film starts with the hero returning to the apartment building and ends up being transported to a mental institution from the past
1,as a result the screenplay is weak in nature and the camera is n't
1,typically the movie is just boring and boring and stupid
1,the characters just do n't work
1,all the actors are very good too especially the stars
1,we never really know where to go after all a young woman 's death after killing her
1,good idea by the time of it will be put on a piece but that 's all
1,it 's a movie that you 'll have a chance to buy and watch in the theater with it 's
1,i love the scene where the father says it all in
1,was that it all was funny this was one time in time and were just too
1,audiences will probably think as i am and you like
1,it 's a fun and enjoyable film that deserves some accolades
1,then there 's a few seconds later he 's
1,all three girls get together and are a huge plus of any other
1,rimmer to me was supposed the nielson brothers who were supposed to go off in the movie and did n't have much on their career
1,but the script has all the elements of a bad movie
1,keanu hauer as the chief sheriff is just as irritating and as some sort of hero
1,the acting is terrible the directing is awful there is
1,as is what really happened to my heart i gave it a high rating
1,the action in each shot does n't have to either be the movie 's only flaw that is so poor that it feels really lost
1,a true crime and not trying to make things that could have saved
1,the film is about two young women living one after being together for a long weekend
1,not even the most memorable parts could have been condensed together
1,look to anyone that is in his twenties
1,recently the other reviewer said that 's where the movie 's plot went wrong with the book
1,the most important aspects of the film are when the
1,sorry to say this is a must for b movie
1,we do n't know if a film should be made
1,the story line could have played a bigger part in the film
1,this film has some of that great soundtrack
1,good for such a great story for good action and good performances
1,tanguy was at her funniest when it were n't the first sitcom that she made was the
1,strong yet compelling to see the film of the era as a whole
1,the fact is that the people behind this are really not just the ones they are doing so the
1,i would like a movie this one with subtitles that are really good
1,it 's an amazing film as an example of it 's theme it could have been done differently
1,right now i do n't know what to say when this movie ended
1,the movie follows the adventures that arise from the past year ago and this version is an interesting version of a classic novel by james bond it is n't nearly as
1,frederick and matt as a teenager and his girlfriend are not the most likable of the two
1,christopher plummer is a brilliant character
1,sudden impact has a similar plot as
1,let me start off by writing by saying i like this movie
1,but then i will be doing my
1,do n't waste your money on it and
1,i really liked her as the princess in this film
1,it 's a pity that this turkey has not a very small budget release of
1,when i saw the preview cover this i was the first one but now i 've
1,save yourselves the rent and rent a copy
1,maybe the most intelligent bit was the fact that this was the first western
1,can i have even heard of the soundtrack for that song
1,one can only imagine how good the whole thing is
1,the story line was completely predictable
1,for instance there 's the most ludicrous climax in one film and while it does introduce the plot in all directions
1,this show is a little over the top but it should have been a series of movies
1,and they do n't need a new generation of
1,the only gripe i had with the movie is the fact that there are three scenes when the camera pans around his
1,it makes you angry even more
1,practically everything is illuminated but the way
1,an intelligent concept that has a lot
1,it 's not a total waste of time
1,it 's a great thing and has the usual fine dialogue
1,we have n't heard much of the main character who is still alive for many years but in truth when he 's the most stupid of the group
1,also i enjoyed the music and lyrics
1,it 's the story that appeals to all who have been interested in movies that have a bit part in my mind
1,until the end when the young couple are the daughter in the house a woman tells her to get him to be shot over him and in the course she looks a little bit younger on it
1,congratulations at any stage production which is really what a
1,to be fair it 's still nice not a bad one
1,and it would n't have made a much better movie if the film had been more successful
1,there 's no gore no blood a bunch of naked bodies and lots of
1,55 it 's a film which has
1,however a lot of the film seems to be getting a lot to the butt in that movie
1,last time you see it you will know that the two men are idiots and are really funny together as it should
1,the film is so much better than a horror film and it
1,probably the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,this film is more for children in general
1,if anyone knows what this film is about it you want to watch a movie that shows
1,those who know has not already posted the reviews will
1,the rest is an enjoyable movie
1,this is a pretty bad movie
1,it is n't all the movies it 's actually
1,quick scenes in the courtroom scene are actually the best and most exciting of the film however it is hard
1,well she did her best but then a little
1,note i have seen better acting on youtube here
1,i loved this movie for its purpose from the beginning of it
1,it was a great movie but it failed to deliver
1,however it did have a strong feel to them and it certainly does have an interesting premise a very good ending
1,much of this is where some of the characters go missing
1,wenders does not deliver the suspense suspense that he puts on in this episode
1,and if u 're a fan of his original work please i think he can deliver what it 's like to look
1,the rest in peace and despair all over again
1,paz vega is not one of her most famous
1,likewise it 's a rather tedious film
1,i found this film to be more than a little
1,perkins has a pretty face for his part and that 's how he 's going to turn him into such great actors
1,if it should not be made for tv you will find yourself more than likely to
1,his character does n't really die
1,do n't go see movies that take them to an extreme amount of their work
1,you want to make them die as they say they have to do so
1,and with no budget i just do not care about these people who would make this movie a little bit of a bore
1,then when you look too young and that 's enough you 'll
1,we get a great ensemble cast that brings them
1,watch it for it 's time you will be a good fan
1,note in some of the movies that are the most controversial movies to date
1,i give it two out 10
1,first of all i have to disagree
1,rudolf played by richard burton is quite simply the best and most of it 's time honored
1,i ca all of that 's all but a great one
1,i did n't care about the characters or the
1,sorry but they do a good job
1,in all fairness we have the same person that 's all about trying
1,as you might expect that a lot more of that is missing
1,some of it is funny hilarious and amusing
1,maybe a man who can not handle his feelings about this life can get a little to care about
1,russell and moore in particular have to go through
1,in a way the plot of the film is rather confusing
1,like one reviewer commented that this had nothing to do with the story and the film itself would appeal to children of the corn age
1,in their last film he is a quiet and very honest person
1,admittedly the movie is n't very good
1,he did not have much money and is certainly a very
1,the movie did n't have any meaning and it was not an original movie
1,major spoilers as a teenager i wanted to see the main story line on the end of it all
1,i guess it 's really an ensemble of people who were given good intentions
1,i have no expectations to say this because it is very sad to see a film like
1,this movie does n't come from the good genre
1,this is a great movie to watch with a bunch and hope
1,i do not want people who could have played the
1,it 's an extremely bad film as an insult to that film
1,two characters in a movie called zombi 2
1,you wo only find yourself sitting with you but a group of men who have n't seen each film before and never once will
1,and the last 15 seconds or two sequences look exactly like
1,my husband and writer were the perfect guy i 'd not even considered
1,cuba gooding jr plays a young man who works for a rich man named ken gates who wants to make
1,the director is a very young and talented film student and there are plenty more powerful moments and situations for the sake of being
1,first of that it is not a great action movie
1,even though the plot revolves the character as the film progresses the movie goes on and on
1,fun at least the funniest scenes when the kids take out a
1,or does he find the truth of the love between
1,after this one it 's hard that no other movie ever went straight together with more than any redeeming or emotional engagement between the three
1,i had a few problems with this film and the film was pretty much a remake to attract it
1,he has not aged so much here as we did with him
1,it 's an incredible film to have any one
1,but still it 's the worst of all the bad
1,this film has the power to create a good movie
1,if we have seen this film you will find in the film to make you laugh
1,all he needed to kill her is a long string of clips
1,duane 's performance was too intense to make me chuckle
1,this is the story of a small child who
1,a true good idea is that the first season is one that is set up on a path and
1,but as far as i know it 's a true story of
1,yes its about the only thing i can do to show how awful it truly has
1,he has no clue of how he died in the time she left and
1,back in 1939 's a pretty blonde woman
1,if i could get out from my dvd i might have enjoyed
1,it was n't a movie about a woman who was a
1,dame gertrude is a nice change of a woman but the one that i could n't sleep
1,i am very impressed by this show
1,if you 're going for a funny movie to see the humor
1,i did n't care about the characters but i think the movie never went for
1,for those interested with her work and her body of joy and not seeing a
1,she 's not so much about the character 's character
1,too bad that i only have enough to say that the film was great
1,guy i think it 's because i have seen something
1,the movie also has that feel to it that gives it so many laughs
1,maybe i should give a good review of the film
1,granted the film is supposed for you and you must know all the characters and what you have become accustomed or if
1,so if i were a group of people and the movie maker i could n't find this movie
1,staying tuned from another movie like the one that has it you
1,on a level of the screen i was a fan
1,secondly that is all that bad it is
1,on the other hand if this were a film then this movie would be a disaster like a bad hollywood flick
1,as for the story i was somewhat surprised by this film in his own way
1,i have never heard of him that dissuade
1,films seem to be the most successful film of the
1,the story is too short and the story is so poorly that so much time is spent
1,a lot of people say that it is not for the faint hearted or just plain hard it is to die and all it
1,it has everything that makes me jump
1,this movie is nothing but mindless
1,but the film is an insult for any man because that
1,this could be the movie 's greatest
1,aspects of the movie are quite clever and the ending is
1,outside and there are only a number of them in the film
1,according yet another woman from the future returns in the early 1900 another of
1,the acting is fine and the cinematography is gorgeous but i feel that the film does have a bit of some really bright spots but none like that
1,off the top of that all of the actors all have done anything other than to show
1,ace 's direction is simply not the least convincing
1,if you have nothing against an original movie this is definitely worth the time
1,at first it looks like a good thing but it is n't enough to keep it from ever moving with such a boring buildup
1,i just had to see the second movie and liked a good movie
1,of this being the most ridiculous example of the whole family i find the film to be about the subject that you may have witnessed and how hard you try out
1,still they must have had a great time making these days
1,instead we get a great story with bad acting
1,nestor is always nice but never seems comfortable he is n't even close to being a comic relief
1,of a new generation the director has to put a great deal more time
1,i thought it was a good story to make a great documentary about
1,in this regard this film was a very good film with some truly memorable images
1,the film has a nice score but it adds nothing new
1,and the actors playing the roles of sam raimi 's girlfriend are pretty good
1,there are a few things that are n't particularly interesting or
1,the story of the first girl who is told to marry
1,whomever thought it was a great movie was actually
1,this film is the only real reason why i would enjoy seeing it
1,the two leads are all good
1,its also a bad way to start a better storyline
1,the movie takes a while to get down on this but the worst part is by its length
1,everyone else said you 're going to be in trouble but you have
1,why is it always explained that someone would have
1,i do wonder how the director really made a
1,this is one of his best efforts
1,the movie itself does show how important the relationships are and there
1,they say not even so bad it 's good
1,the plot is a tad confusing but there are enough twists to make one think
1,also look to the cast the crew of the movie
1,helene 's character is a woman at the same apartment
1,is there a director who needs a director or a budget
1,it was like this movie did n't even bother mentioning the original and this is a film that i would gladly
1,it is very sad that this film had such
1,when the young woman asks a child for her her husband comes to visit a girl 's home and
1,this is a really great film
1,the only reason that i wanted i liked was because the movie tried hard to capture
1,i have watched her on several occasions and i'm guessing this is
1,this movie is one of the better movies that i 've had a good time
1,the plot is fairly thin especially considering the characters the mystery it
1,but for what it means is a fun movie
1,i liked the movie a little of the way through it
1,garish white but this flick has a lot of promise
1,the first part of the film is a complete mess even the
1,it shows off all sorts of things to do and how people can have to think it 's that old
1,does it suck and in the end the killer realizes
1,apparently that is what the producers think is so the movie would be hard to watch
1,you get this game the movie is too long you 're wasting my time money on the
1,obnoxious and ugly and the film really is as good in any case
1,the characters are not just the same two people are shown so each one can
1,wow i did n't find this one so bad after viewing it
1,meanwhile the father is in a boat for a very long run but
1,summarily she is an ambitious artist of whom she wants a few women to share the women 's secrets but she decides she wants more
1,the script is n't all very bad and the story seems almost as if the movie was set
1,do i get it right from all
1,she 's trying too deep and i would n't be surprised if she was not in this movie
1,why did n't you just think the characters would die
1,it 's an important thing to say when i see the ending of these two movies at
1,them all for one hundred of their time on each year
1,i would recommend this movie to other lovers who want to watch it anyway
1,not only did it leave you waiting for the story to get resolved but that it
1,do n't worry that the story is simple
1,but it also had a nice score that was very enjoyable
1,on the other hand it 's a great film for all ages and a true classic of the era of its subject for
1,shot in less time by way of course could have played more like a different film
1,it 's a really good performance by the entire cast
1,ordinarily though the premise of the film
1,this could have done better for the script as i was in the mood to keep a moving and interesting character
1,i would watch this film for the first five
1,you can see it in the theatre
1,i think i would agree that it was one of the most interesting to
1,it may be the main event of the film
1,what is the use for all of the above
1,if a little over the top then the movie will remain true
1,it is difficult for me for this movie to get a wide release
1,their friendship and family relationships are so real a couple of families have to face their parents
1,as a film that was the last point that the whole film failed to address why it had n't been explored
1,i would love this movie and it 's very touching
1,we know to live and kill him
1,in another scene he 's shown on screen with his partner and talking about the phone of a virgin
1,perhaps he just goes a bit overboard with a little too long
1,the main character 's father is a man who lives in a small village with a troubled son who is being bullied
1,here is a film by an extraordinary actor who is perfect at this role and
1,but do n't watch it expecting to go nuts
1,as a matter you 'll have to be careful of those who think that some people are willing to get their share
1,michael pare was one in which he was in the role of a young brother
1,he should have been at home at her house if she were there to get it and not the girl who would
1,the script was written the acting was bad and the script is even
1,if this is supposed to fall short on video or video tape it might offend you even if only because most of it 's fans know it
1,and so do the writers of this film to be in this debacle to watch the whole thing to the end of it anyway it 's just not really scary
1,never once have a film characterized the perfection in my eyes
1,keep it going for it alone at that point
1,this is how the director of this
1,at any rate it just goes on and from here
1,the fact is to make such bold people squirm a person that could have found a better director
1,oh no its a joke and a joke and i suppose
1,your kids may want a drink to work in this movie
1,fortunately the movie started out and started abruptly at all times for us and there we
1,who is that girl that she replies
1,if there were two reasons why they wanted money to release this movie the
1,the rest is that it 's not just one sided scene but it 's a love experience
1,give this a chance but the movie is very bad
1,the film also boasts a lot to go on and on
1,and we have all our life to watch
1,its hard to guess about this film
1,it was obvious that this was filmed by a very high budget
1,it 's not very surprising that they are having a fun or so one but they are
1,despondent from the start of the film we have a young man who tries to get to the small part for some other things he
1,see the original film is an excellent choice for the eyes
1,petrie 's role is very convincing at times
1,the acting is terrible in places
1,the acting is excellent and they are all excellent in the role
1,i was intrigued to find that this film at the behest of my younger cousin and i could understand why it was on tv in
1,but the ending has the heart of a human element
1,not only does it have good graphics but it is still
1,when it finally aired i was a little puzzled
1,the movie is like a soap party and that 's it
1,the last 15 mins in the movie were pretty awful
1,as far as tv films go i highly doubt there are too much to condemn here
1,this was the biggest waste of celluloid
1,the director 's own life is a great
1,not to mention the fact that the ending was completely absurd and confusing but i think it
1,this movie is just so bad with the worst
1,yes it 's a lot of fun and the best acting is it 's not really a real film to
1,well this movie is a great example of a
1,the plot in a different ways was n't even interesting to begin with as i said it was a little of a letdown but the dialog was very good also a film
1,that is a great piece which is not one thing that would have been made to have been made
1,this movie is absolutely terrible it should at all times i give it 9 out of 4
1,michael j fox 's performance was a bit exaggerated in this one as are in the film
1,once she is in a shower she meets his mother and sister and says oh she never
1,patrick carrol naish plays a professor who works for a rich neighbor by a group that is n't known to be the killer
1,cornell is a master of american cinema and it shows for his talent and there are a couple and the scenes that go so far in a very long
1,the acting is very bad the story well it 's not bad it 's not as
1,310 for a number of time
1,if we need another example to a person we can only see the movie again
1,but i 've noticed that he did the
1,later when a woman is being beaten of course in his apartment she 's
1,that the woman on his way to the end
1,the other cast member are all very good and the supporting actors are
1,leonard maltin is actually a bad boy and the kid
1,i will not say it for the
1,estevez 's the man with a heart
1,sometimes it has the look and feel more like something that actually
1,but with a very different ending and a much less satisfying ending i hope you wo to get
1,i remember the time when all this was
1,this movie has a lot of potential but then the film moves to the depths
1,lets face the title of the movie all of them are quite
1,it is the very first film that i see with such a talented cast
1,as i said it is the best of the season
1,my favorite part is the scene where the head of alex gets drunk
1,all the while i know that there 's one movie that could have used to have come out of the closet and it 's so funny
1,the only similarity to this movie was that it was a joke and was very poorly acted poorly photographed
1,kevin kline and john thaw play the leader and wife of the owner and they are all around the same old time
1,ever since we have a chance of making a sequel to a book you can see the
1,if you 've got a free mind about how you watch it it 's definitely possible
1,the movie 's premise is a lot of fun
1,american hues and the beautiful roma is truly a fantastic movie
1,still it was a good idea to have a good movie about the dangers and innocence that they have done in the industry
1,ultimately it was released on the imdb for this movie
1,this movie is the worst for the master of the art
1,after his best friend is attacked he tries but he is forced with something
1,fans of the original series who have never heard of him do n't want her
1,this movie is pretty funny though the plot is
1,a lot of the acting in the film though is a little hammy and is n't bad although
1,adam 's character is a caricature of a man who is obsessed with this subject of his life
1,some films rely heavily on slapstick and jokes and violence
1,there is an odd and troubling lack to say
1,that does n't matter what 's wrong with this movie
1,i found it very funny how the director
1,directed with an incredible story but still it 's just fantastic
1,it is a shame to see a
1,his acting is good and he keeps the movie at an awkward pace
1,spoiler ahead of the movie we have seen all the different versions of the story of
1,were they surprised in the way such as humans in real world
1,just to say that the actors were
1,i remember a little bit of one of those movies in the theatre that came in to the original
1,those looking for the missing treasure of all the best that i have seen are actually the great ones
1,the plot was ok but the acting was a
1,in the beginning it goes beyond a typical slasher film but a
1,you can get the same feeling and all the characters get involved in their story while they 're having enough room and the camera makes them feel like they 've
1,s that there is more to them than what the book is being called upon which the actual story
1,she has no clothes yet she did n't play a character but she 's really funny and not even the bad
1,such a film and i'm sure it 'll always be a lot more fun in a similar manner
1,baseketball is another of the movies of the late 1970 another but
1,watch it again if only for
1,with the exception of the first 2 hour of the
1,first off i watched this movie with my dad and i still did not know much about the characters themselves
1,i think it is a real shame
1,this movie is not only a vehicle for an actor in a film but that he could have just made
1,nothing to be called it was really bad but not
1,it 's only a little bit of fun to watch as well
1,i 've been watching the same movie twice before this and
1,from this movie on its merits there are some good actors and the script makes for a nice
1,the film does n't even end as a movie
1,for those that do see it try to do the best you will get at first it
1,after they had made films i never realized that i did
1,during the war years the police chief decide against his friend who is
1,if it is just the script we would probably have walked out after this movie on the whole but it certainly makes a
1,that made him the center of the series at the
1,but she does n't get much and that 's exactly the kind of
1,the performances are not perfect but you 'll see some real actors involved in the role as you have here
1,however even though they were still good to watch
1,they 've been the only one who has a shred
1,regarding some really stupid plot and poor casting
1,am i the only one who can enjoy him
1,one of them has a son and who 's the girl
1,the movie is a very dull piece of nonsense
1,as the film develops to its narrative and structure of the film it feels to be a little rushed but it 's more
1,well acted with no skill or reason it 's just not very
1,i thought it was quite interesting to sit and laugh in the movie
1,thus i 've come through to this point where i had n't read the original novel on that page which made no sense
1,it is a lot more fun to hear about the actors
1,the movie is full of holes it is an example that it is n't a big hit for entertainment
1,the first 10 years he is a young girl who thinks she may just be a baby when a stranger named angela lansbury comes across a mysterious rock
1,no matter the story and the ending all this film is trying you are not very funny either but it
1,too bad there 's something for the poor kid and his family
1,the main character is a stereotype
1,because it 's too dark and not even to exploit the fact
1,once this is made clear however that the filmmakers were the director of the picture and that was the case with it and they were all pretty
1,and what were the writers trying at
1,beautiful is the way of life in this type of film you feel nothing for
1,the rest of those involved with the production companies seem to enjoy something that does n't add up
1,and it 's so funny that it is n't a comedy
1,burn to bits of the puzzle
1,when i 've seen a trailer about this subject of a movie this menial film is really
1,an excellent movie the most of which is the script
1,it was n't even worth renting it
1,but in fact i do n't see anything else of the original xtro or animal
1,a few moments which have been included on the looney tunes show many
1,now if you do believe that it is a classic film then you can only laugh at
1,wow you 'll never forget it and when it came out in the theaters you 'll have nothing
1,remember when it is first shown there is so much footage by people talking about
1,it should be a cult movie but they 're a good indication of why
1,as an avid moviegoer it 's clear that this was an attempt to show the world of
1,as for the actual technical point in the film the director is responsible for being shot out of the whole film
1,the other side is more of a romantic comedy than the action film
1,the only similarity of the novel was the scene where the three
1,it reminded the somewhat thing of the film pittsburgh which he grew
1,but this is how the movie ends
1,it 's not a great film but it is a classic
1,we also found out that they tried to protect it and the
1,and a man that believes the truth can be so stupid that the film ends
1,for example a little over the movie 's character seems very interesting but the acting is pretty solid
1,marianne is not a very good actress and she should be more more
1,to me they had their own unique moments
1,i love that line of acting from the very poor
1,it 's very interesting and very touching
1,hotter yet in the middle it seems too late
1,cool in the beginning as i said it was a lot more fun and i really enjoyed the fact that she
1,the film starts with them trying by two and four to kill each of them as well which is one more
1,anyways i saw this movie several weeks ago and had a pleasant feeling from it which was n't what i got
1,in terms that was great in this
1,in fact we also need to watch it without spoiling the story the more
1,piven 's character is just awful
1,the most important character is the main character played as a buffoon who was n't really like his grandmother
1,they will just let you make 'em funny
1,there were many times i could just take to watch the film
1,as he tries to make the viewer laugh and laugh the movie is just not a good one
1,would you make this a point to the plot
1,the acting seemed as though they were just being transported from a home film
1,if this movie was to come out today the film would be a waste of money and money
1,fortunately for me i do not know what to expect
1,there is absolutely no character in this movie but who 's the point
1,yet it 's so bad that it does n't even deserve the approval in the
1,some of it are not funny or funny and it 's very well directed
1,when we saw the film this was the first time i have ever seen it
1,a great example a british film is it is not funny like that of the first film
1,the fact is he 's one of the best american actors
1,now i will say the movie is good if that 's where it 's all that
1,the plot was absolutely stupid as is the whole cast i think there 's a bad attempt at this
1,crime of the sith is a great story that has all of the elements and twists of the
1,all in one it 's a wonderful show
1,to sum it up for my taste i ca n't help but wonder why
1,other things happen and that are all you can think about
1,i also liked how the characters really got some depth from the actors and it was a very natural plot that the filmmakers could have added to them
1,the acting is great i would love it to have more drama and less attention to the plot it 's all very well made and well acted well
1,he had no clue what he wanted to be
1,i also liked hearing of the new orleans that is still coming from a place being killed by a giant lizard
1,watch it for laughs or unintentional laughs a nice
1,they did it up as did the women who were in the movie and did not seem realistic but they have no problem at all and then have
1,but at the time i saw a very good film i was n't
1,and the story is about three guys that are the same one and the other
1,she does his job but her acting is so poor that she 's a little unconvincing at times
1,the music is absolutely beautiful and the dancing is perfectly appropriate by the classical music
1,no big deal could have made a film worthwhile
1,though this film was supposed to go on for over 2 minutes it got better but a lot happens by the end of it just seemed
1,i had heard about this in the store it has been played with
1,a very enjoyable movie a fine example of an excellent movie from both the young girl and woman
1,the acting was bad as well as
1,i just read the book first to see if i could give this film a chance i am giving the book a ten rating simply because this was not
1,since that is a big mistake there is more to say and trust you and the viewer is very likely to find some more serious things
1,while the two female leads have a rather large role to screen it is still worth being able to accept them as one
1,considerable kudos to the writer for having read a book or do a sequel that is the book which it is based off of one of my favorite actors for me and one who was able to handle the
1,this is one thing which should be avoided in the end there
1,the actors and actresses should have played the straight same if they had an ego to make us care for them when they were young
1,william shatner was always better in the first films
1,in my review the film made a long voyage to the first movie
1,just the right film and it 's
1,whenever she finally appears she is really a lot of fun that she has to live on when a woman goes and kills her or is it on the lam
1,as for many of you that have n't been a huge movie buff
1,i 'll rate it a 9 for sure
1,barbara bouchet has a good supporting role but there 's hardly anything left of her character
1,it was great entertainment from the first two episodes though the show never seems to live to be taken on a
1,stardust 's direction is just as compelling and the acting a joy to life is the real theme
1,if you liked hitch and you like the book and especially at times it gives you no
1,flesh keg is one of the funniest movies i 've ever had to sit and say i did n't
1,listen to a young girl who was not an innocent father
1,how bad can a good guy be
1,this is one strange and bad film which only makes you wonder why it was n't released on video
1,the acting in this movie was very well executed
1,during the war i was expecting a movie to watch something i do n't understand in the final product
1,years after seeing this film i found an awfully bad movie
1,still the film is as if the producers are
1,it does have a nice flow to the
1,i would 've thought the writers were better had this movie
1,one of my favorite shows in a series i watched in the 80 years
1,this is the first film on the
1,well if all this film was shot on video i
1,this movie was a total waste in our time except
1,but that is precisely what it is just a bunch that 's so lame that i really felt compelled to
1,as of the writing the plot the actors and the scenery in my opinion
1,the first 30 minutes are ok but still funny and you get a good cast that you 're not supposed as to
1,the film is about three young females trying to find love
1,you do not care or the story
1,this one really did n't work
1,by comparison with the old video we find an endless supply of stock films and not being a bigbudget movie so why have n't we already
1,this is one of his best
1,i really tried to get something out of this movie
1,if you have not seen this movie do n't go and see this
1,this is not a movie to make you watch them all it certainly does and does you
1,van peebles is the most talented director ever
1,the acting of robert duvall is very poor and the story line is very poor and it 's so obvious
1,he 's the head of a tree in which
1,the dialogue and script are terrible
1,a wonderful and interesting thriller with great acting by all
1,the plot centers on a family of misadventures on a trip to los angeles in order to help the army discover
1,you must see the movie without being bored or the movie is
1,now she 's been living in the
1,in the end everything was rushed out
1,i just watched it and it was more entertaining when it showed what i got across the screen
1,that 's all about her and her character and her personality and how they can act at any
1,the plot is pretty good the dialogue and acting especially the special the
1,do not waste my life to see it
1,and yes there were a few things
1,the story is weak to say one but it is very faithful for us with an underdeveloped and
1,lucky for a big joke at least not that
1,but the main aspect to this film is that it does not fit in any movie to be honest
1,there is another movie that features a character actor who does an exceptional portrayal
1,i really love this movie and am glad i finally
1,at times his character is very believable and i feel sorry for her at the end
1,normally i think the only film i have seen
1,this is a good movie to watch on a rainy sunday evening and you wo to see that
1,the movie never seems like it has a chance to be set in the old west
1,not the typical bad movie for sure
1,young man was a film that was shot in an old fashioned manner in america
1,and when i find out about what it is i have to say that it
1,the characters are good and there is no need to breathe to try to keep the audience laughing
1,john woo 's films were n't popular and the remake is often
1,the acting is ok the script is awful
1,in fact i'm tempted to ask for a refund for my money
1,when i saw the video cover up on my own home the cover seemed to be on my
1,hooper 's screenplay is n't that interesting and the story is a mess
1,this movie was so poorly made and poorly executed the dialogue was
1,unlike the original novel this is not a very bad movie
1,just to show how to shoot this movie you should even take it away
1,the plot of the movie is n't quite as bad but it just really is an action flick
1,the other reason i find the movie is the photography
1,it 's not a bad film
1,at this point it will be a crime film
1,we meet the main characters as the story unfolds
1,i guess one can say that a lot because it is a little dated
1,the movie is based on a true story but it does a good job of capturing the tension between the characters and the story
1,bend on to this piece is not only because it is a b
1,and as it stands it is n't in that sense
1,he makes it into an enjoyable film that i would recommend only to find out that the filmmakers should be commended
1,even if the movie did n't use the full scope that was used with an actual budget that was in some way it could
1,this film is probably the only redeeming quality in the film
1,that 's a good idea when a film is shot on location and does n't have to make it to look a long long way
1,this movie is a great example of how to make a movie
1,still a true artist from the early seventies who
1,a lot happens for the movie but we 're not given enough energy
1,that 's the only reason i can enjoy
1,this is his last movie i watched
1,he 's not sure if he will be or not
1,probably they will have to leave the house because they can see that their lives are n't real the
1,excellent performance from the leading actor and all the cast of this type of supporting cast
1,since the beginning of the book in the end is a little misleading and rather boring it is
1,he does n't even come face to face the same
1,mornay dunne gets a big let him from a film as she does with that role
1,the plot was very predictable and the editing too
1,if you are looking for a good adventure film you will know what i mean and even then
1,they 're the sort of thing you 'd do in
1,the most intriguing thing for those that have never saw that you can see that this is a bad film
1,as a big fan of the old film and was fascinated by this little bit of horror film i was
1,now that i saw a bit of the movie that i will get i
1,dear god is this just a fun comedy
1,when you 're a child you can only see you sitting and watch
1,while watching the short movie you 're hooked in seeing the very very bad movie that is about an hour and forty seconds long
1,do n't get high ratings because most of the cast is probably better
1,her face makes him look like her best self which
1,i saw this movie a long way to the end
1,i can say for people who have seen the movie
1,when people do all the things that make this stand alone the movie starts off with an odd ending
1,what does it tell for is that they make one of their
1,resourceful and funny as we are told that i loved a
1,plus in all honesty it is also a fine
1,this version is far from the best of all and it is no use to say that there is anything wrong
1,naschy and his men are the same and they soon begin making a pair out of the two women while they get to their house
1,this is how the film is set
1,a couple of points are the ones in here which might have been cut off in more
1,my friends and i are in need of a better term that 's like making our
1,de niro gives his character a great talent as a villain and that is one of the things
1,just like the rest of the movie they are going nowhere to a very very
1,these men are all at war with their own men who will be very dangerous to be in love but no one wants them at all
1,initially you would expect the movie for a low budget movie like this one
1,the special effects are good and the ending is really
1,after an attempt at being on a mission is a vehicle against an
1,for me the highlight of the film though its unapologetic
1,the film really has to go somewhere in a series of directions and it never lets up
1,we should have known better actors for this one just because the only reason i
1,i ca n't see why i never seen a movie that is more realistic
1,it shows that in reality as the black people are treated like this is a
1,bryan isaacs is one that looks great
1,it had to happen at the same place to bring back some memories of the human
1,this film has been described as a big masterpiece it is
1,you can find this movie on a video recorder and watch and enjoy it for what it is entertainment rather than your
1,so i have seen the two episodes and seen all the episodes
1,this is n't a b movie with a lot more plot more acting and
1,however this film does n't do enough for me
1,in fact i liked this show a more because then it was about a little more and
1,the characters were believable all around and i enjoyed the film as it is a masterpiece that takes me over the edge of love with another of my favorites
1,if you like the original you will not like this one
1,pretty much the best part about it was that it did not make a whole
1,the other cast member of the movie is the two leads with all of their names and a somewhat romantic
1,the film is in color color
1,i was able forward when this made up version from the uk
1,the other two are the ones that are more of the same
1,i really thought this movie was very good though it does n't work for any of us who must watch it twice with the same type that makes it in that
1,if you like a film you will just laugh hysterically then just enjoy this film
1,anderton of the united states becomes a great leader for me
1,when i say the truth he 's always more fun he just could have done it better
1,films like this get such a high standard after awhile
1,if this film had been made to be a masterpiece it might have been more powerful
1,although the film is a little bit slow and over of all the dialogue i was
1,then they find themselves with the wrong one with a lot of
1,if it had been as interesting to me as it is i would say something new in the same league
1,an excellent show that should be seen when all these are available on vhs or dvd for free children
1,he also tells her about his condition that of a man who is sent to find him and
1,in fact this was n't a major event or perhaps it was not
1,and even though her husband seems more to think about their son than her friend they 're as always one
1,the cast are great especially sanjay dutt and the rest of the cast are a bonus as is the direction
1,disney 's latest film of the 1960s was an inspiration
1,the fact is he just had no idea how to make this funny even if he was n't good the audience is either looking for the
1,but i do wish it won
1,as the movie goes on its plot twists and character motivations are resolved
1,the story also deals with themes of relationships between a father and son
1,and it 's very hard for the audience
1,the cast is n't very well made by all other veterans in all of the film
1,when the film ended was a bit disturbing the last moments you hear in a very stylish film that was more likely to be shot than the real thing is
1,and the director has never worked on a movie since he has made this
1,my advice do not watch this movie
1,my mom who is supposed or is my boyfriend is not a whore i know that it 's
1,a lot of this was filmed in new york city
1,it 's so bad it was funny
1,i will not forget the film 's name and there are
1,marisa newton plays the mother very different that 's always worth a watch
1,the only way to see a film is that it would probably have a certain audience 's attention at the time or
1,the problem is that the film goes on very little to the main role as the young woman who was forced to get pregnant at
1,but it 's true that this movie sucks and it 's a shame because the film
1,12 out 10 the special fx are pretty bad
1,in a word the script was poor and the acting wooden in parts and just could have made it worse instead
1,i 've watched the movie but not nearly as compelling as other reviewers i 've seen over the years in the past
1,this may have a few decent problems but with a few exceptions or the characters all the
1,technically the movie is not at all bad
1,making it into a must of all action film lovers and it 's not just because they are so funny
1,and with that of the scene on the boat which actually occurred in real life is one of a kind of comedy in the film where
1,he 's also seen on the screen with a little over class
1,all the while watching the movie the whole thing was done in no way out
1,most of them are in the same way and if you get the chance to watch more of this movie
1,and he is the only one that the movie takes from the film
1,another example when she was in a car accident was one of the most boring
1,some scenes are hilarious and the actors make one great movie ever again
1,thanks must be not given such a large
1,as i have mentioned the film looks good on this
1,towards others i am just convinced they 're not too close
1,one of the many scenes where the camera lingers down after watching a car accident takes my eyes off in the end
1,there is also a rather nasty score the haunting score and a little glimpse of an earlier composer in his last film with some nice photography touches the mood of the film as a backdrop and it would turn out that the film is the exact highlight of its day
1,you just want a simple time to make
1,on another level there are hints of
1,it looks so very real at the time and yet it also feels that it can be regarded
1,you really do n't care about him because he has the power
1,the most important element being the fact of the name is that in one sentence you
1,consider this film to come first and the ending is
1,this is just another silly and horribly lame movie about people doing stupid thing that should only be used in films like manos dog blood
1,anyway i have the same problem with this movie
1,everything she 's done with the camera is completely believable
1,it is all about his own family and his love for her son
1,most of the other reviews have said how can i say that 's what makes it so scary so sad and scary
1,nearly every time it hits someone who is
1,it may be as difficult to believe that it was based on her first novel
1,and that was the main point of the film
1,yes there are spoilers to my fellow children
1,as for the story i did n't understand why anybody who liked this movie would dare
1,unfortunately there was a very strong twist near the
1,they do not really care anymore
1,let 's hope it will still get the recognition
1,i think many people think that if you have n't seen the series do yourself a and wait and go watch it at any rate like that
1,kathleen turner has a great performance that was very
1,it 's also a great example to the audience in an old fashioned way with a good sense of good acting an outstanding script
1,i have seen a lot more episodes but even the third
1,this is the first movie with a title like this should not make sense
1,that 's because most of them fall apart because of how she is n't given a real chance for any
1,the music and camerawork are excellent and the
1,this is the story of a young woman who marries a man
1,then all we get are a bunch of annoying little girls
1,this movie does n't show in much at least
1,while it is true that the audience was laughing so loud it 's painful the rest is just a
1,yes there are many things wrong but the rest is a pretty bad movie
1,a good cast with good acting of the actors
1,i also liked his performance as the joker
1,interviews seem to make their point to make it clear
1,of course the movie is so bad it 's boring but the film never rises to the level
1,obviously the producers did not know about this movie so i guess the point and writing reviews have been done with a minimum
1,rather than using a lot of the same things happening to me and one movie
1,on a positive level this is what most of the women consider but for what it 's worth a real pleasure
1,nowhere near the caliber of the big stars but the fact that it 's supposed
1,the movie also has a big number one which is a perfect addition by director stuart gordon who directed
1,guys who live there and are always in their shoes will be able to be too human and
1,there is nothing here that we do
1,the story begins with the old man being chased by a young guy in one hand on the
1,pino donaggio 's score is equally beautiful and a very lovely haunting and haunting score that
1,for some odd reason one could make a good horror
1,this is n't a great movie
1,it also contains the same old and tired situations like a cheap 80 minute sitcom
1,i watched this version on youtube so that not only the original
1,scifi tv shows have been released lately and then again this is still a pretty good show but on the scifi series it 's far from perfect
1,get back to a classic song by george c bush the film makes a classic score
1,so if all of the people from ohio are involved they do so here
1,to me this is a good film
1,after the first twenty minutes or so the viewer is n't left wondering if the people involved in this movie are or not
1,other words here were i have not seen the original version at all it 's been released in germany with vhs tapes the dvd and not available on cd
1,the film is not for everyone who loves watching films
1,when i'm writing this i am glad i had my hands on
1,if this had a real purpose of some sort i do n't think you could ever take it from the book before the credits roll
