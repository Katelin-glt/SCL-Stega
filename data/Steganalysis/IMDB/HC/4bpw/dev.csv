0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be

0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put
0,and she ca n't go i confess but drake was a thoroughly enjoyable police

0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere
0,the plot is topnotch in action scenes and setting up the atmosphere beyond more dull

1,first of all i'm sorry but i have n't read all of the reviews on that page
1,in my opinion this is a very well written movie
1,strip in seattle with a little more substance and wit is what keeps your
1,oh and you can see how the story is set in the
1,not only has she 's a bit of a bitch but it 's not the movie to make a point for herself
1,anything is this funny and not the least
1,i had to stop and watch it
1,the acting and story all work
1,every character who is so stupid that you will laugh
1,he was the first and still in the right movie to
1,he does not show us his face in this movie and he is
1,although the ending is somewhat predictable i did n't care
1,i am surprised by the positive reviews posted
1,the film begins to go into a very serious and very
1,i was n't impressed by the acting or lack of direction in this movie but i found
1,i do believe that all the actors did
1,i love the idea that the character has some sort of connection
1,spoofs for example were the only thing that was n't really funny
1,the story of this film has been done so well in many different aspects as well the director should have been able for
1,i was n't in the right mood
1,its only one flaw that i felt was the end of an era of the movie in which to connect that
1,so do n't expect to see a whole lot to see
1,there 's not enough of that in it to recommend it but for me i found this film to a little
1,this is a really good movie from beginning to the end that is a bit disturbing
1,the plot is basically about three kids living together in an asylum
1,so if you have any luck this is the movie for them to watch
1,then again we got the point to the
1,there 's a bit of blood as well as the occasional gore scenes
1,it 's not that i am wrong or to watch it to the end of the show i wo by now
1,this is a very good movie
1,michael keaton plays a tough detective with an unusual and intriguing role but he
1,the whole film takes you through the whole mystery and does n't even seem very
1,everything i know about this movie
1,for example when you get it off to the tune it 's just a movie with lots more
1,and i do think that if i did n't see it in
1,while it lacks the feel it was filmed in and of those that are the most
1,by the end of the film the viewer gets involved
1,a very important film that was also made in the us and early
1,the story is not that bad
1,now there are no more than 3 scenes of dialog in
1,madison was a good actor too
1,in the end this is more of an ensemble piece than in
1,maybe it 's because that 's the only reason for making this movie
1,rusty seems like a young man with a sense that there is a
1,tommy was at his best and probably could have been made for a few people who have always had a decent time
1,only one can take a bit of a twist that makes this a movie
1,the movie is a waste but i can remember it being a film of a good
1,one could also get the fact that they were all making their own way across the
1,granted there were some parts that could have worked but it was never funny just
1,yang 's character is a caricature of a man who has fallen into a hole at the hands
1,there was no chemistry and the characters are so unbelievable
1,an american is a beautiful woman with a heart of strength
1,my son and i were at the front screening of the movie
1,there are a couple of very funny scenes which have been repeated in several movies since the beginning are n't really all
1,most likely the film is n't a good film it 's not worth your bother watch this movie and enjoy that i 'll be a bit prejudiced to watch it a movie on your
1,i just finished watching this dvd
1,sweetly acted in terms for this film it is n't just the two men in the world who seem to have been living
1,father 's sister is killed in one day and it appears that the father is going to get the girl
1,this movie is so terrible that it was even worse
1,mgm does n't seem to want any further cash but that is not
1,but i guess it was n't
1,however the director is a good storyteller he 's a master of imagination
1,the characters were n't bad and they were
1,d the story is a bit silly but it 's definitely entertaining the second time
1,anyways what do i know when someone wrote this comment
1,for me the film is a real masterpiece for all of us who want to be more than a bit jaded and have not only seen it in
1,from this point you do n't get to hear
1,spare yourself the pain and regret to see this again
1,jean gabin is a very good actress and is both the character
1,one of the best things about this show was the way the people in the game were in the show
1,it is one of his most famous performances
1,i was n't expecting to see another movie which has been hailed a long way from the original but
1,the story is about a bunch at a time in prison when the family is threatened to be married and
1,it 's hard to believe that any movie like the punisher of the same name is the only movie which is
1,but this could be a decent show
1,the only thing it can do to save is how the film is a little too long
1,i do n't really want all of the comments on this
1,tonight it has a good reputation
1,the acting is pretty good and it is very well paced
1,ewoks for the most of us are either that
1,but this is so bad that it has to do with tact
1,seeing this movie you 'll probably have something else and i say
1,low production i think that 's saying the least thing about it
1,a very young woman who is not the mother herself is the main actress and she becomes the most popular person who lives alone
1,a lot of the movie was shot in color so i did
1,this makes him more sympathetic to his
1,my friend and i were laughing out of the theater laughing
1,this film was not for me
1,robert downey jr has always found himself
1,but when they arrive in the desert they have to make up a little
1,wows and is the best way to describe this film
1,whatever we are in here the film
1,although the movie has a very good cast and some nice cinematography
1,for a film it 's too violent to be believable to us
1,made for tv movies which are the first movies of all time in the life of a man who 's in an element on a
1,by now i'm going to get my criticisms right that a good actor can deliver the same lines but you will be glad to
1,is it really that bad after all these years and so much more
1,this was a movie that was a great
1,but the film has a few funny aspects and there 's some good laughs
1,a movie with a plot which you will like
1,the cast and crew of this movie were very good and i think the movie would have been better if the actors and director were writing
1,to make it worse this was a terrible movie
1,if it is true to that i ca all think i would be able at that in my head of this kind more
1,friz freleng is a wonderful actor and
1,the characters who are also the ones i did n't enjoy
1,three guys in a row that are in a hospital in a remote building where they
1,that 's how much this film 's story
1,it 's just that a lot has been done
1,it is a beautiful tale of love betrayal and a tragic journey to a new era
1,her character was a good choice for her character
1,a young woman who is married to his mother and son of a woman and his wife
1,like a great documentary on the first
1,which is a shame since its release here are not very
1,a couple of other characters have some nice moments but i felt the movie had a lot
1,this was a great game for the family
1,this is the kind of movie you 'd want out of all time 's worth watching
1,so much so that i have seen it twice now but now i have
1,sometimes a movie would show you that this
1,several of the stories are too long for my liking
1,count 's father and son are both the youngest and his parents the mother
1,the acting is bad with bad guys on the screen
1,the acting was horrible with wooden and
1,it is a great story with great performances
1,it is an attempt to capture the real life of this movie but the people who think it
1,as far from i have seen it a couple times it 's pretty boring
1,it 's the best show i ever saw
1,joel woodard was good in his role as a gangster who was caught by a man who 's been trying too hard
1,he has an amazing talent of the film which is the best performance ever
1,the only thing that makes this movie so bad is that the ending just is n't good
1,half of the plot is about a guy
1,donald cuthbert gives a solid performance although she is not as good as her character
1,just for the sake to be a movie i 'd have to rate 10 out of 100 just for being an
1,she was a little too much and i loved her
1,lol and not the only people have
1,as a director i was bored to tears and even bothering to watch all of them through the whole picture which i suppose was not made even if they were n't in some scenes but it is n't a movie
1,being a movie buff myself and my partner i decided to pick this up because
1,in fact this is a great movie
1,i did not know that the plot would have any impact on me but my friends are laughing hysterically in this show
1,they were not able to show a complete piece of the time machine and it 's still
1,it also has a great soundtrack great
1,if you have n't seen this movie do n't bother
1,fine acting by all involved makes the movie watchable
1,we 're led to believe this has been all the rage that they have for their lives and its inhabitants as well as the real estate in their home
1,matthau who plays the hero is excellent in every role she delivers
1,victor is a man who thinks the best way to survive
1,then we get an idea of what is going on
1,the story itself was n't exactly interesting but it was pretty good
1,the acting is great and there are some interesting characters
1,how about that there you have it
1,it is difficult not to waste your
1,it 's hard to say how many times you have been able to understand the whole story
1,when i heard that the show was released in 1988 i was shocked with it 's own agenda and a lot and i found it to be
1,though the script is not as funny a few scenes are quite funny and the story moves briskly with lots of
1,whoopi goldberg is absolutely terrible in the film as usual
1,not that it was funny enough so that all of the comedy 's audience will enjoy this one
1,the plot is n't a complete waste by the fact the movie has a plot that
1,i do n't even want this to show on the screen
1,how many of us are willing with what is on their minds and if that 's only it really happens
1,dad and daughter are not a big hit in their lives but it is a great
1,i was a fan of david cronenberg 's work with the
1,a must see for people who like the genre
1,however i really do think that this was a film that was n't afraid
1,she then is n't that attractive
1,got to that point because we were so happy to end it
1,she was not in the least successful
1,another thing that i think was the fact was that it was just
1,that it was shot by the same guy who made it to my own eyes
1,we all see this movie as an example for the first movie
1,i would like to say this show sucks
1,overall it 's a film that is n't bad its just boring and
1,according the imdb rating and the way they look and how many times they get out of the film and give them the
1,i do n't want to spoil it with this one
1,there are a few moments you will probably notice in your face
1,the film was also shot entirely for the sake which it seems to be to make a
1,they 're not all as bad at the end
1,the only problem was the ending
1,so it 's just a shame that the director was too busy trying to create a sequel
1,he does not make his life too well but that 's all he is
1,once there irreversible 's a group of scientists who have been trained by their own lives in space
1,there have been some good movies like this for a while
1,despite its lack and the overall score of the story is really bad
1,was it just me or what 's the deal in the story
1,there was a lot of gore in the movie and even
1,soon he and the others are killed
1,ben stiller is excellent and the cast is great
1,some of them are just plain weird and it may be the movie that they
1,and the fact that they are on a
1,if he had a chance to show us that he is going to
1,i do n't think that it could have been much worse it just had
1,as for the plot it was just plain awful
1,if you do n't have a shred in mind this movie may be a bit of fun as you might enjoy the fact that it is
1,still the movie is pretty funny
1,i 've seen most of movies that involve them and
1,instead of giving up his character to become a big success and his
1,i have always enjoyed the fact it was so funny
1,essentially it is the worst movie of all
1,second the characters were a joke of a man who really had no talent for what they would have done in the movie and at least the
1,these guys are so good i have to say that they are good actors and this film is really terrible
1,at least not that bad just not funny at that
1,oh that really is n't the thing
1,there is no such thing as a comedy
1,it 's so bad that the characters are
1,this movie is a must watch as well as a film of
1,also the movie is about a guy named jake who looks a little
1,it seems like the filmmakers just decided to write this movie and it 's obvious that this is n't a film
1,i'm amazed that i spent a week watching this movie
1,he also meets up with the king
1,the story is very basic and is full of twists which make you hate this and the way
1,motion and the plot twists make you think a bit
1,in this film we see an older woman who seems very interested and she adores herself
1,you know it has a heart of heart to it
1,it is an odd little film that i have just
1,in other words the dialogue is stilted
1,i would have loved to play this character on a show if i had n't been able
1,not that he was a bad person
1,a few years after the release and many other things in the story are a joke the actors are really awful
1,the first two minutes are really funny and they should be put away
1,i'm not going into this film
1,however if the only thing that bothered us watching this mess was that it would
1,the story has its ups in the last five minutes or so and the action is fast paced
1,the acting and directing as well as the cinematography and editing are excellent
1,and the acting for the first half is a bit stiff
1,the characters are not so great and this was a pretty bad movie if not for all the
1,his son is so annoying that even his own parents seem not to notice to him
1,because i was so disappointed when it came on tv i felt like
1,this was the first of the series series
1,extra of the characters are likable people who are so funny that you have to wonder why they all are not likable
1,malcolm mcdowell has the voice of a character in that piece of paper a man who believes that the woman that he loves is one of his friends
1,the script is n't all that bad
1,but you can get in the way of this film and if there is one thing that will do with it 's original title the entire movie is a bit of a letdown
1,the movie is about as much as if i 've been on a mission on tv i do n't like that
1,i 've read a couple comments that stated the acting is a bit overdone to me
1,it 's really a pity that it never made sense to the audience that we were n't actually
1,now they are a bunch and are able to make a big leap for each and every day
1,ever since this is made to be a classic film with a lot of laughs and a
1,fozzie green has been the worst actress of all time for years and her career has gone through a lot of bad choices in her acting
1,in fact all the supporting cast was also excellent except for a few who were
1,there have been other movies that have not even the same premise but are so utterly dull that you ca
1,ok the movie was a little boring but its not very good
1,what a waste that is the only redeeming
1,the actors play well and seem to have no talent
1,i had never heard of this show before
1,i thought i had watched this film as being in my youth that was a good thing
1,stanwyck and the other supporting characters are
1,but the rest stop is a very bad movie the
1,it 's very difficult to find the story to do to save the day with a pinch of the original
1,three thumbs off from each frame
1,the story is a little farfetched
1,but the film is about some of the
1,it 's the type of movie i can tolerate and not because the plot is
1,director robert altman was in my top ten of his movies and this is one of his best movies
1,not only was it meant to shock
1,a lot more than just the normal plot the characters seem to be just like people 's faces in a movie
1,a film about the adventures that were made on video
1,this movie had everything that made me want to
1,show me that this is an absolute gem of mine so i wo n't have it again
1,bare eyed is not only my favourite movie i also liked and this
1,refreshing to see a good director who knows that the movie
1,with this in mind the filmmakers have succeeded in bringing the film to
1,the story line is not as complicated as
1,because if you want to see a movie that is worth renting and seeing this you will be surprised
1,just because of the way things were done they were also the characters and were real realistic
1,the film is a very entertaining horror film to watch in the end
1,do we just want to see a movie about a young girl who is trying too hard and
1,unlike the original it 's one of a kind of film about the perils that come in the early 1900 years
1,although the characters are not all that funny and the characters do seem to be there there is more about them
1,it 's not that the film has such a poor cast
1,likewise there were many scenes that were very predictable
1,scorcese 's film is an epic story of an artist and
1,the only thing this film has to offer are the very good costumes and locations
1,so why does it always work out why does anyone make such a great movie
1,theres spoilers but there are so many things wrong and this makes
1,the first is a movie that 's a lot more exciting than that of the other sequels
1,what is this supposed point of the film
1,during that point the film takes place on a sunny goose
1,this is not a movie i wish to miss but i 'll try
1,casting as usual is a great touch and a perfect casting choice
1,laurence olivier stars and the rest of us will get the feeling that he is n't the only one who is willing
1,for instance that is the only reason i can recall the fact that there is an obvious lack thereof
1,that said the movie was very poor i do
1,the plot is about love and the city girl and how she can fall
1,the acting is pretty good and some people say that this was bad
1,elfen nam was a great adventure film with excellent acting and a
1,he is not in this film
1,you do not have the feeling that the people in it are just desperate to walk through walls like that and that is n't a bad thing
1,it is a very bad movie
1,here is the story for a young boy who works on
1,gotta be the most boring thing to be made in the first place
1,an interesting film that is the first in the long line
1,on the other side of the law i was n't afraid he did n't have
1,but it could have made for an easy and worthwhile
1,the first of them the two men are not even
1,and i would like to know why a sequel to
1,suddenly after the film finishes with a very young man
1,valjean does not need to be the only person in a prison that has
1,against the backdrop this show is an extremely good piece
1,it 's not a movie that i would watch but if you like the movie then i suggest
1,it would be good to see a sequel by
1,by that i mean there was no real threat to the movie for me because you never
1,100000 has one of the funniest casts ever in the business of cinema
1,john wayne 's performance is the most perfect in this film
1,how could the two protagonists find a man
1,taken from a different perspective this movie has its own faults
1,if you have to see them to be an avid fan do n't watch it because it 's an action film and they are in one 's way of making a movie that has
1,i do n't think that the best part
1,in some scenes i was reminded to see a sequel to the great gatsby series
1,it 's not the kind of movie that would have made it a lot more interesting if i
1,the only good thing about this movie are you
1,he 's just too much in love with the old man he 's been and is n't
1,gerald and john are in fine sync with the film 's protagonist and this is a very good
1,it is not a bad movie it 's not bad it just does make fun and fun
1,most people will probably enjoy the film but it is worth
1,the only good thing this movie had is it 's bad bad bad
1,one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
1,and there is a plot that is very believable and believable but the script is really
1,they 're not as smart as the other ones
1,and the story is just about the love of her life and the other two are about in her own way
1,first of the time the film finally got started a good start was actually released in 1980
1,and it 's the same old stuff
1,here the film was an experience to me
1,there have been a few changes from the movie in this film
1,for me what the film does have a very
1,each one of us is a true artist
1,at one point there 's a scene where he 's sitting on his bed on the table of a dead woman trying a scene to a night in the back of
1,at this point i was really irritated as it would have been much less interesting
1,just remember that the movie is based upon a true story
1,i have to say that the main character was a very sympathetic character
1,okay it is not all bad but it 's really bad bad awful
1,very funny movie with plenty of action
1,produced and directed in a manner that is an original version
1,yeah i 've seen a lot better
1,i think the best part of this movie is that it has a lot of
1,the script was not even original
1,although a lot of films about people being abused are not particularly memorable and therefore i was quite pleased by the
1,henry fonda is perfect in the role of harry in this film and i hope to learn more from him and he makes a strong character as his wife 's lover who is in fact a different actor
1,there have not been a good deal of horror lately
1,they even had the nerve to put in for the first two thirds of movie because they were
1,it is a film that can be
1,the story was pretty good and the characters did an excellent acting
1,there are some parts where the film seems to just
1,the ending is so abrupt as a result of a ridiculous
1,however the whole movie is a joke and not very enjoyable at the end
1,by the way a few people are just trying to do anything about the world and
1,in the first episode you have a young actress who is a bit of an actress
1,there were so many things wrong with this movie it was boring to me
1,british cinema director ang morris makes an effective cameo on a daily screen and is a very underrated
1,i was also surprised by how awful a film can be
1,which is the worst thing i 've done that
1,this movie was great it is just a lot of fun
1,but it 's all about the acting
1,all the actors were really good
1,watched the movie and the first 15 minutes after seeing this movie was so much more than i
1,associated with the fact he was n't so stupid i felt embarrassed
1,it would be an interesting and difficult subject to say a movie like this
1,i have not seen any of the books on this website since i first heard of this one in a hurry that was shown as part of
1,this was the first film to have a sequel to this film
1,go rent this movie for a laugh and enjoy
1,if you want a great film then rent it or watch the original
1,nonhorror is a good guy but they did n't show it to a bunch
1,if you are in the mood for a funny good and
1,what you would think was a very good documentary about a guy being strangled by his father
1,keanu hauer and richard pryor have been very menacing
1,so if you have a taste of this film
1,a film that should be released as soon as possible is a mustsee for the eyes of all involved a classic gem for a long time ago
1,paige also gives the first two
1,this film has to be one of those
1,besides it has a good cast and a really great story
1,but the film is n't very interesting at all and it is also very hard to find a plot or story
1,so the two begin to go into oblivion and the
1,it is a beautiful movie that you wo
1,the plot in this movie is very similar to a series where the main characters are in a coma
1,incest is what the show does but
1,the cast is good but the characters and the situations of
1,and i did n't like it either
1,the only character worth mentioning is the way he gets back from the dead of the apes in that he 's also a very handsome guy
1,but if you enjoy the original film it will be too easy to follow
1,mathieu 's mother is a real mother a man who is not in love with
1,we see that the film is not only one or more of the
1,henriksen is one of those actors who ca n't act and that is a big mistake
1,foxes is a movie that has been a great success for the past 20 years
1,here i think that it must have made
1,he has a long long line to work with
1,aykroyd has to make a good movie
1,so the only way to get a movie made was a bunch of kids who could make money in the industry of school
1,however the movie really works at all
1,well it 's an important part but in
1,the plot of the movie is very interesting and there 's some great acting in
1,my only complaint was that the characters were a bunch of clichs
1,there is n't a single word that has any redeeming qualities whatsoever so why did i waste my
1,and i love how the two men react in the very end because they do n't know what to believe
1,anyway what really matters is the movie itself
1,it is n't long after that one of the three sisters arrives after a man 's sister appears
1,the main problem with the film was the casting of a group of young actors with a script which is n't all that
1,i really wanted my money back
1,i had not even laughed so bad that i could forgive
1,millions in time and then the whole movie comes together like a bunch and the audience is n't even that interested in the
1,the film is also very funny
1,funny and funny at the same age
1,and as for the rest it would 've gotten worse as it went along in such a short time but hey so is the film 's ending and a couple of scenes that have
1,and if you are the only person on
1,she had a great talent ahead of her
1,pick a guy a movie camera and you 've got that
1,some of the acting is awful except for the camera work on the
1,they just ca all of them have an eye on each other
1,warren beatty in particular is great and is great as always
1,i was surprised at how many things in the movie
1,this may have been a movie with the exception of a bad film
1,3 the movie is about three families living in the same hotel at a party
1,the only real gripe i have was the constant lack of a
1,this is a movie that has absolutely none of a plot
1,the first is the fact that it was shot in the same location and the movie made a long time
1,i was expecting my mom to watch the movie
1,contrary to those who are not really interested into the work
1,without giving him any kind of power he would make it a good
1,hurley has a very small role as a very beautiful actress in this film but it 's all pretty forgettable
1,i had no clue what this film had going on it is based around
1,finally the plot of this movie is so bad it makes one
1,the director 's vision is very poor
1,i thought that maybe it is unfair that this film is not as powerful as
1,the only good bit of trivia is the song
1,this is n't a bad thing as
1,el mariachi is one of the finest movies i
1,throw the blame into this film which is really what the film is trying for
1,we can only laugh to see that in this movie there is no such a character in a movie that will
1,this was a very moving piece and there are some good scenes
1,his character had a certain charisma
1,they should also have a few episodes of some scenes and then
1,the characters are likable and the cast all have a great chemistry that it
1,i saw him in his role with some of the same actors and his wife is in
1,in fact the movie did n't have much to do
1,the actors had to play their roles well so they did n't
1,the story is told by some of three people from different perspectives
1,you do yourself a favor that makes it work
1,but then she 's a young girl that is n't even a
1,i have the vhs tapes in their home dvd 's library which makes me think about how the film should come in
1,oh yea i ca least go to the
1,this was a really great movie
1,definitely this film was n't in the top 250 as it was a low budget film
1,how does he lose the throne
1,watching the movie i was very glad to find that this has no meaning
1,i do not understand why anyone would want to sit in such an obvious
1,but if you have a choice to go see this
1,perhaps it was the fact i did n't really care for him for the rest
1,the plot twists the characters and situations are not enough to make the movie even remotely interesting or scary at
1,i'm not going to write a comment but
1,sorry i saw that movie and was amazed at how bad it was to the eye of a child
1,reading that 's how i felt this was n't supposed to be
1,i do n't really know how the
1,finally this is the best example of a horror movie i 've ever viewed and i can think
1,the only thing good about this film are other scenes of the film 's plot
1,but i guess i would n't be too surprised
1,you know i am in for some interesting moments of
1,the film is an entertaining film that is not even funny
1,and if you liked any movie you are n't
1,the first episode was an awesome episode of season 1 episode
1,this is a movie that will be forgotten for many years
1,made this a few months before the opening credits i
1,you will find yourself thinking about it
1,will we just go to bed or
1,other scenes are a little contrived but as
1,still it 's the fact the writers were n't so sure what they were making up for
1,some people say that the movie was made so early in that movie it did n't need to
1,jamie foxx was brilliant he was n't perfect for his role
1,it is a simple little piece of
1,a lot like the other two films i have seen
1,the only thing really related is that he just did not look like he was in
1,it was just the same old same crap that i used to watch
1,i do n't know why i never got tired of making the movie to
1,j carrol naish is perfect in the role as the bumbling but loyal
1,i ca n't wait to see what the director intended in this picture
1,i'm glad i rented it for free and then let me go back
1,standout acting and excellent acting especially by all
1,and why do n't any of these
1,just as they are being chased and killed by another person they
1,interestingly the film begins to get very confusing quickly because of a couple of moments that are far more interesting
1,the story is very similar and interesting and does not take a single turn as i am a fan of hers but i do n't find it very funny
1,you can tell when they have a chance to leave the
1,all in one great and one of the most memorable film in all the genre
1,a lot of good ideas that happen to them but they still make the film worthwhile
1,most people i know they will not find love in this movie is probably the most important point as the movie portrays
1,i was surprised how the movie ends
1,i think the film would be one of those movies that will appeal only to diehard hollywood conventions and a bit of it
1,could n't have been more effective
1,the story is quite simple and the
1,believe it you 're in for a treat and you ca just make the point that
1,the story is a little weak
1,a woman is raped and murdered by a group of other people
1,one of the best movies i can think of
1,the movie was shot in that much and the acting
1,the movie is a great one in the right way
1,after reading this i had to check this one
1,one of the most annoying movies of all
1,and that is where all it gets is for the first few minutes of it that it 's about time you get what we have
1,subtract for one minute of the film
1,they do not do so to get in the middle of the movie because
1,i have seen that one over the last 10 years
1,instead of having a party at the video club the only reason i could go is that they have done a good job
1,no one was ever able to convince me
1,it 's very difficult that you can see the movie and the acting
1,i have been watching a number of episodes since
1,i am not a gamer but i'm
1,the story revolves on a group named the mysterious man named kenny
1,the film is an embarrassment for anyone who has ever read a movie
1,eric is the daughter who had a onenight and a son that they had to go out and get married
1,is he really supposed to be a real person in this film as he is
1,obviously this film was made by people
1,the only positive note was the soundtrack by the name
1,she does n't seem too concerned about sex at all but still does n't really understand
1,at one time a young child returns to her house for a
1,well the first one was just a mess of a movie
1,this was one of his very few movies
1,your friends are going for their money back
1,we get the feeling of a very dark and loving film about the human spirit
1,now this is where they find the right one of them
1,watching this movie was one to get a laugh
1,i just had to watch this movie again and thought i 'd never seen another lommel movie again but i 've never understood it
1,even with the cast that is also not quite good there 's no need to spend much money in their jobs
1,it is a simple story but it 's really the kind that makes it so good
1,since it is the story of a boy who lives in a small town with all three friends
1,try but it is definitely not
1,my husband and the other children were still waiting to watch the whole film
1,i did n't like that the little boy was killed and his parents got killed
1,the first half is pretty good and the ending and the end is what
1,with no apologies to a story i can
1,it was n't until i saw it that i had already seen it
1,brave people like this are a little too common to be true
1,i saw the movie in my late teens and i did it again
1,in my book the producers of film were the producer and the director
1,she does nothing but irritate and kills people around her
1,yet we are treated to the main character being a hero
1,i do wish that the director was the one at a scene and a scene where he had the film in front of the
1,that was a real mistake and was so much better than the movie itself it was the best i have come across of my
1,if you 're a horror movie lover you can definitely enjoy
1,she has a boyfriend who has been in prison for
1,here is how it 's been described a comedy
1,the acting and the music in this is so bad it is laughable
1,bridge on this one is an extremely funny and funny movie with lots
1,the only good thing i can say about this film is that the story is not the best of
1,with the cast i could n't help wondering how the director could even afford to tell him the real world that he has been
1,and in the end it 's a real bore in that this game is a little too
1,it 's the kind that the most famous american movie produced but this one really is n't for you
1,i have to be honest i enjoyed watching this episode and i liked it
1,golan 's character of course is a little too unlikable
1,the actors who made it to the audience were very
1,however this movie just does for my mind does n't exist as a great deal
1,the story and characters are just plain shallow
1,however i still feel that this was the worst movie
1,life is also in the right place
1,he 's the leader for his crimes and that he will get the big bullet on the eyes of the president
1,the only redeeming factor about these two films are the performances by both goldblum and his character
1,however it is not just the story line but
1,i do n't recall the scene in which the kids are talking about the girl or
1,the story starts out slowly as if the writers were trying to create characters that are not interesting enough
1,and i can imagine that all the actors do n't get it
1,in the end the director tries to make the audience feel that the audience is the victim of an old fashioned woman who is in love with her but it is
1,they 're not in the same building as
1,while he 's not always playing the same role as the first one he was great as the one
1,this is a really good movie but
1,inevitably it has not been released since its a good film to watch
1,sure this is a good movie with plenty in its heart but it has so many things to say
1,dolph and clark kent had a good match
1,harry is a very talented and underrated actor
1,the main problem with this episode has is that i really wanted more but it was so bad that i had
1,those who saw it in the theatre are still left wanting something to happen and it may well be too harsh
1,i'm glad it was n't even available on
1,it is a movie that will leave you feeling depressed and
1,since a lot has been said to me this movie is an awful attempt at
1,a very funny and entertaining drama but not quite in the first class
1,its not a film with all the actors and the locations and lighting is pretty good even in low
1,did n't anyone involved any good luck
1,this is the story that will blow the viewers out
1,cheesy special effects and some of the worst scripts i can recall
1,the acting and plot is a real mess with a couple being chopped up
1,whatever you think of the movie is like a cross
1,also this is not one of those movies
1,although it is an excellent film it is not the same thing but the way its presented into the lives of two individuals and a third
1,film noir stars include the old guy who plays a man of his time and his girlfriend is the daughter of a child 's home played by a very handsome young man
1,he 's very much like the old guy
1,it is the same story told from the first movie into a movie
1,oh yeah it 's a little bit ridiculous
1,sam neill and david walliams were good in this movie
1,i would n't expect this film to get as good reviews here as i had to see it
1,and in the end he was a little nervous
1,what a waste that it is
1,the plot is a bit of an excuse
1,i was not impressed by the way the film was presented in which the story
1,when she finds out she 's not only in the apartment
1,considering it 's the most obvious film i 've seen that 's not the only movie that does
1,i had no idea that the film was going through the motions
1,it was a real treat for those involved
1,strong performances by the three leads make this an absolute must for children
1,his only real estate and he gets to know the woman from the heart of being a woman and he has his head in a
1,it 's an entertaining little movie and it will be much more
1,she looks for some time with her mother on her way to the top and she is sent to prison to save her life
1,i think the movie just looks very real and it shows
1,to sum it all up i was bored
1,and this is a film with so much more than a
1,of course they 're a good bunch of bad people
1,but i still feel a sense that he is a little bit smarter than he is
1,the film is not as good as the first but it is still fun to see and so many good things in their movies
1,according to the imdb comments the acting was very poor and the actors and crew looked like they had a lot of the money
1,the story revolves around two families who are sent to the party to escape the town and get married by a local police
1,obviously the writers knew that this had a really big budget
1,overall this movie is not worth seeing if your only
1,he makes the same mistake as the one responsible for the movie
1,martin sheen plays a character who is
1,another problem with this picture though is how the filmmakers do n't get a point
1,the acting is poor and the plot lacks any sense of suspense
1,a real shame that this was n't as bad to everyone involved and as the other reviewer said the director has not done much research of
1,it 's not that the movie is so bad they make it a bad movie but the performances are bad
1,adrian pasdar is very good as a tough guy who gets
1,they should have stayed there and made the movie more realistic but i
1,this is a movie that is worth a view
1,if one is going the most important movie about a movie is it is really a movie
1,meryl was the most popular in hollywood
1,it is a shame that this movie has been cancelled in theaters since
1,to give the film a score is a little misleading but a little too slow
1,other people will know who the killer or the characters are but do
1,people have n't got this movie
1,but the fact that it 's not the movie that is n't the only reason i can give it 2 points out it is good but not a bad movie i do n't know
1,i could n't figure out why he did n't do it
1,pod man has been the best of the films by jacques tourneur 's the great the devil and
1,there are other characters that are n't even
1,he 's trying to make a deal with his brother
1,i was not expecting much in the movie
1,the first half of this film is a joke
1,horribly acted the acting was awful from the first scene i have watched this movie and it was a
1,oscar nominations i have n't seen a lot of people
1,the film is n't for everyone especially fans of the books
1,while the film is obviously a good thing about the acting its story and the characters are so much fun it 's a wonder that the actors who
1,when he learns about her past we are not talking to herself about
1,and the rest of the film was just a big mess of how the hell does the killer have to kill himself
1,not even the acting the plot and the whole script
1,there are a few of their problems with the
1,okay i know that 's ok for it but i am sure that is what it is
1,the only good bits of the movie were the scenes
1,i have seen a number by tim curry and they were in for a great treat
1,try the best in this movie for the first time
1,he 's a man who is a true man in the
1,yes there 's a very good reason there 's a third of the original but that 's pretty
1,the acting is a bit stiff too as it goes with the director
1,i ca n't wait to see it
1,william hurt is an amazing actor
1,acting is great as well as the directing which was n't
1,it 's one of many pointless and unfunny scenes the movie 's only saving the mark
1,generally they do n't have the power to make any sense of
1,and the rest stop on the same level as the film
1,the first was the last one and then the second was a very good sequel which did a good
1,the movie begins with a bunch and a lot
1,the only saving grace and the entire movie is a total disaster
1,the story is a little contrived but it works for you
1,it 's a real treat to see her play in
1,in fact it 's not really easy on
1,a movie that should be seen by those interested with the same people with the right wing of
1,i ca all agree that in my reviews this one has its funny moments
1,what a great piece it 's and that 's why people should watch it and then
1,and that is where the suspense is derived
1,the acting is great though some viewers will find it slow
1,i was really into this movie in the 80s and i never really understood why it was
1,it seems to be the norm and a good deal of money to make it interesting or
1,fantastic job by a young man who 's a great actor and the film also looks interesting
1,it 's not a film that is worth a viewing
1,of course the first thing that i would love to say is the lack any time and the plot is
1,and it was n't a very nice time
1,yes we 've just witnessed him and her dad who also loves a woman but it 's too much
1,15 's the best part about them is the
1,the characters are onedimensional even though they have some funny scenes
1,connie 's relationship with the main lady was n't that of a child who was n't very believable and very uncomfortable because she 's a good girl and her acting is
1,the characters are all shallow and undeveloped
1,leslie caron was a very funny actor and was not only a great actress but a very good actress
1,in this case the movie has a certain creepiness of what the director intended
1,i thought this guy was going crazy and he could not act
1,the director of the series obviously knew how good it really could get
1,i had a huge headache and the movie did n't get a bit boring
1,well it 's a little bit too easy to take to the genre but the
1,there are some good examples of this show in the first 15 years or so but then when a new show came on tv i got tired
1,feel free for him as an actor for the film
1,i am sure you are watching a film that makes you think of the world war 2 in which a lot
1,i did however find myself wanting it in the way i had it
1,the film was made in 1980 and the early 90 's
1,of course there is a lot of good action and plenty there are enough twists
1,let 's hope for something more to come out it is a good movie
1,okay maybe it 's a little corny but it 's just another boring and boring horror film
1,you see them are being held with by their
1,cause for the same reason i could n't get away but in case i could be my mom who would n't have made the same movie that
1,salma hayek was also the most talented woman in the movie and in
1,he is a master who 's been the
1,the story follows a group with all of their usual jobs from the very core of the film
1,it 's a shame that it gets a dvd for free or at least not on the shelf at the
1,this movie is not worth a watch
1,nothing is said in a way that the film has been directed in
1,camp is the worst horror movie i 've ever seen
1,the film does n't have to be the least bit of that either
1,ultimately the whole thing is just another excuse
1,the story of the story is told so well that it is
1,haters like me i ca all be entertained by the movie as it is
1,joseph gordonlevitt is a joy that is not to be missed
1,but i still feel like i would
1,seriously i do n't understand the logic of the whole story for that it is not a bad or interesting plot but it does n't quite pull it off
1,i'm sure this was not a good idea to have the writer
1,this is one film worth renting
1,good luck by the director john boorman
1,passengers of the world is a great film it is great film to be sure
1,but the most surprising part of this movie is the way the film is
1,the story is about love and friendship and friendship
1,i had been wanting to see it to the beginning so we were n't going to get
1,that 's when it 's revealed by the end of the picture the characters are n't really trying to explain the story
1,i think that this film will only appeal that anyone else should be
1,the film is very long and does very easily not in a way
1,this is the worst film i have made my money
1,to call it a documentary about an unknown man is a wonderful idea
1,it 's a nice movie and it 's fun to watch
1,my favorite scene in this film was when the two women were shooting the car in
1,the main character 's father is a very
1,now this is n't a good thing
1,as for his being a good film he is very
1,watch the movie and you 'll have to see the ending
1,in one scene in the film the young man says he was in the movie theater and said he was not that bad
1,i love the fact that this movie
1,i did not think i knew anything of the movie except that the people were making up their mind when they were so good
1,i'm not exactly sure where to start
1,as much more of a fan of the movie in the us i
1,he is an actor and a good actor
1,le cercle nikita was a fantastic movie
1,she is very good as the mother who seems a
1,in the beginning i have nothing better to show
1,and when this woman is trying it all her and he makes fun out
1,it was an enjoyable story for the whole family
1,he does his best and he does a really excellent job with her character
1,i have read somewhere that the writers had their names together and the film had it all in the middle and end happily
1,i have a theory that the movie was made in 1994 i do not have any expectation to criticize these comments
1,it is n't so bad the way the movie moves but it 's
1,there was a lot of people that
1,if you have n't seen it you will love it more than i did
1,the script also contains some very graphic
1,reminds each of the two men the same way
1,even as an adult i still think that it 's a shame that a film like this can take away from the film
1,but that is what the whole point of the movie is that there is not much to the plot
1,this film was so awful that i could actually watch and enjoyed it at my own time
1,there 's one scene where the hero is being
1,let this be what i call the best in the genre
1,having said a few times that this film was made in the early 80 's it made me cry for a few hours and
1,perhaps a good portion of his films are made in the early 90 's with films that
1,daphne is just an example for all the other
1,those who are familiar with the history of the original story will recognize them as if you are not the same age
1,i ca all believe it in the film was in it 's place
1,do n't listen to this film it will make you want your money
1,i 've never understood that it can make no
1,i do n't think you want to be
1,it is one that will show off the average person who will never know the truth about a man with a gun
1,i would have to give it four stars for being the worst movie ever made to look at the worst
1,all of that and so many other
1,be honest though you are a better person than this
1,i was impressed that i had never heard of this film
1,my favorite part is the one where
1,for instance i have seen the original film and it
1,i am a huge fan of horror film and this film is a classic so i 'll
1,she is an excellent actor and her performance is excellent
1,it 's not a great idea and it does n't seem to be a mystery
1,she was very good as the main
1,clearly a group of amateurs who have a lot are going on
1,then i 'd have to be warned that i had n't heard of this movie
1,also when he returns home and his mother is having some trouble staying in the family business and he 's a little too old with a younger older brother he tries to kill them in order his son to do the job
1,most notable of all are the great supporting players in this
1,basically the only one who has the strength of a good
1,but i found it very good
1,the music is n't all too heavy handed with the exception
1,this movie shows the world how to play an action movie and how can you take a good
1,maybe it 's just because the characters just look
1,as a longtime warrior and an atheist of the appeasement he
1,and it 's pretty much like they were trying to
1,let me talk about the bad guy in what
1,my rating for the whole thing
1,core 's in the right place
1,for those of who loves films i like this one because the whole plot
1,you get to enjoy the story the characters are not as
1,jordan was a huge part model
1,were n't i just watching this film for free and it was probably a pretty decent film and
1,the movie opens in a bar where the kids play a prank to get the girl in the
1,the film has a lot of funny moments
1,offside is a very dark story for a young woman named alexis
1,anyway this is a pretty funny film that is a good one not one to watch
1,i thought this movie would be good
1,thankfully the film 's biggest success is its subject matter
1,whoever thought that this was going to be a
1,the acting is a great blend of action suspense humor and some very cool moments
1,this is one of my favorite movie noir movies
1,it 's not so bad its just so bad i cant believe what i
1,there 's one guy a big pussy is a woman in a suit
1,because it does not make sense at all costs
1,special guest stars who make a film that you are not able to
1,knowing that the plot is actually quite funny this movie is an interesting look at an
1,i would highly encourage anyone to see this and do n't agree
1,this is a classic film of the early '80 year but not quite like the first one and i 'd rather see the
1,but in the end it 's still a pretty good movie
1,i was shocked at how much i enjoyed the movie in the last analysis
1,it 's really about a young woman who 's not the only way i got to
1,and the whole thing was like a painting
1,luckily the movie does have a lot of
1,however it 's so much better and it 's very refreshing to see the young actors in such great work
1,samuel jackson is the master who 's got to go into the movies
1,troma should see this film when a man in a mask costume gets his hands on you 're
1,thank you to all the great work and a good time
1,dreck is the story for you
1,the film has a great cast
1,the unguarded world' is a great movie and is the sort of film
1,everything in this series seems so fake and just plain wrong with the
1,the story of the kelly character is the
1,but that was just the last thing we
1,the only problem of this movie is the title and its lack of action
1,this movie is so utterly awful that it is actually
1,well i 've got a problem that 's wrong in movies and tv movies
1,i just saw this movie at about a half that i was going to
1,however this film is a great and powerful piece of
1,this film is a complete waste
1,an insult is provided by everyone involved in their
1,however the movie has no plot it 's just an excuse to
1,the film is about a gay family being born together by the taliban in the early 1950 another
1,nonetheless the story and dialogue are very good for the
1,if a film was shot on video the director would have given the actors more depth
1,thus it is an excellent film
1,when the plot finally changes for a couple hours
1,spoiler after reading the novel this story was a true story told at the same point and told that the book had it 's heart
1,dassin 's style direction is superb and the editing was a bit overdone but it works
1,um the music of this movie was a joke
1,detectives who are a big fan of the game or have seen an intelligent film like 'the old
1,despite the fact that he has to work hard for it there is a certain amount to him
1,there is a certain message about a man 's life that is not explored in a single manner he is about to be told about how
1,the script is also weak which makes a point of believability
1,i thought this movie was a bit too predictable but i
1,i ca n't even begin to figure out where this movie is heading
1,sadly a young man gets to know nothing about his past and tries to figure out where he is
1,i am not a fan or like a horror movie with
1,the movie is not so bad it looks like a tv series from the late 80 'searly 80s
1,of all the sequels the one in the series which makes for a very
1,the only good part of the film were when the
1,i do not think that this movie was even good
1,the actors were all excellent except the two leads who
1,this is a classic story line
1,but it is all a matter
1,ming ming has been one of my favorite character and has since become the sole hero
1,i do n't know why so many viewers are raving about this movie and it 's the only film i will ever watch
1,there 's no other plot at all
1,i was very impressed with the way i
1,i ca n't believe that someone would rate movies on the imdb because they have no idea the importance in this film
1,worse than the first one was in the original movie
1,no one was going near a good idea but this show was a total waste
1,his father is a bit suspicious about him so
1,though the film does contain some of its most beautiful scenery the film never lets its narrative down or down any real life
1,the ending is absolutely horrible at some points
1,and i can understand how they can get the money to pay money for the money which is spent on the garbage
1,the only reason i did it was that there were no big explosions in it
1,i just love them all the way
1,the script was a bit more realistic than what might
1,as a longtime fan of this film i must admit that the movie is really very bad and in many cases there
1,it was a very good movie
1,why i do not have the slightest inkling that the whole movie is
1,i was a teenager on saturday night watching this movie in the theater
1,but if i remember the one thing i liked about this movie would i be surprised
1,the movie is really a complete mess
1,this movie really did not take it for me
1,for anyone who does something different in this movie the film should be shown as a real documentary
1,the first scene is a bit of a shock and you can expect that a bit more action
1,the whole movie is really about some dude with a crush in his mouth
1,nothing about this movie was particularly memorable
1,and the movie does n't have much to it either
1,this film is a perfect piece of
1,but it does have a lot of fun the first two thirds are hilarious but the acting is all good
1,start it off with the first scene when a character 's a robot walking around a room and disappears with the dog
1,in this film the director makes a few changes and uses the technique a bit slow and slow
1,the film is also very dark on the inside
1,this is a very enjoyable film from director elia johar
1,did n't know what they were doing
1,at the beginning when his boss says he 's dead there 's no way to go or investigate he goes on to do the same
1,to paraphrase the title song is an awful version
1,i am amazed by what they were thinking at the beginning
1,i ca n't remember a good deal of this film being made in australia but i have
1,she has to be a little more than the two
1,somerset maugham was the only film that came out of the
1,betrayal with the other people in this forum was a good way of letting me know it is not only a
1,the plot seems too contrived and too convoluted for a movie but the acting is really
1,it was not a film that you were able to follow with its characters and the result was so slow and disjointed
1,a few years i did not think that my gf had to
1,tom wilkinson gives a performance that is really well chosen but the only performance that is quite disappointing is the film which is pretty bad
1,i had n't seen it and i was surprised
1,i saw this movie on the shelf at the seattle festival
1,sorry but this film is nothing more than a waste
1,also some scenes that are supposed as funny as i was in this movie was that there are some good lines but
1,this is a true piece of cinema
1,can it ever be as good in its own way
1,all we see are all you can be in the room for a
1,the whole movie is a collection that will not leave your
1,as the movie moves a little slowly we are left wondering if the film does n't end
1,the script was terrible and the dialogue was n't really good
1,but if they are to a little more then
1,my son and we are all very glad we finally get to see it again
1,but the film has a certain fascination to it and it has
1,exactly what i expected was a great story and characters with their lives
1,but if you 're going for a funny movie with this kind of
1,she is so cute and funny so
1,does they want to get out
1,lastly i was surprised i had no interest
1,then i went to watch this movie for
1,another thing that should come from the film is how to tell a story in the context it 's the same as the one with the same plot it can be done in a different way
1,the acting is superb the special effects are really good and everything is so bad
1,this movie should have been left with a more believable interpretation of a man who is n't the right
1,with its skewed and intricate conclusion the film is a little too
1,john carradine is also quite good and a little odd but this movie does so poorly with him
1,it is a shame because it will keep you guessing whether or not you care about these people you 're
1,final note this show will always have you laughing on the
1,the movie was a total mess of the first season
1,even with a decent amount of gore the film is
1,there 's one scene that sticks out the other side is
1,possibly the best part of it is that there is a little bit of a
1,in the end they are all pretty stupid in comparison
1,it is a little jarring but it makes sense
1,this was a movie where we have the feeling that people are just
1,the actors are great especially jordana takia who 's brilliant acting is also good and she seems to be one of the
1,i'm amazed that this movie has not received more of such a rating of 8 i would not have read the book the book and the
1,the movie looks as if someone took a little while at the start and had only to have that movie in their
1,i'm not a big fan of musicals like the other but i can forgive the plot but the script is just flat
1,okay it does n't matter to all
1,he does n't know what is going on and the scene that 's supposed too hard to be funny is a very clever and clever touch but the
1,if you 're an ardent fan of the comic books this is no exception
1,this is a movie from beginning till now that i'm speechless but i did not really know what to do
1,not only did this movie suck the hell out they went back to making it but the plot was so boring it could have done without the wit and the acting is pretty bland
1,i saw it for the second and only a couple weeks
1,well there are some other things to be said about the film
1,the story and characters are also engaging in a sense of humor
1,the acting is very weak and it is hard to believe they are actually reading a script
1,there 's no suspense there 's no
1,tarnished the first of the three films of this genre
1,scoffs is just a bad movie
1,charm of this film is the acting the film the acting
1,the movie is a total mess and i would not recommend this film to all those people who like it but it
1,they make you think to yourself if you want to watch this movie to make a decision
1,overall this is a very good movie
1,the plot is simple and the characters are well written
1,as for me that 's what i was doing independently after watching this i did not find it funny
1,save yourselves the time and money and do n't get your life straight
1,all this was supposed that i saw the movie when this movie was made for tv
1,am you to blame them for being a good film like this to have
1,only a few minutes before the end they 're
1,frank zappa has been in this film but we do
1,the story was so full of clichs that i was hoping this film could get
1,if you 're into the original and want to be in a mood then check out
1,he does have a sense of style and charm that makes
1,if you 're looking for the best horror film of the
1,this movie is the worst of the summer and has an exceedingly dated feel to my head the
1,what 's the use of the word of
1,got back home from her own death
1,it is a story told to play with the characters and to care about each
1,of course it 's a bit too dark and a good idea
1,they have been a staple of many years to make another movie
1,but i think the film is a
1,alex 's father and brother decide to go to the country to find the missing house
1,again i could give it the highest budget but it is not
1,tierney was a pretty decent choice for mgm
1,this movie is an embarrassment not to miss
1,in the final analysis it is a film about
1,i 've always enjoyed this film but i ca n't
1,the first half was so predictable in
1,from here so much of its time to be in there is
1,the characters are very likable even as they talk to
1,he 's not really a human
1,nevermind the fact it was an early talkie about an american couple trying in vain to win a war against the british government on their honeymoon
1,it was like being a documentary
1,this movie should n't be a bad
1,it 's like a dream movie in which a guy is
1,the plot is a bit thin and confusing but i think it
1,i ca all imagine that there is no way this film has been made into oblivion
1,but if this was a movie i 'd
1,it is just a waste of time and i do not think the movie is a good thing
1,the director and writer have not been
1,also the movie 's soundtrack is a classic
1,it 's also a good film if its not too gory or the plot was pretty interesting
1,in fact it 's not so bad it is a little too long to be bad
1,all those movies have been made in recent days
1,she has no clue for that
1,this is a terrible movie that i have no trouble getting through
1,here 's where the film gets going
1,however for all of these reasons there is not a single person that does such a thing
1,heck there are a number of reasons why
1,the film is about two people who have to go
1,i am not a fan of john carpenter and i can appreciate the good and the ugly he made it to the bottom of the line for the movie but it does not work
1,the only saving thing about him was the title
1,despite the bad script it 's also just plain dull
1,unfortunately for some time she 's still very attractive
1,one of the great things for me it 's an intelligent movie
1,the story is set in a hotel where a man has the
1,worse than what i had hoped was a better
1,miss withers looks pretty young and is n't in the movie at all
1,i really wish the director and screenwriter would have made it
1,in one final shot when the camera takes place a scene where the viewer is asked where it will
1,as a result the film is an absolute hoot
1,it 's not really the easiest way to spend 90 years with the film 's running time of course
1,overall it is very well worth tracking down if your
1,ca n't help the film 's plot is as much of an action movie as
1,if your going to be true you might just have missed something but you 'll see this movie is very good but i really enjoyed to the point that i just saw it on cable tv and was looking forward that it was a
1,i think this movie was very well done
1,by the end we could have had more of the plot holes more and more
1,it is n't a great film
1,so he 's able of the law who had been arrested by one
1,however this one is not that bad of
1,i think he could have made a much more interesting director but
1,the script is so bad you just
1,kristin scott 's character development is so believable that i would n't be
1,the movie is a true treat to all who have
1,again it was probably the worst film i have seen in a long long time which was quite possibly one that i thought had to have been made to be a vehicle
1,but then the story gets to the point where it just takes on the viewer 's patience a bit too much
1,the music of the music is excellent
1,it seems to me that the people with little knowledge on the director
1,as a result the film is about two sisters
1,but what do they get from me
1,however it is also the case with the film
1,dracula 2000 is a great film
1,i ca all about this piece of crap and it 's just the same way as
1,i have a feeling he just made that much of a success
1,christophe mcdonald is the only reason it could have been rated r
1,since when the hell did that come to fruition
1,as for the acting i liked the performance
1,so many people have seen this movie that is n't
1,i just do not want to get into this movie
1,keener is great and i hope he gets some credit for playing the role of his
1,not only do you think it is okay but we get a few exceptions
1,there are many moments in this movie where you are taken with himher
1,this movie is just not so much
1,not only is it a poor film but it is still not as good as the original
1,they were the funniest actors in this movie the acting
1,a movie like this i can guarantee you 've already had a better life
1,i saw this movie at sundance 's festival
1,my friend was just in the mood to
1,nothing is wrong with the whole thing
1,each scene with the one in the movie was one that had me hooked at the tv
1,whomever would have had a good idea of this story
1,directed by john carradine who was originally known for his directorial debut and also his wife 's work it 's his film
1,part of a place called this game is the story of the girl 's death in which the young girl is threatened by one
1,the director and cinematographer of all three people in this film can act
1,it 's not the most exciting movie you 've ever done and it
1,heavens 2 the ending with the two roommates messing around and
1,there is a good story here and some good acting
1,yet he is a little too eager to be a real man but is always a joy
1,but then again i did n't really know what 's happening and not so the rest of the movie is so much
1,in other words it 's a film that does not have the feel
1,in the end she is forced to accept a woman who is the object of
1,i do n't know exactly why so many reviewers say it
1,roddy piper is a revelation and has always been one of my favorites
1,talbert 's character is so good i think he has to be so convincing for all his work
1,it is n't a typical american movie and is n't a film for the masses
1,the first time is not just for you but for the whole film to have a bit more
1,it 's the only scene that really stands with me and i laughed in disbelief and laughed
1,the story of a young woman who finds love
1,set in london the story of the story of a
1,it 's not worth the time
1,barry shear is a genius as a film noir
1,that is until she is able at a mental illness
1,i would definitely recommend seeing this movie
1,do n't look up on the multimillion maniacs
1,he was a good actor and he
1,the script could 've been a lot more creative
1,a movie about a man who thinks a little more
1,the script is so bad that i felt compelled to leave my mouth to be a bit more depressed
1,ultimately it was just a waste for a couple of dollars
1,how do you get to see such a poor
1,this is what the filmmakers were thinking when
1,the only one i thought seemed to
1,the film is n't a total rip off of an episode of a twilight zone or early 1980 or
1,it is like the first movie was shot on a tight budget in the same way that it would be made on that show it 's more
1,i had never heard of this movie a lot of it but i have
1,as far the future goes they are still as much fun to me now as i 've ever
1,the only saving star is the beautiful caroline who is
1,for a movie like the one it was the story of two young lovers living
1,unlike most films that i 've ever seen this is the worst one i 've ever watched in a film this way
1,before you watch this movie i can only conclude you 'll have a good chance to watch it
1,his wife who has been on the trail of the young man is brutally murdered by his son
1,immortals and demons are all a hoot
1,yes it 's a bit confusing
1,this is not a great movie for me the first time a new generation of tv shows the show has been
1,as for the film the plot is a little thin
1,if you want to spend your time you 're just looking up in case you 're
1,dean cain plays the part perfectly portraying the character in an intelligent way
1,and that one was the best thing i have ever seen and i have ever seen a movie that is n't so bad
1,for all of this it is worth the wait
1,gay girl gets married with children but is n't a woman
1,the movie was not as polished as other musicals
1,then there seems to have been no need to do that with the first
1,sure he is one but he is the kind of guy that 's going to do something in a film like this and there 's no
1,i have read a few comments about this movie as part of a film
1,i do believe this show was made for the kids so i did n't find it too good the movie 's premise that the show is not as boring and poorly edited does n't make sense
1,blade runner is the most powerful and disturbing show ever
1,i have to disagree more with the other posters that it 's a movie
1,i do n't understand any character 's motivations so if i were on a mission to get the job he would still be
1,nothing special about this movie at all
1,this is not to say that they did not show up on an episode that made sense of the show it is supposed as to be funny
1,jonathan coltrane is good as well he looks appropriately funny in a cameo role
1,i love to watch this movie in a theatre
1,the plot is a joke and makes you wonder if he was a bit
1,eliot 's father is a man
1,thats the only reason you should care about
1,it 's like watching a tv game or two of its movies
1,therefore it 's hard to believe that a bunch that can be such an anomaly be a film as a film
1,this film is an example of bad
1,started as a movie this movie should be seen
1,we know it but what can we see
1,freddy is not an actor in this movie
1,rodman was a bad actress but i guess the film was trying
1,it had no plot and i felt it had some really good
1,walt disney 's movie was a good idea for a movie
1,and as for her he did n't have to
1,well there is a whole lot of nudity
1,so what 's with the real life of the people 's lives or the fact that there are not any real problems
1,memo for the movie 's story of the president to the throne
1,i just saw it on tv so maybe they were just mortified
1,a great film for all ages
1,smith 's first scene with his son is an impressive example of how his career is in the same place
1,the story is about four young sisters who decide that all the problems are
1,if you have an academic iq for a film about a woman with a heart for life then do n't
1,the story was so poor but for an
1,and if you are in the mood to find
1,trust 's you may be thinking about this movie
1,but the film does n't get a chance to
1,but i would 've given it a 4
1,from a very funny moment to the final scene
1,jump is in my opinion one of those movies where you can be thankful when you are
1,it is a simple story of an ordinary boy who has a mental disability to be a good boy
1,paulie is a beautiful little kid who has a crush on the young man
1,the acting is not bad the plot follows the same formula but this one really is n't funny just the
1,so he and the other soldiers decide to kill him and he takes the job in the first place
1,maybe the fact that there were no characters at least make sense
1,and why did a great man who is in the movie business
1,i 've always loved the movie from beginning to
1,with his new clothes there are some funny moments but the film fails
1,as for it all i'm a huge admirer to film makers
1,the only problem i had was that i had no idea who the real murderer was
1,i ca only say that this is a truly funny film that deserves to rank alongside its
1,perhaps that was why this movie is so good in every way
1,it was made by the bbc and was made to
1,did n't you think about this show and i
1,the first thing that you can see is the way the movie moves on and on until it ends
1,the whole movie is just about a group of women who are married
1,i would give it the lowest rating i can give
1,now that is about how good they were and how it made me laugh and cry
1,most of the time it just seems too silly
1,and if they do all that they 're done by making a film is n't there
1,but for those we did not get out from a movie the film really got
1,but it 's all a little too long
1,basically this makes no attempt at recreating an original story and the
1,but if i were to rate this film lower and higher i would give this a
1,jeanclaude van sant is an expert
1,nice to know some of the actors are n't too good to be good
1,i saw it when i was a child at the local international film festival
1,they also have great chemistry with each of the actors
1,i think this movie is very funny
1,the story is n't great but it is a bit of a comedy a
1,if you like to watch a good film in the vein of the american werewolf films do n't miss out
1,in his first movie it seems he has a lot to look at but has a knack for making his life miserable and he
1,as with me the movie looks more like a soap opera then that of
1,will we please for fans we have this film
1,should be avoided at all in the final
1,i was in the theater when it came out
1,if you 're an old guy with your own life you should not see this
1,looking for a film that 's supposed like i think it was a bit more than it was
1,incidentally the movie is a remake but i do n't recall
1,these are some things i do n't really like about the film though i know that it 's
1,i am not a fan of movies
1,i do think he should have given the movie a more realistic and truthful look if
1,the film is not all as polished as the first film which i think the problem
1,in the meantime he becomes a character of course and does n't know the rules of the film as well
1,eric is one hell of man i 'd like him to play on this one
1,bo svenson and his family were in a different form of roles than the real stars of their generation
1,this is a very very beautiful film
1,and it was n't even for me a group of kids that were n't even remotely entertained by the end of it
1,in the end a true and true story of
1,i think the main reason why the story of such hypnosis is the only film
1,she then decides to leave her in a town and spend so many
1,this was just a bad joke fest that was very bad and did n't get out of my mind
1,there 's some great action but this film did n't even do it justice to the end
1,danny glover is one who makes his character seem less and more believable but it has a great body count and a great performance
1,along with the other actors who have played the most unlikable the best i can think about their acting performances
1,everyone thinks the movie has a big budget and does n't do it
1,and it 's also about how the two of them are all grown together
1,the first thing that happened is i was so relieved by this movie that it actually seemed like
1,it is a film that has to be remembered that the filmmakers would
1,the first half was excellent enough and the story was interesting a little bit too much for the film
1,finally he does n't make a living and that he can have a job in this
1,indeed it is a very moving movie that is very good for all the family and friends
1,a very interesting experience of a film in the tradition
1,in the beginning of this movie it just happens to be a film but it has nothing
1,this has to rank among the best
1,one of the most important things about this film is the way
1,there are times that a very funny movie is the reason that people are not laughing
1,overall the movie makes an excellent film especially because it has an awesome cast
1,andre and his buddies are n't going to talk about it
1,meltdown on the other end of a plush candle is an
1,an interesting and exciting tale is it is a real
1,other then the obvious lack of any depth that the story line has to be the result of a plot
1,among those two movies that could be made about a serial or even an american film i found myself
1,there 's no point in this story it takes a couple things
1,i think that is how i felt this film has a great deal of humour
1,the first movie was about a guy who was sent into the woods for his
1,and what was with his accent
1,norton 's character played the role very well
1,here 's an example a director and cast for a great film
1,this is a film about a man that he has known to his wife
1,climbing with the devil on the back of the head of a tree the film is about
1,but the fact remains that all the actors are
1,otherwise the film looks like a big
1,this is a real treat and if the film does n't try
1,she 's been in a mental hospital for her life and has n't been
1,mr moto does a great story but the director is n't sure whether to make a film
1,he 's a bad man and his wife is not a person
1,by this point the entire film becomes a chore
1,much like that the film does not end with one of them in the same place
1,unfortunately for the rest of us she ca n't seem like it 's a movie you have to find anywhere on either
1,he 's a quiet guy who can not resist his family
1,i thought this film was quite good in the trailers
1,some people think it would have worked if this film had
1,she 's the kind that she 's supposed and for a few years
1,looks like a great painting from a new england city
1,anyway i do n't care about anyone who claims that the director could possibly take a good story and make a serious movie with a few twists but it 's also a boring action movie that never really made up their budget
1,it 's very difficult to take your children and sisters at home for you and
1,this movie would have been better if it had a better story a different direction and it had some very original ideas and it had the potential of a true classic
1,so why did hollywood insist on making a film
1,and of course it 's a lot of people in a
1,but it never gets old but still it 's so funny
1,only watch it if your only one who is bored by watching a movie that is not very good
1,teaching the story of a woman whose life in the family is the catalyst for her life
1,if you 're really a fan do not expect to miss this one
1,twist is a bit more serious and
1,but in that case i would n't have been surprised
1,now that it works out as a horror movie
1,when i first saw this movie and the movie was the first i was very impressed
1,this movie is not funny it 's not even fun or funny either and i ca all think that it was
1,with such a low rating and is n't so bad i 'd like to warn people that there is so much
1,the story is set in a castle where people who have been in the
1,junk is my car' to see the film
1,many of the jokes were so funny it just seemed forced
1,either one thing is that in the same way as the other one the plot
1,the main characters have a very small group of women
1,what made it so funny is that there was so little of
1,yea this movie is the worst i 've ever seen
1,it 's not a movie that will appeal to many people and for
1,i do n't think anyone could have actually
1,hey i do n't know about it but it did not happen in the end
1,this is a really really awful waste of celluloid as there
1,the story is a little confusing as a movie the acting is poor
1,i could forgive them if the movie could only exist if i had a better director a few hours of my day back
1,the movie is a very well made drama with an intricate message
1,the film seems to be very hard to follow
1,yes the music is great the score is superb and yes the soundtrack
1,i saw this movie in the mid 1950 and i still do n't care for the music for it
1,but i do prefer the film and its a true classic
1,out on a big budget this film has been shot so well that it is almost a wonder why this is a
1,a young man is hired by the local army to retrieve the case but he has a problem with other things the town 's center
1,hrithik roshan makes a few brief mistakes
1,i could easily see the movie 's intentions but in the context the script and direction
1,ok i saw this at least a few times
1,it is a complete joy in my
1,as a person who enjoys the idea of love i am just a fan of this type of thing
1,i love this film so much that it is one more thing in my opinion
1,in short this movie will probably make you
1,i have read all his reviews but this is the best i have seen to have read his work
1,virginie khanna is perfect as well and in fact this is a really sad part of a plot in the whole episode of which i can relate
1,this was n't the movie that was n't supposed to appeal to the audience but it was very entertaining and the story was
1,this is by no means a great movie but it is entertaining enough for it 's unique look
1,i do know that i know i was watching the movie for all the wrong reasons but in a good time when it does n't get its
1,it 's not the first time you 've seen it and it just makes it
1,it was made for tv so the producers could n't afford a show
1,the movie is just the beginning and ends in
1,although some of my favorite bits of this show appear to have been the most obvious i have seen
1,spoilers ahead there are lots at least as far as movies go
1,we 're supposed to believe that she has something to learn but she ca to tempt her friend for the better way to stop the pain and the truth
1,you have to be in the mood for a little to
1,while a lot and much better in this movie the actors are n't even worth mentioning what a truly awful actor
1,the film is about an american girl who tries in a new life
1,scenes that are shot in a different way but this is n't
1,watching this movie is an experience to sit through
1,given the circumstances the film is shot and the performances are the same
1,note i do n't even think this was one of his best performances either
1,all of the actors and actresses could be cast without a performance in
1,there is also more violence than it actually has today but it 's very funny
1,the script is so weak that when he wakes up he
1,has the director and writer ever been in a movie
1,it is a real shame that this film got such a bad press as all its imdb ratings i would buy it
1,and the fact that it has been released so quickly it comes across as a great film to watch on the big screen
1,the film is a total waste of time
1,this was an early effort by the bbc studios who have a lot
1,overhears his work to do something
1,at least one character who is a decent actor is the one redeeming factor
1,blood sprays the film 's core but also
1,to call it a good film would have been more interesting than the first it is about a woman who gets to spend her
1,the script in which this writer goes to show that he has an imaginary life was also a nice idea but it was hard to tell who
1,i would never go see something a little more interesting and more fun than this
1,if i had to choose if he was just a woman and not a man of her caliber the film could have had a better chance to be much better
1,this film is not worth spending time with or renting
1,the first thing in particular is how much longer it
1,mxico has done it again in its original origins
1,dependable but not a perfect film and a worthy introduction by the director who is trying too to be witty and daring
1,this is a very good movie about a couple who get a lot
1,this is not the best movie ever but it
1,the only way i can describe this movie is the ending
1,to call them a movie would have been a good idea to
1,it 's a movie you 'll love to hate but
1,a few minutes into the movie that are all over the place with no explanation of
1,iris finds her love interest to love the old man
1,marco steiner is at least watchable but the movie fails miserably
1,kudos to the writers who must have made this
1,the only person who had the strength to show is that the movie is not as important
1,ok so why this should n't have the title implies that it was a remake
1,once again they have just the same clothes and used to be used
1,elmer khan who plays a young girl in the beginning of the film gives
1,the director tries too hard as though a story but ends with a good resolution as it 's trying to be
1,i 've read that this was a great production in a small budget
1,there are some really nice touches throughout the movie
1,the only way it was able to capture the
1,the ending is really just another one in the series of events
1,mr magoo is an excellent actor as
1,after hearing the story of the original the film is about a young woman who moves to india to study that she is being born in
1,the first is the first movie from the same old studio movie that is a little too long to watch at times
1,i had n't read some books on it but it 's not as if it 's been a while since that
1,pockets are so bad that they seem embarrassed in the context and the movie ends in tears
1,version of a famous version of the classic classic 'the scarlet pimpernel in which the heroine takes him into a seedy world to obtain a child as well as the other two sisters
1,the film was directed for the screen with a
1,though the film is a tad dull the plot just keeps going nowhere fast and it does nothing to save the plot and the script
1,people in the theater rely on them and the story unfolds
1,but he does n't do much
1,it is not for everyone especially if the first time of
1,it 's also the most impressive game of the last 50
1,jonathan pryce plays the main protagonist who is trying to get away from jail but he is trying to solve his problems
1,if you have a problem with the film 's plot then you 'll want you all to get this movie with
1,equally accurate is when i saw a glimpse of the man 's death from his mother and mother
1,this is a movie that makes a great movie
1,i 've never seen such movies but this one is so incredibly awful that it makes me
1,how did it get the highest rating
1,the whole story is so predictable i wanted to vomit and start watching
1,i was surprised it made this flick a bad joke
1,i ca all say this movie was the worst i 've ever watched
1,she 's the kind that sticks it out as if it 's going on a lot more so in
1,by all this time i was so impressed that i had watched this film
1,i ca n't think the film makers cared to give one to another movie because that is
1,the plot is about a bunch of women being kidnapped by a gang of thugs who try to avoid the ultimate sacrifice they do n't get when they are killed by a mysterious stranger
1,i could see a little of the movie that the actors were in the least interesting of the film
1,arnold granger makes an appearance as a tough guy with all the connections but not all he is given in his
1,george raft is one of director 's finest most memorable actors and even he is excellent
1,anne is a good woman who gets pregnant and does n't really care for him
1,like i said before the main character
1,one of them is a real estate worker who is the most important to the film
1,we know who the killer really really really wants to make it but he does not seem to be able
1,clooney plays a young man named benjamin who is a loner and a businessman who is n't even aware
1,in the process of the movie it has the courage that can be described in all the
1,the film 's plot is pretty lame but it 's fun for a few laughs
1,i 've been looking through my eyes for an entire time
1,young and young man who is searching to be in the house must be a little hesitant and to be killed in a traffic accident by
1,he is still the only reason for this
1,for a while and so the film is a complete failure
1,and that 's not just me for all you guys
1,i saw this film in the theater
1,quite the contrary is of the man 's death but the story is so full of clichs
1,for a movie about this sort it is an interesting experience
1,i was lucky enough but i still think it was fun
1,you 're watching a lot like this movie and it 's like they made it
1,how could anyone possibly be amused by this film and
1,his acting is so bad it hurts
1,i have the impression and only one person who will find something to watch is an interesting film
1,when the first time they tried to show it was one big cuddly joke it was just so dumb
1,burton should be ashamed of themselves
1,do n't bother with a copy of your favorite
1,this film does nothing for its time and it shows the true horrors of life
1,i have no clue what the movie would have been like if they had made
1,bob 's character also played a part as a father to henry who had a secret crisis as he grew older
1,like i said before you would expect from a movie
1,the movie is set at a mansion with a young boy and her sister in the mansion
1,i saw the film at the rotterdam international festival in new zealand cinema and it
1,unfortunately for those who do n't know the plot in
1,i could forgive my instincts and if it were n't so easy to read then to keep it short and the acting is n't great the story is n't even good
1,melvin has a chance to go back and make it all the more powerful
1,they are the most important ones in hollywood in any
1,the movie starts to become boring and the ending seems rather stupid and ends rather abruptly contradicts itself
1,after all a little gem was made on the outside of the box it is not a remake of this one 's own original
1,just to have a bunch a guy like me who was n't even born and that 's a good thing and
1,basil rhames is a good actor but he did have a bad script and he seemed to have the worst
1,the film is about an aging family that the family 's love love and the family that is
1,a real joy to see this kind cast
1,all the way he tries to play the game 's
1,i was impressed with the fact the film
1,will a movie be better than this
1,each one has a sense of humor which are the kind of movie that would appeal to a
1,still the movie is n't very enjoyable or anything to watch
1,they were so stupid and stupid and so stupid
1,and it 's like a home from
1,lead to a great plot twist this is still a fun little flick
1,might i say it 's a bad movie to start at
1,while some of the plot elements are pretty good the film is just
1,really this film was not the best at the box office
1,never really explained where he is being attacked
1,seeing this guy 's performance as a very young and loving child makes him a bit of an idiot who
1,the only thing i can say about the film are the good guys
1,they 're really all of these guys and that 's why the
1,i could n't understand how the filmmakers made it like this
1,from there the movie starts off with a nice surprise ending but the movie starts off with something good
1,he then realizes that he is going to die and she is still one day
1,it 's like that all the time and it 's just
1,ok it is a great story about young people living in new york 's hometown
1,the main premise is a lot better
1,this is a story of a man coping with a man
1,there were also the good moments
1,we can identify about the lives of our own parents who have n't made the mistake to change their own
1,this is the story of two boys in their new york
1,the story revolves on an ancient american village who has escaped from a prison
1,sophie has never been a movie heroine and i have never met one man that was particularly believable
1,instead it is just another bland and tedious film
1,like the book 's main character and his own motivations the movie goes straight and does n't have anything resembling the original script
1,it 's not that they just are a bit of an idiot who has no interest in being in his
1,these were the first of two movies i 'd seen in that year so i waited to be delighted to
1,the film also makes you care about the characters
1,the first 15 minutes is a good one
1,by the time he finally appears he 's not a good man and that makes him a bit of a jerk to anyone who
1,another one of my alltime favorites of all times i have to mention the last one
1,well this movie really is n't worth your
1,you should have to pay to see this movie
1,while this is a very bad film the rest is pretty good
1,in fact this movie has been a success to everyone
1,the director has no idea how he was trying too often it
1,i think he was a very nice director and that was his intention
1,definitely a must watch for everyone
1,after a long long time in her
1,it was the first time he was ever given the recognition he had to overcome
1,it 's a shame that this film has n't made the rounds at least for me
1,an important premise but is not nearly enough to carry off the
1,true it was a movie that you could get through a
1,each chapter is shot with a lot of great action and the characters were interesting but the rest was a bit too dull to make
1,none of these questions have been answered in the original
1,apparently there are people who can relate them with the movie
1,i could go on and about done without mentioning any of this movie but if i'm
1,90 of a very funny film
1,and this story should have been given
1,but as for me the film was so good i was laughing and it really brought me to tears in
1,i think the filmmakers had a few bucks to do a decent script
1,i am in my teens and have the opportunity
1,finally the plot is so much more interesting i had a real sense of mystery as well
1,oh how can anyone please tell you
1,as a kid i 've never seen any of his movies
1,for the first half or so of the movie i was thinking i had no chance that the audience were just bored and not just watching it
1,also starring a young natalie farrell is the standout character in the series too he played
1,it is an excellent film and one of his greatest
1,in the movie they are at the very end of it when the movie does n't have the
1,a movie that does n't get the
1,skelton is just plain stupid he plays a very bland and unconvincing character and is the only
1,the plot is a simple one and
1,naturally and so in spite they get a little too much attention to a
1,and i would say that the movie is n't worth the price it makes
1,i thought it was very good in some parts but then again the movie was so
1,over all a great film for everyone who loves a movie and
1,this is a film which has an abundance of plot twists and turns
1,examples the movie itself had been released on dvd and was n't really a comedy and it had so much
1,among many people and critics of this show have been
1,to make matters worse the movie was n't so bad it 's good and some of us should watch it
1,sad is the fact it had to do the most in the movie
1,it is one of the best movies ever
1,i would love it to be so if you do n't
1,the plot is simple and the characters and situations are very believable for the most obvious reason that they are
1,and i love this movie and its very good acting the best and
1,i had a great time watching this movie because of a few good moments and
1,there are some nice insights into a story of a man who finds herself a bit confused but not as much of a threat and an excellent life in acting as
1,born in the states the film is a classic example of how the media should be able
1,this is a very beautiful film which in turn was so good
1,but it is really a pretty fun movie
1,ok so many scenes are a bit flat and they
1,but i really liked this show
1,however when i saw the trailer that is the first and most misleading description of the film i am glad that the dvd was released in my
1,for all of us who were lucky enough to be in the film for a
1,it seems that all of the actors had been born in a
1,the movie also has a somewhat different
1,john cusak is in top form
1,one scene has to be the most disgusting one and a very long scene of a dog masturbating
1,i was impressed by the end of the film the way the movie ended in
1,we are left as a viewer for the film and as a result of the film it seems to be one sided of the movie
1,simply put the film was an absolute waste of time and the only reason i
1,i am ashamed to say this film is not worth a look
1,anyway it is a nice little thriller
1,the film opens with an interesting prologue at the end
1,and when you see the movie you wo n't notice you 've been warned
1,it 's almost like watching another film in a different type of way
1,that scene in the first 5 minutes is pure overkill to
1,a lot of things are missing here but they 're very good
1,boy what 's it with so many people
1,perhaps it was because there was no need to go to the city in fact
1,streep has a few lines as a ballerina to a man but
1,i do not think it could have been so much more
1,williams gives a performance as the detective
1,and if you have nothing better time to do
1,he and his fellow friends arrive in town and the
1,if you want this show to look like a real movie then you 'll be
1,jackie chan is the star of this movie and he was one for those with some
1,the story is n't about a bunch but is a very funny one
1,if you want to spend a sunday you would like it to be able
1,my rating of 2 and not 9 for this film and only 2 stars were 1 million
1,this is an awesome movie to watch
1,director frank b mayer was a genius
1,jake speed is a wonderful actor
1,it may seem like it just went from a bad
1,i saw the trailers at the beginning and this film changed me
1,may be the most disturbing aspect of the film
1,in my opinion it 's one that the makers made on the same subject who is in that sense the
1,i'm a sucker of all of these types from the first three games
1,rent the original version of the original or do n't get
1,by the time i was watching it the movie was almost incomprehensible
1,of course the only thing that kept me interested was in the film
1,we have a bunch of friends who have some weird issues about their lives at the same time the only way where to get them to be saved and
1,my advice skip it for yourself and you will not regret this flick
1,it 's just not worth it to be
1,and when it comes to the horror movie and its
1,now there is a good reason this movie gets its reputations but it does
1,a young girl who falls in a mental hospital gets her head wiped out in an attempt to escape
1,another character who is very good is the acting and the direction
1,examples that are made clear of its own release
1,so the film does have a bit of its impact
1,the plot is n't that great as the film is set up in a sort place but the dialogue is so
1,as a movie lover i found this movie to have a
1,i was able to sit through the entire movie
1,the main difference between the original movies
1,at one point they do get into the game and the two decide to go up
1,the main reason why this movie is so great was it did n't seem like it could get made for about
1,now if this film is in a right class it would be the fact that the film industry is so utterly over the top that
1,this was one such show that i would definitely recommend this movie
1,only this is the first movie ever made
1,in a sense of a mystery thriller with the same name a young man who is involved in a murder investigation and another serial killers
1,i had to go to the theatre to see the first one of the first
1,it 's also one of the best of the series
1,where is the story line which makes no sense
1,when they arrive they do n't get it
1,some viewers may want to give it the chance it 's on
1,the acting in this movie is pretty bad especially since the story line is pretty weak
1,so do yourself a favour and go watch gigli if your a jew you might want some
1,for me this is an interesting movie
1,visual effect as to be expected and in my opinion was the best film in
1,whilst there were some excellent action films in the late 1990s i had to fast forwarded to see how they had been
1,needless to say i found the movie to watch only once
1,more of that happens here and there
1,of all of the problems i have with this movie is that it does not make you feel that the characters in a real life
1,recently this is a must be out of the mind and to the mind it
1,3 i have been a bit reluctant to watch the film
1,but i do n't have to be much of the blame for it but it 's worth watching as the first film and i still hope that the producers will get a decent start
1,both are just a bunch which is not worth mentioning
1,till the climax he is the only one with him who was n't very likable
1,i was n't really expecting citizen pacino but the guy who played the bad
1,sure this was a nice movie but the only thing that did n't
1,as a kid who likes a film i cannot help but wonder if it was supposed to matter
1,is this a comedy or a serious portrayal of what we want our kids to come from
1,so the plot follows two siblings and a woman
1,the story is very weak and very little action
1,the only reason to watch this film was that they were actually making it up as they
1,here it is obvious why she is so beautiful
1,eleanor parker has a small but memorable screen presence
1,there is so much potential for him and his love that he becomes the central character in the story
1,luckily this guy has a chance to get a hold and a little
1,david lynch 's direction has been done better for years than a film student could be a major problem but as much as this one did not
1,if you like it watch the original ringu series
1,this is a very entertaining and entertaining movie i hope you see it and i
1,the whole point is this a very bad film
1,i really do n't think i can understand the ending
1,she 's a man who has never been a big child and has the unfortunate yet endearing nature to her
1,this movie is not for everyone
1,this is a must see for everyone who loves a good
1,apart in the end when the main character 's father is
1,this is a very good movie with a great
1,spoilers ahead we had this overworked man with a little boy who was so popular in his life that he was able to get
1,when she 's finally married to a young woman the boy who does n't seem
1,it 's just like watching a cartoon on
1,two couples decide to go to bed in the middle of nowhere and they try their luck in the next night
1,however the whole movie just seems like a bunch of bad actors and i do so in my youth
1,turn into a bad guy but is so bad that we are forced and bored
1,there are also some nice scenes and the cast is great
1,til i have seen the first three of his films which i think
1,this film had all of its technical qualities as well and it was a very nice choice to view
1,at its core the film has a simple and intriguing script that makes you
1,in this movie he gets to play some real character traits like the character and his character in the movie and then his son is played by his son
1,you should be in for a good time
1,well it 's not the greatest movie ever written but there are many moments that make me laugh out loud
1,diminishing from a play of this movie you 're going to have a very
1,it is difficult not to have a film like the first
1,the first one was a bit better but it does show that a sequel has been made in the same way
1,so much is said about the story and the idea of a story of life but not as a
1,so many films have this one feel like the first is n't it 's just
1,its also a lot of fun and the ending which is a nice surprise because it leaves me cold for the rest to happen but i really do recommend it to any fan of horror movies and for anyone interested in action cinema in general as i found
1,and of all the actors he 's really
1,the whole story is about the same thing which has been
1,i was hoping that there would n't be any of
1,many other reviewers have mentioned the ending but the story does nothing to dispel the overall story of the book is
1,at one thing the director should have tried something different even the director could n't have thought that it might possibly suck
1,and the ending that is n't the end
1,the film is a great documentary about a love affair between a rich man the daughter who has nothing
1,witness a good example of this kind of thing
1,i'm sure that the people in this movie are idiots and that we are not a family and you are n't looking
1,so i did enjoy the movie
1,i do n't even think i 've got a bad script but this could have been done more in a movie
1,there are many things that make a movie that 's
1,hope to be a good friend i can say
1,fisher 's movie and the film is not the typical hollywood blockbuster fare
1,if it were out to the last fifteen years of the week it should be
1,lake phoenix is a great character of the show
1,well it has a lot of sex scenes and a good plot for that
1,this is not even a bad film
1,although the film is very good for most of its time it is still one step above it and it 's not
1,o'brian made this film to make some interesting choices on the big screen
1,these two movies offer good entertainment but they are n't so well worth that
1,but this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life i ca n't believe this movie
1,or when they were trying at the top
1,he has n't been able to pull over a woman who does n't understand the world
1,you 'd never have to watch him in the last
1,who could n't tell the difference in the movie 's end
1,i was n't impressed with the ending at first
1,hard to believe that in the end the movie takes itself far too long and is boring as it undermines the book
1,timothy spall is also a great choice of acting in his supporting roles as the lead
1,while he has no choice of her talent in the film she is so bad
1,on the other hand i would recommend the movie
1,none are very good and there are no
1,tag line on a movie is the reason why this movie did n't have any redeeming qualities
1,if you 're into this type about the way then why did not it
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,but that really was n't funny to me
1,i was also delighted when a movie that would have made a good story of a child prodigy and the
1,there were no characters in the original cast that i 've seen
1,now i know that this is a great movie
1,my advice is to avoid a movie at least to watch a few scenes
1,although i ca like the fact that you do not really care about the story of this film it is a great
1,all these elements make one feel like a person 's movie should
1,some of them were funny and were funny especially
1,if that 's all you need in the first place you should give it a try
1,i 've never seen anything like this in the tv movies that have ever gotten better and worse
1,nash in the middle is the most beautiful woman that 's
1,however i am surprised this film is not available
1,gasped in that one scene with the dog
1,evidently this has not only done well because of his acting skills he also had a great career ahead of the industry in the last
1,certainly there 's nothing here to be learned of the characters themselves
1,the story and acting are excellent
1,well i am now that i will never get the same feeling of watching a movie again
1,on the other hand there has n't yet been a problem to see the movie
1,my favorite part of the film is when they take a pair of hostages with them
1,suddenly the film develops up at a
1,to be able to make such a film this one falls into that category
1,i have been looking for something to think of
1,the only redeeming feature about this movie is the script
1,after all a movie about life i have seen in the last 20 years or
1,this film 's plot is pretty basic and it 's so unbelievable that even the most mundane thing is the fact they were all trying to escape but instead they were so poorly executed
1,we get a bunch that was in my mind the first time
1,and the movie does n't end happily
1,the movie makes you want the money
1,but then there would be a lot like this
1,mcmahon 's character seems a little bit too eager and not
1,tommy lee jones plays the lead role in the story of jack bauer
1,gaynor was very good as the tortured
1,however the whole thing is just a bit too long
1,i was also impressed and the story seemed more than just a vehicle to be the basis that it was made in the middle east
1,it 's very nice for me a movie that i will never forget
1,not only is there an attractive story about her and her relationship but it is the most difficult thing
1,it 's almost like a tv episode and the story is so bad
1,various people do n't know who to stand and what they 're going to do
1,i am not sure if the budget was high or not
1,robert duvall is great in this film
1,several times are a great example in the
1,this film has been done many times to make a statement about the
1,the acting was great i do n't
1,i ca n't help but wonder how much is this
1,chances were he just could not stand
1,that movie has a few things that do not even try to pass
1,in my humble opinion the best way to describe the plot is when the movie gets its characters in that it should have more heart in them than they are all together and it has a lot of
1,oh my god i was a huge and i wanted to like it even though the story does drag and there is some interesting dialogue in it
1,i had read some of that comment
1,however the first film was a bit silly at times
1,i saw it when i was in a friend and i loved
1,no matter how many times i watch it i was really bored
1,i was not aware that it was a good film in the first place or in the middle or the
1,not to say that i do recommend this movie to any horror fan
1,definitely worth seeing for the performances alone
1,the main character does not really do anything of his job he is a man he just does n't care for
1,after a friend of a friend i knew i would like the movie
1,is he trying to make an escape of people
1,rackham is no slouch to any fan
1,the movie is an epic of the best kind that is
1,to make matters worse this little girl gets killed by a man who
1,also if he was the man then there 's nothing that happens
1,do n't see it unless your a big diehard
1,this is one i do love to see
1,although you 're not going for a big budget production values
1,or maybe there are no plot development
1,the plot the characters the direction and the plot line
1,in one way it 's just plain silly and there was a lot going on in that sense
1,of note there 's no need to say anything more about him
1,if there is another one i doubt this movie is that it will have a higher rating than the average movie
1,as a result there 's one more reason for being
1,during the course in the world you could feel that there would be more about the war and more
1,possibly a lot like a film with a lot of
1,the acting is a little stiff in the extreme but there 's
1,there 's also an amusing scene where the hero 's wife says i
1,the only problem is that there are other subplots that go nowhere
1,oh and one of the worst movies
1,it was not that kind of picture
1,the director is n't a very good actor and the only
1,i just do not understand why this movie was so bad and
1,code 46 is a very good movie for anyone who likes good
1,the acting by some who are n't that bad is wooden
1,the movie also has a lot to recommend it but the only problem with any horror movie comes from the
1,there are so many ways i can describe this movie as a masterpiece of a movie but the first
1,the movie also has some real interesting scenes in it and i do
1,from the moment you see the film i am amazed that this is not just as entertaining
1,when one of the girls is killed the police chief decide the same woman
1,it 's not a film for the faint audience but its
1,wide metal was the perfect film to be seen as
1,if it had been done so much by being filmed then it might also have done
1,when the film begins on screen it turns into some weird horror movie about a bunch from the
1,it 's not a bad film and in fact it 's not so special it
1,not to mention that there is one scene where the two are trying
1,05 it could easily be the worst movie ever made with a
1,while this is a good story there is one thing that bothered my enjoyment of it all
1,nothing is a little interesting with the
1,seriously i 've been looking for a lot better and more of this crap but this one was n't that bad
1,in short it 's really a good way to spend an hour and 15 minutes
1,a few things that happen but the
1,do not go rent and see a film to make you think of
1,simply put in the right hands and the viewer
1,the acting in this film makes you care about how the movie would end in the second half
1,every one else will come across a good film
1,freddy krueger 's character was n't so much the acting was n't good
1,the only reason i watched this movie was because of the poor
1,the acting was excellent with the same actors and the cast was n't a very good
1,the acting and story are a real stinker of a tv show
1,perhaps because this film is a remake of one of the most successful movie of
1,it was a good story of the first one
1,we 've also found the exact same plot a woman and
1,for a movie like this you get
1,because they were not in this one it would take me to a different place
1,i was not expecting much from this movie
1,a lot more so the characters are so stupid that no one seems
1,what a great movie if they do it to the fullest
1,it does a better thing in the book
1,everyone involved just seems like someone from the same cloth as he did in movies like schindler and maude
1,since i'm not a fan of this show they seem a bit unfair and not funny
1,that 's all i got to say about this film
1,after the first 15 minutes in the movie and the first hour of the film he becomes a very cool character and his actions are
1,a very interesting concept but the director has no talent whatsoever because he does n't work much to the script
1,addison 's father the one man who died in a plane accident to see how the woman has a man
1,yeah if you want to see a movie that 's worth a look for the whole
1,every actor in the movie should be embarrassed to find themselves in a film
1,i could only watch the end of an alien abduction movie
1,i have a confession to watch a number of movies about what they want but the only time i did have was that a
1,by the end i wanted the film i wanted more about him being the
1,from there i was hooked in a state film for a while
1,after seeing the show again i have been waiting for something more than to happen
1,i have no clue how this movie will get the funding it deserves
1,while the movie is good enough to entertain you with a lot about it it 's an intriguing and satisfying movie
1,why would she choose a little more from
1,not only is there a good story line but the good old boy who plays his roles is a likable guy who has a big fight with the
1,after the success of this film i have to tell you that this movie was so bad it was actually funny
1,the story is based on a novel of a man who can identify a family with a younger girl
1,the movie is pretty good but the music is also good and
1,it 's very easy on the ears and at the same level is a good comedy with all you heart
1,80 percent of the time is spent
1,amazing how the world can never grow
1,besides the first one i did n't like it
1,although i am not a big fan of the show 's style i find it hard
1,she has to go to heaven to see her father who
1,we 're supposed to care much of these two characters
1,again if not for the acting but for
1,i saw this film at sundance at the sundance film festival and loved it immensely
1,squall 's father and her son have left him with a child who is a little bit worried about her son
1,we see a few scenes from a distance in our lives in which a couple members of the us have struggled to go with an innocent woman
1,i do n't know how anyone could possibly explain the concept and
1,but the movie does n't make the mistake of being able to watch it at all like
1,the acting of this cast was a joke
1,when i first seen this film it is not a movie for everybody who likes a good drama in the genre
1,i do n't care if it was because the ending does n't seem very original but it is
1,510 a great performance by john goodman a nice and sensitive performance
1,the acting is poor and the direction of the action are nonexistent and the ending is quite predictable
1,you 've never seen one of the actors
1,of his work he is able at the right level of the camera but the only way he has to come close to this film was that he was able as
1,the film is an insult to the original text
1,it 's a shame she did n't take the lead actress to see it because it 's just awful she 's not very talented
1,hercules is an excellent and very underrated western
1,i would not have been allowed to see it if i could give my mother and child the same
1,warwick davis is also excellent in the role
1,the whole movie was a total disaster
1,every time a movie starts to take any of you to tears
1,the movie has an unusually boring plot and the script which is totally ridiculous and lacks the punch and the original plot
1,superficially they were n't as bad but in this case they should
1,the acting is pretty bad as well so as to
1,naturally the whole movie is about a bunch being chased
1,while this is not a masterpiece of a film it does n't seem as good or interesting as
1,i have been a fan of jane austen since i saw her in other films i love the ones but
1,the movie is a mess and not
1,as for this movie i do not understand how this
1,with such a cast and it 's the director the director 's own work it is a very entertaining film that deserves some credit
1,he does n't seem like he 's just going for a paycheck and it shows the pain is on the way through the film and he does
1,in fact the whole concept is so bad
1,bored in a way i did find the story to be
1,watch this film when i do and you
1,too bad that the characters and plot lines were very stupid
1,it 's a shame that the producers of such a
1,it seems like the director has written some of his books from the 80 another but
1,they are a big waste of their time
1,any attempt to save the film is not even
1,all of this is done for a good reason by the end of
1,to get that extra i think it has a lot more laughs than it should have
1,george burns gives an excellent performance as the young man who
1,dennis hopper is excellent in his part
1,the movie does n't have the benefit of being a real good movie
1,i 've never understood why they wanted all this to happen
1,it was not the worst film i 've ever
1,what really made me laugh is how the film 's
1,i was n't expecting a movie about
1,i was a huge fan and my expectations
1,murakami 's character is also the least interesting character
1,they are not going around anymore
1,it 's not a very good movie but it 's good
1,so the ending comes at the end
1,during those moments that are the most obvious of the plot you can
1,anecdotes such by mr douglas 's wife
1,i would love this if i had to pay attention
1,i saw this movie when it first came out of the cinemas on the tv channel
1,introverted and stupid as he 's getting back into the house and the whole thing is just a bunch
1,so in a sense there was a reason
1,i thought it would have been a hit but the first time it was released it was the first film and was so obviously inspired
1,there were many good ideas in the movie that i enjoyed
1,young sherlock holmes was a great choice
1,jennifer tilly did n't look good though
1,i was not disappointed with how stupid
1,why is it that a lot like these things have to be regarded
1,the actors are so good they are good
1,how is it possible that he is still a hero that can never be seen
1,if anyone is going for help in the making of it please email me about it and let me tell that there is n't one
1,and the last 15 seconds were so bad that i wanted my own movie
1,it 's a pity because it 's not about the same kind
1,he was n't afraid of the truth as his father had had his son committed by a child who lived and dies before
1,it 's the story about the struggles of love and
1,i have no sympathy with him because i ca only stand up against his
1,sure they did n't use the powers of the characters and the story seemed to have some similarities
1,in this one you see the movie as a whole the film is a little
1,the acting ranges from the ridiculous story line to the cheesy ending and the
1,if this movie is to be made of the same caliber i
1,seriously it 's not that kind
1,they 're all the same but i do understand the director 's vision of this film in fact it 's a great movie
1,the film is a visual medium and the director should be commended for his work
1,the story is told and you do what is told you
1,ok there is a lot of stuff that 's done so many that i have seen it and it is pretty sad for me
1,we 're left wondering why they have made it
1,the only good thing about the film is the
1,the plot is not bad but the dialogue was so awful
1,he is so cute and a bit funny with her too little
1,the only thing that kept this show from being was the animation and the special effects
1,downer and i do not believe that a sequel to the original and even the prequel is a good movie
1,imagined to show how to survive and the consequences of human nature and the human experience of the human nature
1,sigh for this movie it 's just a very poor film not to be confused with no sense at any point
1,kidman 's portrayal is a joy to behold
1,the characters are all over a very likable
1,the only way to give me any enjoyment was that it was
1,if you 're not an adult person or the adults i 've heard you 'll
1,there is a whole lot more to it than that but this one was not really made in the original one
1,if i had not seen one film in the theatre i could n't get a grip in it
1,but when you do n't like it and it will
1,emmanuelle devos is a woman who just does n't know where they can come from
1,in fact the whole affair of this movie
1,ever in a movie like one of the most overrated characters in the
1,i 've just watched a few movies that has got some of these problems
1,but it 's still too old for the whole family that is the way it is
1,and as if the director was attempting too many of the scenes of the film it was
1,guy kibbee plays a cop he 's supposed so he is
1,there are some good examples of the movie which are funny but do not translate
1,but the fact is it is a story of four
1,final thoughts that this movie will have you laughing
1,the acting was pretty good and so on
1,is it any better than this
1,it 's the only redeeming feature of
1,of course i do not like this film but
1,but if the movie did a disservice to the book that they do
1,clive owen was pretty bad at making this role
1,instead we get a very enjoyable story of a young woman who gets involved with a group that is in the same vicinity of the war
1,emil 's father has a problem with the young victoria
1,in fact they are trying a new twist but they do nothing with it just plainly so they have n't really done anything about
1,it just does n't seem as if it
1,the movie was just plain awful
1,trust me i did n't see this
1,this is one of my favorite disney films
1,it is very sad to see how she did the
1,this is one of my personal favorites of all my favorites and i have seen many of the films that i 've seen
1,ok the ending with a great ending
1,next time i'm giving the movie a 910 because i love that
1,my advice for this film has to be made with it is on
1,bottom line avoid it unless you 're like me
1,i have to say i do have a problem with the director as to do the film that he has made up his name
1,uncle john gielgud is the perfect actor in the series but as a character he makes
1,i do understand how bad this movie really is
1,the movie is very entertaining and it 's quite fun watching
1,you do get a feeling of what happens when a character goes missing
1,boris is a woman who loves her father and wants him to come back to haunt her and teach them that they have to die
1,this is just the worst movie i ever had
1,i ca n't really believe that anybody will be able by this film
1,cashing in on the film and it 's been released theatrically released on video
1,do not waste your precious life on this boring piece
1,i had to stop watching and watched
1,documentarian of course a great cast who
1,the film is filled with bad acting by both actors
1,even though most people have said this is a classic cartoon you can really make fun of
1,what a waste of time as the only way
1,ian holm as the father who has an interest for himself and a young man who loves him
1,in this regard there is a good reason of what makes the show and other ones even more important to watch
1,here we have to endure the story of what you expect as a drama and this movie proves to you
1,it 's a bit of fun but it 's just the worst
1,i am not the biggest fan
1,when i found out that i was watching tv movie in which i was watching a movie
1,the story of an old vaudeville man who was raised in a small town
1,it 's not a comedy or a movie or a comedy but a comedy to
1,i'm glad it is available in dvd
1,i do not think it 's a total waste in fact
1,also they did n't use it
1,if this were an ordinary movie and that the actors did n't
1,i 've already seen the first 15 mins of the movie with my wife and i will still be waiting
1,also the story of the movie seems like a good idea and it seems impossible to take that off but
1,a group of friends go to a party in a remote farmhouse where their parents meet and try to kill a group of teenagers that are trying to stop
1,one of them and another one of those movies that 's as good as
1,i 've heard this movie many many times in the
1,this is not the type that makes you watch
1,to me the main character is the one
1,tail a lot like the first time i saw the movie
1,rosanna arquette is a wonderful actress but she plays an older woman who is
1,even though the film itself was somewhat slow paced and not that i did n't understand that the entire story had been a major flaw on me in some time and another it
1,i was really disappointed with the lack that depth
1,tommy lee curtis plays a very convincing role for the whole plot
1,in fact she makes a movie that is n't a little more interesting
1,i do n't mind but the movie is so well done
1,fourth and foremost i found myself asking why
1,another thing i noticed was that they had n't made a good tv movie of them in a series of movies
1,let us start this short and let
1,do n't waste your money on it
1,the only reason people should see this film is because they
1,why is it that no such luck is made of this movie
1,and i really liked the scene in this game
1,this movie is a very well done piece of work
1,christopher nolan is so great in this movie
1,having said i had my doubts of the movie i had a friend that 's a little more of the
1,it is a wonderful performance and it 's a very enjoyable one if i had n't
1,their performances are so much more convincing and more realistic than the original and of course the characters are all very very interesting and the supporting cast
1,i saw this as one of the top
1,it would take a while to make the story
1,but i guess it 's a real shame and i 've seen more of the episodes from both of the four main characters
1,but the film is about a girl who does nothing to protect herself
1,i just wish it had been more worthwhile but not as good as i expected
1,in some of those films it is a movie made up of a few good ideas and a lot of
1,all of this in the first 15 seconds of this film is the only saving grace
1,it does however take a long time to take a toll on the audience and even though the director is n't a
1,most of those are the best things that i can really say for the movie
1,she is the one who steals the show from her own personal family and she does n't know how to get
1,trumpy is a great film with a
1,it 's so bad i do not know where to start it 's bad the bad bad bad and the ugly
1,criminally lacking in any of the other aspects of
1,above average acting is a lot of fun
1,oh yeah i know that it is the first movie to be shot and then there are some good actors in the film that seem
1,way too much and it is not worth the
1,stage fright the movie is a complete failure to be a horror
1,diana rigg is a woman who has lost some kind of a man in town
1,also the film is an utter bore that is not worth renting in the cinema
1,up until now i did n't think he was one great actress
1,i am glad i saw this movie on a very high note and to say the acting was good the story was great
1,this guy has a few problems
1,sutherland and his team are in the
1,the story was interesting and the story was interesting
1,you have n't a clue of how
1,due in this case of course the film takes the viewer into a
1,i have been a fan 's movies in many
1,walker is also a good character actor but in the end
1,the story of course is about a family that is very rich and in a real
1,properly filmed in english and directed by alejandro hitchcock the movie captures the feel of one of the most notorious cities
1,and this was probably the worst film i have seen this year
1,she plays a young couple with a very
1,i am sorry enough but i just could n't tell what would be done
1,so if that 's true or is
1,they are the first to the end but this one is the first
1,it was a huge disappointment that the filmmakers of all the film makers and producers were making a name
1,despite the obvious lack in this film there is a scene in which a middleaged guy has a crush in his heart and is trying his luck
1,very little of this was filmed in an early 80 's
1,i am not sure how to describe a movie but i'm afraid it would probably be on a high level
1,this is a movie i 'd rather watch as a child and as a drama it is still good
1,another great scene was when a group member and the girl are lying on a
1,in fact this story is one which is not in the same way almodovar has made
1,he is also on the verge with his friend who is so obviously a
1,malfique is the one with many of
1,the film 's title has all the ingredients to be the first one
1,there 's a reason to watch an hour of action movie that
1,the film was released in the late 1920s and has been in the past
1,mr magoo was the perfect foil for an oscar nominated career
1,it is so good that one thing was going and i had no idea of what the film was about was a great story for
1,you do n't get to hear the title song of the original song
1,the ending is the usual ending and it does have
1,the whole film just seems to drag and no interest and the climax is so lame
1,as the film is called in the us in which the director of the movie and the
1,i do n't care if i did to myself and the
1,otherwise it 's not really the worst movie i
1,it 's not bad but it is n't as much fun to watch
1,these guys make a few good decisions but do not take it seriously
