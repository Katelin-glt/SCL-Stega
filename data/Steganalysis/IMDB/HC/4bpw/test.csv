0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,it 's not an easy film it is not
1,i ca only recommend this movie for diehard fans of horror movies that are as bad as i do n't get the whole movie
1,the script for this movie was quite simple
1,i did n't like this movie
1,also the movie seems to be the same
1,however the movie is filled up with a good story by an
1,finally a friend of mine bought a cd of this film and the soundtrack was absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack was
1,but when the film hits the mark i thought of it as
1,the story line revolves around the death of a mysterious killer in the woods
1,overall it is one of those movies to watch and it is really worth watching
1,aside from being in the theater this movie has to go to be on a very small list
1,the acting of the movie 's characters was so unbelievable that i was n't sure whether there were two or three more people involved who had the
1,i saw this movie when i were 17 and still think it is cool and scary
1,the film is not that interesting as is due for the rest
1,i think the reason why it was so great was because it did
1,i do n't mean time is the same thing that made the movie
1,the actors playing the main character are not very interesting but in a very believable way
1,what the f is there to tell him
1,also the only reason i'm in the film is because this movie should never have received a proper score
1,there are a lot more of which i will have
1,the acting is ok there are some moments where you get a glimpse at the life
1,inside jokes and situations are always funny and there are several jokes from
1,he 's got a lot of screen time as he gets it
1,so much has been made with this
1,he was a great actor and did what he could with his material
1,i do not think that was meant for the movie
1,i am not a fan of the books which is
1,then again he 's in charge of the business
1,my favorite character was the way he talks of it
1,maybe that is due to the good of the actors
1,to begin with the movie does contain a few
1,as the world of war the war was over the top and not much else
1,but there was n't a single thing to it
1,i saw it last night and loved it
1,i had trouble picking up the whole premise and i did n't think
1,fast paced and a bit of nudity
1,it is a good movie but it is very weak and should n't do that
1,although the story had potential in its technical structure its a very bad movie
1,the movie 's premise is quite simple for the film but
1,sure there are plenty better movies out then you have to go to
1,bujold plays a great man who is
1,and as for what she really is he is so beautiful
1,joan crawford does n't look like her role
1,these are minor themes with the story and acting the film 's characters
1,each person is a stereotype of one 's lives and a man who is trying
1,but the story is that the story
1,the only problem with the movie is that it is based on a true
1,only this time he 's a little girl who loves his old wife and has his
1,this is a great film and should have been awarded
1,well it 's not that bad but it 's just bad enough to be fun but nothing really
1,those who do not like it do not see the film
1,maybe this just means that there was something wrong and not just
1,it is also nice to see a film about the holocaust and not the holocaust 's history as well as
1,at times i have to suspend disbelief to get to this movie
1,and the ending did n't really make
1,you wo like this movie as soon
1,the first is a great performance by jeff wincott who is also superb in
1,moonlighting to a new generation of the most gifted directors of the day the director
1,costumes in general were a huge part of the production team the production values and
1,some of the scenes are the ones that are shot on video and that 's all i got
1,well there 's a lot more to it than that but not enough
1,also as a result the plot is pretty poor
1,what i thought was a great film to have a good movie about being the norm who had the chance to be and a few people
1,he 's also the only character that he does n't do as well as his
1,there 's no other way to get that movie on you
1,there is no suspense no tension or tension
1,the movie was also pretty funny
1,this movie is just a waste
1,the director 's decision to use his voice is a bit heavyhanded for the plot but it 's just too much and there are some interesting moments
1,that said a pretty lame movie
1,i could n't see more reason to
1,now i know a movie can get so bad its good because
1,in fact there were several funny lines about the movie
1,i do n't care whether the film makers will or not as much if i had seen the latter one and only to give the two stars i would have been a part 2 i would recommend this to anyone who likes movies and have read
1,the main character is also a good person to go to
1,if you want more of these films you can enjoy that
1,he is a man that is constantly trying out of trouble but does n't seem
1,eddie murphy is excellent in his small role as the tough man
1,she 's not a bad guy
1,personally if he had not already planned me on a copy this would probably be the
1,women like to look at it in an american way in a way of being a great actress
1,all of these factors were so obvious that it made a great impact for them and for the first time they decided the end would be as satisfying
1,as much of the movie 's story it was really boring
1,most people think that this film was a good one
1,how come from the opening of the scene
1,i'm glad i did not write this comment
1,note that he was in prison and had the most successful one at the office
1,why i ca only say that if you can find it anywhere on the telly watch this movie and then watch it
1,save your time and time do n't waste your money or money on these movies
1,but the best thing is the performances from everyone in
1,how much of a plot line is this
1,but then the story is about an escaped convict who
1,under pressure for a few dollars this movie is not for everyone
1,it was a shame i never heard of it
1,he 's very good in every scene
1,ok i saw this film at an english film festival and i 've seen better in my reviews but the fact is that
1,there is not a single drop in
1,the characters are so well portrayed that the film is really well done
1,this is a classic film that is
1,outstanding acting great story and wonderful soundtrack by a great cast and a
1,it 's just a great story line and great performances by all involved
1,jodie foster is a woman that has become a successful actress in movies
1,for those who hate the film do yourself a favour avoid it at the time and you
1,anyone else who likes to watch this movie has n't seen the show on my list of many times since the last 15
1,it was n't as though a man had the potential for her
1,rhames and his friend who are trying too hard to survive
1,the first one with all of that is a good one
1,in fact the film takes a little more seriously than just the right blend of genres and romance
1,today she is a man who was married to an adult child and is still struggling to live in an
1,the film is full throttle and the action is so badly choreographed that it becomes a pity that the rest had the feel to it
1,break a little resemblance with a high tech horror
1,this movie is a very enjoyable piece to take a trip to an abandoned theater
1,it is all so extreme as to be a bit of fun to listen too
1,i have never seen the original in it 's entirety but i still
1,there will be a story that will do a disservice as to what it has to be of a certain sort of
1,unfortunately he also wrote some books
1,there 's something for the actors of the calibre of the stars who are n't too hard to get to know them
1,i'm glad that i watched it because i was
1,one of the better things about the movie is that i had to watch it to see
1,this is not my thing but it does have its purpose in my view
1,anyway i do n't remember seeing the
1,this is a great series to watch with its friends and friends as the season is in
1,it 's not only a vehicle that is not only bad but bad
1,when the movie begins this little gem comes to an abrupt finish where we can hear the words of the same person
1,the music in all my sons will not
1,it 's not a very good movie
1,all of the acting is passable
1,i would give this film 0 out it was so boring
1,all of these are the most important things to say
1,however for the viewer i do n't even want it as
1,i have a friend and sister
1,the script and acting are just ok
1,but the plot was a bunch to put together a movie that could n't have been good
1,when she meets her she 's trying desperately to seduce someone and her sister is
1,do n't let your children watch this movie and
1,she looks at it as if that happened just before going on a rampage
1,what a shame to hear some more
1,the acting is poor and the direction is atrocious
1,my only criticism would be that it would have
1,repetitive characters who did not have anything remotely important in depth to their motivations of the characters themselves
1,the plot was pretty dumb and the acting was horrible
1,where is our hero 's story of
1,her mother and daughter were in the middle of a mental institution when the woman was the only ones that had
1,i am a huge john wayne fan and i think he 's a good
1,that was just the right frame and the
1,lots is a good film a great film that is worth seeing again
1,the story is quite predictable though
1,in fact he is the best character on the show
1,it 's not a big budget production
1,joe don baker who played erin in the movie plays the character of the original series
1,the film has many elements in it including some nice shots of a young couple being stalked by one
1,art is a part of the way to hollywood when the audience is talking
1,then a man who gets a call that he knows how he could come in contact with
1,george hearn is a great choice for the role
1,the story of the kelly family who were trying to find the lost civilization and to return home to them was just as bad as a good and funny one like
1,there are also a number that are supposed to do the
1,and the acting in this film sucks
1,reiner did that with the exception in the
1,there are also some good performances in the cast
1,feels like a waste is not worth bothering with but
1,of the thousands of passengers they 're going through their paces
1,you could n't get more of the fact that you have to choose your own problems for this series the same way the
1,if you have never seen a film with such a great cast and can be
1,pros that 's all there is for the director
1,so if you are into the kind of thing to watch a bad film with a
1,i ca n't believe how it would have happened
1,in the meantime the viewer is treated by the director of that the movie
1,in short this was a fun movie to look at
1,the cast was n't particularly good
1,in addition the movie was also directed at the same time as it should not work as a director
1,there were some really great bits in which some people like myself
1,the movie is based on a true love story and it really does n't work for me
1,barbara bach a young woman in an early age
1,fished in for one night with a woman in the back with no luck in the city and the police find it easy to make a mistake
1,mama 's character in the beginning is a bit of an egotistical selfcentered
1,in my opinion as an adult movie there is a good movie lurking somewhere between this and suspiria
1,due it all this movie fails
1,lame movie like i would n't want to be a
1,kathy bates is superb as always
1,but the only thing that could make this movie watchable would be to make it more exciting for the kids to
1,i 've always been a fan and was very impressed with that
1,the acting in this movie is horrible
1,there is the usual slapstick comedy and the characters are n't likable
1,i do n't have any expectations for the story but in fact it
1,james stewart was excellent too i guess he was a little too much of a stretch for it
1,go with the flow of this
1,growing in the dark the story and the atmosphere and the atmosphere created by the main character is the only thing
1,while the movie tries too hard to capture the feeling of the film the plot becomes a little thin
1,far too much effort to be given the opportunity to get to be a serious movie and not just for a few bucks
1,maybe i'm going to go ahead and do whatever the f word was this
1,heman does it with a huge twist and he goes to
1,to me she is a good actress who could make her acting great
1,the story is simple to follow
1,gladly it is not a complete loss
1,but it 's the most fun thing about it
1,polygamy is a very poor version of shakespeare
1,concept of the movie has some very important issues about how the government and the american union in the 50 's and 50 other people
1,they did not get the chance to
1,i was a big time fan of my early fifties
1,its hard not put into words
1,after seeing a few episodes of the simpsons that i have seen this time it 's really just the same thing
1,the acting in the movie was so bad it boggles
1,in fact that 's all i can see about the people who wrote this i have to give the first one away
1,the first is the story line
1,nothing really interesting here it 's just boring
1,few of this movie 's budget is adequate
1,no matter the story is the same story
1,do not waste your time watching it if it did n't
1,also there 's not a moment here
1,how is the character of his own character in the beginning that he feels
1,on the cover of this dvd we have to give a
1,woody is the one who is always a good actor but the film does n't get the oscar he deserved
1,we get a few hints of a young black woman who was abused by a woman in
1,and then there was the scene with mr beetle walking around like he was supposed to look at me a couple times when he jumped out of the
1,in fact i have n't seen this film many
1,the acting is not bad except that this guy who plays
1,this episode is about a couple of students who run into a group to retrieve it on a camping train in the middle of nowhere and they
1,unless you 're looking for a good scifi movie that can only be enjoyed to have a soft spot on it then it 's not worth renting
1,since he has a very bad movie career it would be the perfect movie for the kids
1,one thing that bothered the movie was that the ending seemed
1,yes the film is an attempt to be a comedy but it is n't
1,added to all this is said by the director and all the actors have their own agenda
1,ben affleck is in this one
1,this film was made for tv that the critics had to get away
1,it may have been a good movie in
1,the director has not yet tried to convey all the emotions with the
1,you can see some of this is a good film
1,war was about two men who have been kidnapped by the indians in the past
1,about 30 years later the story itself is not all that memorable and there is no story there is no reason why some viewers want to have a movie on its mind like this
1,with a bit of gore there is a lot of good old movies such a bad movie that i 've got to say
1,tragically i ca n't understand why some of us actually watched this movie
1,add to that the fact that you have to wait for one or two scenes to make one laugh about sex in the
1,some scenes are great in some parts of the movie especially the scenes of
1,petula bening looks ravishing and she has a
1,if you like a bit of the movie this will be the one for you
1,cast the story of a guy who kills a man and goes to
1,the story is simple and is the worst i have seen in a
1,it makes the viewer feel like that 's
1,park is a real character not unlike his dad
1,the acting is so bad that i have seen thousands of other movies
1,and he is just a normal person
1,it may have also been a classic a parody to those of you who are
1,correct spoiler spoilers the story is not bad but
1,cruise in his last film is the story of
1,this movie should be seen by everyone and everyone and one that is definitely not in the world
1,too much screen writing is a poor excuse to make a movie that seems to
1,they do make us believe that their children
1,it 's not a good movie but it 's a little fun and is definitely worth the time to view the trailer and the
1,i think if i were to pick up on my own mind
1,otherwise the whole thing looks good
1,a must have for any fan or any of
1,all i had to work was my favorite movie and it was so good and it has its flaws but the
1,there are some very nice twists and many memorable scenes like when she goes with the girl the woman the woman is supposed and the way her parents do
1,it 's not just a movie it is about a guy who does not want his
1,i'm surprised that the writers were making such an awful film about it the only thing that makes a horror film is the ending
1,who has the problem going for it all
1,they were so great and so funny
1,i just have the feeling that the film makers did a lot of homework for creating
1,the director is a little selfindulgent and the acting was just as bad
1,there are several scenes where the audience is treated to such a lame ending in the end
1,but there will be a lot to be proud of this movie
1,all in all this is a must see for all fans of the old tv show
1,this is a very very funny movie
1,its only redeeming feature is the very strong acting and the fact that you 're watching a documentary that the director is
1,it 's really a good movie especially considering the circumstances of the day
1,the film follows a group who decide to have a party with a young woman named melissa who is a bit of a
1,my friend and we were all waiting to see it
1,we 're never sure whether the audience would want to be
1,the movie is very entertaining with the use of
1,the main characters in each other and the characters develop their
1,this is a movie that should have
1,the first time you get the opportunity to
1,but if you do n't see this film at least do it justice or do n't want
1,this movie makes it all the less disturbing because it is more exciting
1,said that it is a movie with no good reason to be
1,the actors are just so great and the characters and their situations all work perfectly but you do n't get bored that these characters are all that interesting
1,no one has to rely on the acting or the other
1,i do recommend it to you
1,we get that in our eyes that the main character in all of these characters is a little too anal and the
1,this movie is about a group that moves around to solve their problems as they try to stop their parents' business in the middle
1,no i do n't like to give
1,and the other actors who have no good reason whatsoever do the whole thing is n't worth
1,lushly filmed and beautifully written in the same way as this film was it was filmed very good so the movie
1,bava 's direction of a film that takes a backseat for this film is the best thing about the movie
1,the characters are likable enough and the story is well told and the
1,it is a movie that shows no emotion and that is not what we are meant to see
1,this is a very bad movie and a bad waste for it 's badness and it has some really nice special effects
1,i would love it if they were n't so funny in the first thirty minutes
1,one of those films that you have to watch and you will
1,a very good action flick with a great cast excellent cast and the story of the real lindy 's journey is just a great performance
1,finding that it 's not as funny as it should at times be an example
1,my advice do so unless you are a diehard fan of hers
1,it is very sad that the film never made a mockery to any other studio movie
1,while the movie contains the worst performance of the year
1,master of the zombies is an extremely entertaining and suspenseful film
1,not the worst movie ever made or even but a good movie and should have been nominated best picture at the box office for best director and it was
1,all the characters are likable and believable as well because they are so very very
1,he 's always in the same position as the character we see as a boy
1,it was a good idea to get a copy of a decent movie from the late 80 another
1,lots and lots of laughs ensue
1,the main focus is at the end and of course he 's not
1,to see this movie will have to go on on its entirety as a feature movie
1,i have read a few of these reviews and found some interesting things about how i could download a copy
1,but if you are really bored to see this movie try the one
1,the only difference comes from him when he finally comes to the aid he has to take over and
1,s story about a mysterious man who lives
1,is there is more a chance to see her
1,he does n't want to go back to the school where the kid takes the puppies
1,imagine all the actors who have a really bad name on movies that are n't bad
1,so they do n't go into the basement and they do the usual thing on the head or maybe they 'll have them
1,luckily a film has the benefit in its plot which is very disappointing
1,the only thing that i got from this episode was that it was an old vhs game for sale on a local saturday morning
1,at the end of this movie i knew exactly why they did that
1,and the fact that it is just a love affair is so prevalent and its so
1,watched this movie last night and it was a good movie
1,she is a great talent for all the wrong reasons
1,this is one of my favorite films
1,the only difference between the whole movie and a 2 is the fact it has a great supporting cast
1,wells did not have the talent of a hollywood production
1,why did he even get his hands on the movie to
1,i would not have made him better as the main cast
1,nothing is funny or original but rather a comedy
1,derek 's character has to be one of the dumbest i have seen in a very small screen performance
1,when you think the movie was shot in video format it 's a very poor
1,3 out of 5 and 10 for the movie itself
1,john malkovich is a great actor as is the character of alex
1,to me that it was a very low budget movie but
1,the acting is superb the cinematography and art photography and lighting was excellent
1,i think that the director wanted this movie so that it would make it so successful
1,where is one film after another
1,what is with the real life of the man behind the wheel
1,the plot is simple as is usual in the movie
1,the film is quite funny but is also not in the same league as the ones in which the actors are mostly funny because they are n't funny
1,credits include spoilers but the film is a lot of times
1,this story is so predictable it makes
1,the first thing that is more interesting is that he is one hell of people in a real world with whom he can
1,talking of the film and you know that
1,it 's not that i do n't enjoy it
1,the whole thing is very interesting
1,just before the credits roll we get a little of the plot
1,dad 's wife and dad have to spend some time together in an old apartment
1,if the director and his fellow crew wanted them to be on
1,i had heard many reviews before seeing a few comments of the imdb comment on the positive comments of this movie i thought i thought
1,how the hell can one deny a movie like that
1,actually this film was an okay way to spend 90 of 90 minutes and the movie is so stupid to watch
1,by the end the movie has been released by the
1,the first half of this film are pure crap with no real plot at that it 's a bit of a rehash to another of those films
1,it 's not worth mentioning but i'm not a big sandra fan or any of that type of horror or exploitation films of her generation
1,it has its ups and lows and i would recommend this film to anyone with a
1,so the movie 's story and some of his most powerful moments were just a little jarring and could 've been
1,everybody else looks like an animal
1,all of it is done with a little bit more than a little fuzzy
1,of course we are in a state the same eras that we saw in the movie
1,certainly one of the best i 've seen
1,i would n't be surprised if that is a
1,this movie was n't even so awful at times but the acting is good
1,for the sake he 's a fine actor
1,most of the characters in my first encounter with the main character were quite interesting the story was intriguing enough it was a bit more
1,hillarious little action thriller that takes place on a beach
1,one of the worst parts i had seen was that of a man
1,or just let her do the same thing
1,fortunately the acting was bad the acting was
1,how was this film made and released in 1987 in the near completion of
1,beasts and geeks is a movie that deserves
1,the actors are n't very good either but they are not
1,get what i got from the movie
1,like many great movies you get to see
1,same goes for it to keep you
1,now i'm just typing the review and i have never
1,anyway the main problem is that it is n't the best
1,however i ca like the movie
1,none of the characters are interesting enough to save the movie from getting together from other sources
1,the whole idea of the film was to try to save the world from the land but
1,sly 's character is the perfect everyman
1,he 's the main reason why this film gets to be one
1,but the acting is great the film 's direction is flawless
1,however the fact remains that it is a pretty lousy movie
1,but you have to have to watch this to end
1,one thing that i do n't like is that there would be a lot more to him in his life
1,a young man who is forced to do something
1,question is i think there is no such thing and it was really a
1,the whole thing is a very different view
1,which is the case with the rest of the movie and the film has more than the actual amount of blood in my eyes
1,greetings from hell was one of her worst movies
1,the acting is n't bad but i found myself laughing at the lack
1,the whole show takes place at new york city with a few friends in an apartment building
1,the acting is awful the effects are boring except for two characters who are very wooden
1,given the cast and script this will be a film to watch
1,a film which takes place in this country and the people who have lived
1,i did n't care if it had been
1,that 's where a movie of the
1,the plot is basically an attempt
1,4 stars out of 10 stars
1,it 's just the usual clich and the movie itself is not
1,george romero was also responsible in directing
1,careers for example do not have the same flair to
1,but that 's what you have to do with you
1,one thing that 's funny because they do n't have the ability to use to make them out of the gutter
1,the plot is n't quite right
1,in conclusion a lot better than most bmovies this one is n't as great as the original but it 's
1,beyond that i found an extra star for the production designers and a very good looking movie
1,this is another movie where everyone involved in the making of this film should have given the book the chance
1,the story was good it had a great cast
1,i am so disgusted i was watching this film
1,the movie is a complete waste of time money and effort
1,instead it was not very funny
1,the film was also filled with a sense of humor as we all have in the book and it is the film 's own point
1,rather than a simple plot this does not excuse a very compelling view of
1,from then on he 's just as funny and funny
1,plus that 's a bit part
1,the movie itself takes us down in a very long charged state
1,this is a movie from beginning to end
1,in the end when the movie 's climax comes it 's a pity the only time i have seen it
1,it 's not for anyone and i ca all think people are enjoying them
1,sally silverstone is so sexy as that she has no lines
1,and the rest of the story is just not a bad one
1,like many other reviewers have commented on this one
1,if you like the first movie you have n't read a lot
1,the cast is pretty damn good but the director has the
1,however the story is rather lame and the actors are really good especially the one who plays the lead
1,the movie has a number of funny
1,after the movie it started as part
1,unfortunately these men are never going for a long period of history
1,the first film of the original trilogy was a very enjoyable one and should have stayed with my
1,go watch it to see why it
1,i have always been a fan and
1,they 've never made a movie like that anymore
1,now the film has a chance at the festival
1,well this one is definitely more fun for those with a taste
1,for the most memorable scenes the last scene in particular is very touching as the two boys are forced into a trap by a very attractive boy who is so shocked that they are left alone
1,i was really impressed with it for the whole story
1,this is not a film where a woman is raped by the
1,and it seems the director had a great time doing
1,it 's a pretty decent movie that is very entertaining and is recommended by
1,the actors seem like something out there somewhere there was no chemistry between them
1,unfortunately the director is a little too astute
1,a good movie is the sort of thing that could have been a decent family drama of a group
1,i ca n't imagine anything more than that of a bunch of friends
1,as for that bit more and more than what was in the first movie and the
1,i have always laughed from the beginning to the end and this movie
1,never has that been so bad
1,in fact this movie is about the power of life that i have seen and the story is almost all over
1,i 've always enjoyed the movie but
1,for instance after a few episodes of the film i was
1,interesting but it is also more than anything and it 's the first and last scene
1,but in fact i was looking forward at the time and seeing a few
1,to be a very interesting person and most importantly he can act
1,save your kids rent a dvd
1,some of the special effects look like they were lifted in the day of filming
1,they were the first to end the movie
1,this is the first movie where she is supposed a film for all to know it 's about to happen
1,there was the odd guy who was trying too hard and the whole
1,now you know it was bad enough to pass you out of the theater
1,for one the only ones who do better with a lot of fun are the ones that were very stupid
1,i was also surprised that the movie is not only boring as the plot unfolds at it by the end of the film
1,then we see the two young women dressed out with some of its heels
1,the plot twists and characters make the story a bit convoluted at least
1,so it was the last of the great horror films and was actually one that
1,ok i'm not one you will have nothing to say
1,she has been able on many things to her death by killing her own brother
1,but that 's a great movie that should stick together
1,the acting the script the characters the plot the special effects just make me want to yell
1,i have not seen a horror flick
1,at least in the first ten seconds of the film you see the end result
1,instead this story takes place in a small town where the students are forced to participate in the wild west
1,joe pesci played a lot of action hero who was a very funny part
1,gavras and the producers should have stayed with this film at one time with such
1,her character 's name is so awful and it makes any sense but she plays her character very seriously
1,normally i feel compelled in order but i really did
1,his character did n't even seem interesting or even funny to begin with
1,it 's about the power and love of the boy 's wife to the
1,russell does not disappoint and the whole thing is a waste
1,the only other way i can say is this i do agree
1,i have no idea about the acting and directing but not so well done
1,she 's also a good character
1,the film also has a lot less plot twists and the main plot line was so
1,where the plot is about the killer in that is what is supposed to have been a few of us
1,do we really need a more serious approach to
1,so do yourself some favor and check out some of those movies
1,i had heard about it from a very different age of 20 years but i still remember that
1,a woman of the year to a high class of a life of the young man
1,but the best part of my viewing in
1,it 's not the kind of movie you would expect to find
1,some of the scenes are so far out to keep it 's interesting and moving
1,peter cushing is also excellent and it 's his performance that makes the movie even better to watch and a lot
1,it is just a good movie to view
1,this film should not be taken away from the
1,unfortunately the ending is pretty lame
1,it 's all about as much a movie about a guy as he has
1,it is an enjoyable movie and the acting was great
1,i have to admit that i 've tried some of his other work as the devil but he 's still not that bad or the bad guy
1,see them on a sunday morning
1,indeed i have to add to the comment that all this is not what i would call me
1,the story follows the lives and realities of
1,for me this would have helped this film to end all the way
1,in this movie is one of them
1,released in 1995 this film is about a young woman who has to choose his mother to the daughter of her son
1,but i still have to say that i 've never seen this movie in its run
1,yes the movie may be a bit slow but the movie is very entertaining
1,by far we could have been more so excited with what we 're seeing but this show is so bad it 's good'
1,and this one is the only one of
1,there was a lot of time and effort to keep the film and pace along and the script is
1,the only thing that keeps me from giving this
1,it 's about a young woman named melissa who is kidnapped by her father and a young
1,i just saw the first part the night i had seen the first one and i did n't really get to see much of the
1,the acting is n't quite bad in places but not enough to save
1,as an avid moviegoer i was bored to
1,but the fact that he is a woman he has
1,you know you 're watching this but you have to be warned
1,it seems that he was killed by a monster at a time because he 's not afraid for that
1,the actors playing the bad cop who ca by pretending to be evil and the whole thing is the dumbest i
1,my rating is higher but this movie makes a lasting statement about this movie that
1,the acting is excellent and the direction is very effective
1,he 's an excellent director with great timing but
1,after all a woman 's daughter is kidnapped by a man who has to do with the accident
1,anyhoo this is the first movie i have seen in a movie
1,it is a very sad movie that will stay true for you not to waste time on the couch as well
1,like i said the actors did some fine work
1,i have n't laughed so well since i
1,then there 's a movie which tries to show us something that can
1,on this occasion the acting is excellent
1,shot on location in australia and in the early 80 's
1,it is also about the relationships between each other 's lives and the consequences of life
1,it 's a great story and well worth it
1,the cast is also strong in a small part
1,like many others the movie was just too weak to be enjoyable
1,the whole film is so predictable i can barely see why it was so bad at the start
1,next the first scene is a bit of an illicit joke but it is too
1,i really do n't care if the movie was just
1,considering the movie is full moon 's first feature film this is a good film
1,there 's even worse than to be sure
1,the main character is about to become human friends
1,their character is so stupid that he can be killed
1,the movie is a complete waste that should be banned for years
1,the movie is a true gem of the film
1,greg kinnear looks embarrassed that he ca all over
1,to be fair the film 's message remains intact the acting was superb
1,much in a very poor attempt to save this poor attempt at an american accent i did n't care
1,the plot is a simple love affair and there is a lot
1,korea is also a movie that will entertain you
1,comedy is the story of a woman who loves the family 's problems and she tries to find her family in the ways of the new age of the new age
1,wonderful performances by robert montgomery edward rea and john gielgud
1,and it is very sad that it has
1,searching for a movie for a week in a local town
1,but even if there was a sequel of the book i 'd rather let you know that this is the worst movie that i 've ever watched
1,the acting from all involved is pretty good and the direction was good
1,a lot more of the actors have the ability their performances were given the same way in
1,whereas the movie is pretty dated the acting is horrible and the plot line
1,so i have watched it and will never get tired from watching
1,the actors are very good and you really see what they do with their time and each of the scenes
1,quite possibly the most memorable thing about the movie is
1,for a better movie the cast is a fine film
1,in one scene she is a victim
1,i have to say i'm surprised the movie was made at all i saw it again with its rerelease of the film on its entirety but not as good
1,then the camera zooms out of the window and she
1,anyway i would give it a 210 though for my review of the
1,they should be ashamed to be able a film made for
1,giving this film an 8 and a 10 is a great achievement
1,they had a little less than a little more than they
1,perhaps this film was intended for a younger crowd
1,so i have nothing in the uk and this show is no exception
1,with a lot of good movies in it they are all over the same
1,all in one sitting for the most exciting movie on the shelves
1,enter a new york town to attend the city of new
1,not in a good light it 's just a bit cheesy
1,to be honest i liked the film because the whole thing felt too real and
1,an excellent cast including all the supporting cast and
1,they 're not so much the same
1,barbara stanwyck as elizabeth is beautiful and she is perfect as her wife
1,i would be ashamed i had the privilege of watching this movie
1,this is a good film for me to say that is about as good an evening now as
1,this is a really funny movie a few years from me and i really enjoyed it
1,watching this for the first couple of years i thought that it is great
1,moreover he is just one man who could have been in a world where he would
1,it is a shame that such a beautiful woman
1,crappy acting bad script ridiculous dialogue
1,cravat plays the lead role with the charm and charm of the character of his father
1,i love it so i am a fan of all the classic horror movies i 've seen them
1,this is a very good movie
1,the actors are excellent in their own right
1,it 's not just a movie it
1,darius is a great actor but he does not carry it
1,is the movie a satire that should be
1,let us start with the plot twist ending
1,la antena is a great movie
1,also the movie itself is a complete mess
1,and for the sake he has the best character ever in the play this is a good
1,of it 's time it is a great family film and should be seen as part one of the many and
1,it 's all in the family
1,stunning camera work excellent cinematography wonderful performances by all
1,it 's a shame to hear a lot about this movie it 's not
1,and what does that have all the more to the
1,this is n't one to go out with to go and make you a little more of
1,but i could watch it a few more years
1,duchovny is a perfect actor he is great the rest
1,i'm not sure whether the story is just an excuse for a
1,during the depression scene the only thing that can be forgiven for a tv audience is to be shown in every episode
1,and it does serve a purpose but is ultimately not that good
1,the story is a bunch for the entire film in the series as a whole and it is about to end
1,the only good thing i can say about how good it is that is how she and the actress matured throughout the movie
1,so the plot gets progressively worse
1,it 's a little boring and boring to boot
1,the actors are the stars of the script which i do remember as the norm was n't a bad one
1,a group member in one of the men of the us forces and then the family and the
1,although it 's a very slow film you can expect the same amount of fun and humor that is the last thing in the movie that
1,now that 's a bit of a shame because it 's hard
1,the movie just has little or no point for the plot and for the
1,the movie is filled with flashbacks and scenes from the first film
1,many will be able for me and it
1,but the movie itself is not really a documentary and a movie that is n't quite as exciting as the original
1,i love it when they are in the right place at the movie 's end it is a
1,this is not a movie about two people who can cope with
1,now i do n't care much for you
1,in all a well acted film
1,the director did an excellent acting directing
1,it could have been much better as it was made in the first place
1,why would anyone like me who would like the movie
1,also there are a lot better ones out on this one
1,it 's not just him and the movie he does n't know what he says and it 's not even funny to make him look foolish
1,i really do n't know what to think
1,i ca n't understand how anyone could have done so bad acting
1,i'm also surprised that it does not have to make itself about the only thing interesting in the film
1,raoul walsh is the best thing in that movie
1,we do n't know what is going in in this case the plot or the plot
1,blessed to kill the evil guy and his family
1,branagh makes this a truly wonderful movie
1,i do agree with the reviewer that stated
1,the only one really was the guy
1,it is a good story and the two leads seem as if their relationship was the result of it
1,incidentally he was an alcoholic who wanted to kill him for that time because of the power surrounding the family
1,we have seen it all before
1,the characters and the situations all seemed the way this was made
1,if that means a new generation is an original film then you might want to be a part where there are people who like this movie but that 's what makes it great
1,if i had n't had a little time on the set i 'd just like to point out where to begin
1,i do mean that this was made for tv
1,its not a great story but its a good one
1,thomas who was once born in the town of england is still a bit suspicious
1,the movie is so bad it is so sad
1,to be frank the son says something
1,i do n't think so in the movie but it is n't too bad
1,he 's the hero for this
1,also a very funny scene featuring the old lady in the hotel
1,nicely done in its own way but not much fun
1,this is a must see for people who
1,i really liked the characters who were n't bad either but this just does work
1,too it was n't a film and it just does n't work very hard
1,it is very obvious that it is not even worth watching at all
1,there was a lot of action to satisfy the audience
1,the acting was good in every way
1,who is there to give a movie about the characters or story lines
1,hoffman had a few lines he had been in the movie but then again he has no character actor either
1,an example why is it a good film as it does a disservice of capturing the emotional
1,just as many movies were made in the 80 's as one can see the most gruesome aspect in the entire film is a sequence where the guy
1,there 's a reason that people will enjoy this movie
1,it 's a very interesting story
1,however the film has a certain degree to do with the two
1,there were many funny scenes with the one where the two girls discuss the relationship and a scene that goes between the main characters
1,although it is true to life that this story has been done the acting is great
1,although i have seen all of the episodes and seen it in reruns and television shows i can still say this one has a certain charm value on them and i will recommend it to anyone who enjoys it
1,the only positive thing about this production is that the story is about a bunch of people that are linked with the wrong reasons
1,she does not want it to take the risk out of her life and her parents
1,tracy has a very strong role to go
1,the acting from this movie is terrible and the writing was atrocious
1,the film was a bit of an improvement but it seemed to be something very different
1,most of these characters were the only
1,to say the film is n't about it is beyond ridiculous but that 's the point i
1,the main character is so boring that he seems to be having trouble getting into a situation that he can do
1,it 's a nice movie to watch in the context of
1,there are no laughs to be found here
1,seeing this movie will be much better than the usual suspects in the history of today
1,as for me i'm sure they 're trying to bring out all problems in a situation for a good and funny
1,rob roy is a master who likes to have a good time to
1,with some of the best lines and the most dramatic moment in the movie you are left wondering whether these are real people
1,it 's a good thing that many other film actors have the talent of a director
1,in short if only you can get a grip of the quality and depth that the director did for the film this is a
1,some of the best acting ever assembled in this movie
1,you have your usual teenage mutant roommate
1,the movie was n't for the fainthearted but
1,i have a friend who does not like watching a bunch and is really a
1,essentially it 's not that the movie lacks that
1,i 've been looking forward at the video store for a long long time
1,i saw this movie for the first time and found a new version in the library
1,it 's a bit of a shame that this film will be remembered from the library
1,ultimately it is a great show but it 's not for everyone
1,however it was so bad it was laughable and it
1,it is a complete and total insult
1,mainly the script is awful and poorly written and executed
1,although not the best i can say i have n't seen the whole one
1,he 's a bad actor who 's not funny at all
1,add an extra of extra shots that do n't really look like they 're done in some form of a big
1,his only son 's life of his brother is played in the middle of an attempt to help
1,i had high tolerance for this film because i'm a fan
1,wayne has a small cameo but a lot of what makes the difference between the actors and the actors
1,i love this movie and for this reason
1,left behind for the last 30 seconds and the
1,if you want to see an action film with a good story it 's worth a
1,if you want my share and a little of your life you should avoid this film at
1,if you liked it it 's the best thing to come out i think
1,2 the story of a mother who is
1,i do n't think that you could
1,the movie starts with an odd conversation about three people who are in a car crash
1,that 's all i can say
1,there are some good points to the show
1,i have been reading the book and seen some really bad movies
1,it is n't really an action film so the story is full of clichs and not a bit
1,this story does n't even have to go with the flow of its story and story
1,this is a great movie that is a mustsee
1,annie has n't been married with the daughter of yet so he is a teenager
1,let 's face this film 's title a few of my friends
1,as i said the acting is good with very few exceptions
1,beverly hills cop 2 was released in 1990 and released into the us international tv
1,my advice was to watch the show again after a
1,gee it 's not a good film to me
1,they all play it as straight as they do
1,the plot is a bit of an improvement on the viewer and does not deliver much and the film is quite well done the acting is great the script is very intriguing the directing and acting all give you
1,it 's not only the presence of the two actors who is also good and their performances the film is pretty
1,he was in the process for the entire movie
1,although i loved the book and the original version was a much better one it also was great
1,what makes this film so wonderful to be it is how they are not a common ground
1,there is no point to this movie
1,ellen barkin is a young woman in the business who has been accused from the past a married man
1,seriously this film is a complete mess
1,and the only time i was able to see this movie was the
1,that said this movie is a masterpiece
1,there are a few things that really make an enjoyable film
1,doris day was an absolute hoot
1,the music was great and the visuals are great the costumes are beautiful the photography is superb and the direction and acting is impeccable with
1,it is an excellent film and is highly entertaining
1,would you want to watch a lot
1,they 're also in full swing of the original and this is the only
1,we have all these things in this world that have nothing special or funny to show
1,also the whole plot has a very strong cast and a great director
1,ooh yeah i have never seen a worse movie
1,if i was n't that much older and more skilled i would say it
1,it 's a real shame that there were not some good performances like this
1,why the hell was the predator running the streets of the
1,this is not a comedy but if you enjoy
1,the ending is so abrupt that you do feel sorry for them
1,this is a movie that everyone should watch
1,seeing this movie was my second film
1,a little girl meets a girl who was killed and abused and tortured by her
1,the only one i can think about is the old lady who is played by elizabeth
1,other movies include the same characters which i think they did n't have to have to deal
1,if i had n't i would have been more impressed by the characters
1,but it 's not too bad for someone who is not a fan of the show
1,other than the fact that i ca only be a fan i
1,his character was played by a very nice guy
1,although some of these elements were interesting i thought the movie was quite enjoyable
1,this is a very good episode of the series
1,allinall it is not a complete waste of my time but it 's just as good and if the story will ever get the attention
1,the only good thing about it was its ability to capture the magic of an old school
1,i think the best scene in the movie occurs when the
1,these are my two movies and this is one of the best
1,he had a great deal of time and money but did n't want him to work
1,lane 's character was very funny
1,for the rest of us who would have loved to have watched this movie i 'd recommend it to others
1,one thing i liked about this movie
1,yes it 's a bad movie
1,despite the fact it 's a remake it just lacks any real surprises
1,i really liked the character of lucy who is a true beauty in this
1,any selfrespecting director could do it with a straight face
1,it is very funny when it comes to
1,although they may find the humor they have to work for themselves they 're all very smart
1,every episode was really really great
1,beckett plays the character of a real killer on the prowl in the early 90 other than this one
1,if you 're looking for something a few notches
1,coupled to the brim with the most recent and interesting films of
1,the film is just about as simple or boring
1,he is not as great as a man he loves to get in trouble is it
1,she is quite a good actress she is not only beautiful
1,the story is so simple that the plot is so weak as it is incomprehensible
1,here 's the story of three sisters with a family
1,just do you want to watch some of this
1,after the success of a film it has become a great success and i can safely say it was a brilliant film
1,another thing i liked about this film was the way the animals were portrayed
1,currie 's role here and so on as well as his contemporaries were not a total waste
1,they could n't act as the main storyline or the other two things are a little flat
1,the only thing good at the beginning of the episode is that the kids have no idea about
1,larry 's son and brother are all too busy to be killed
1,the only thing that saved me about the movie though was the way the movie
1,and i am a little puzzled to see all the
1,so if you are looking for a
1,it was n't funny to me so i watched it all the first time and it would have been
1,philippe was a good character in the original
1,whatever the case is that you do n't
1,i am a huge david decoteau fan and he 's really just a bad
1,the story revolves on the lives of several people who have no clue about their lives and are unable
1,most of the acting is very good
1,jack lemmon is not one of them and he 's
1,anyone who is looking for an intelligent psychological film should see this
1,a woman who 's in a wheelchair
1,devoted to the book he 's given it the chance to be a part in which there 's a big payoff
1,the first time he is a guy at the
1,totally wasted in this movie and the fact that
1,but it 's like they are going nowhere
1,the director is just plain annoying
1,the movie takes the story out a little bit but it fails
1,well i 've heard it is my best game and it 's not as bad as you can think
1,peter boyle is a master actor and he makes this movie his
1,i'm just thinking about it this is a pretty good film for anyone 's taste for the horror genre that is spinal and i love it for
1,they all should be ashamed of them
1,the movie is not a bad one but
1,the movie is about a young woman in the country who is
1,thanks to this film there will be no need
1,however they had to make a short length which were made to get more attention and better to be made
1,i do n't want to spoil the movie by comparing it to the other similar movies which are good but i feel they are n't really good
1,just remember it a great film and a truly excellent one it 's a very enjoyable movie
1,the only thing that is good about this movie is the soundtrack
1,that is a shame since that is the only way i 've ever seen him in
1,after seeing the film the film becomes very interesting when a character is told that he is a werewolf of
1,the only problem i had is that it is almost identical to any of the other movies
1,as for me i do n't agree that the movie is
1,while it has a very long shot of the original film the film
1,in the early 80 's this was probably due in the end of the
1,that was not enough but it was so bad
1,it 's the best movie ever made
1,do n't be surprised by it 's lack of
1,homosexuals are n't as easy as the characters in this one
1,what a great show the acting is
1,natural and roman was one of those movies with english dubbed that could be called a french
1,well you will see what you do last summer
1,the director and producers should have made a movie about this man 's life as a character
1,but in this case the film does not even make any sense of any of it at all like
1,then it takes the audience to take a long time to get involved
1,it was n't funny at all and it has no sense of humor to it either
1,rugged characters who go on to do very little in their lives
1,the director seems to have an ear for the project but as the movie goes on the cake falls
1,by now there is a lot more to this and more of the action scenes
1,before you know you know what to do with your life
1,the first part where a man kills a dog in the face
1,we get the chance to get the message that there are things going more on your life than a good man
1,the director is so much more human and even less interesting than this
1,the movie is quite a bore at times but it never develops
1,this is not a documentary it 's a documentary
1,its the best film i have ever seen in a theatre and i 've always wondered where to start with the actors who played the lead actors so well i was so excited
1,then the guy is a kid who goes on a killing spree for another woman to find out why he is the father and who he was n't
1,it was great to have a lot more
1,for the first time when the show premiered was released from prison we were on our own
1,in addition to the success it 's all too easy and so on and so much that 's really good
1,i had heard that it is going nowhere
1,as a result this is a rather silly film with its emphasis
1,the first thing a big budget director should have done with
1,the plot was a little too long for a movie but it was good
1,it 's not so bad that it actually resembles it but it was n't so great
1,that said the script was pretty weak
1,the acting the scenery the costumes everything is so bad
1,i saw this on a sneak pile of the day it looked great
1,unfortunately they are all a bunch of people that do not know each others
1,i was surprised when the film was released in the early nineties at the turn it is so hard that i would not be
1,shame this movie is not for the fainthearted at all
1,after seeing the trailer i do n't know that it is n't the first film to
1,after that it was a movie to entertain
1,he is not at the top here
1,simple plot twists are the standard of all
1,a lot of the actors have to be the most talented actor on board in a very limited role and they were
1,gulliver 's experiment at the end is a perfect metaphor and the end result does
1,i have no idea why but the film does n't
1,the director also uses his style of tricks with a camera
1,also the actors did n't even act like a good director and it was n't really all that bad either it 's all really bad i suppose but i could only stand that much of the
1,twist for your own life you will enjoy to be your nearest hero and will
1,if you like movies in general you might think it does n't need to go anywhere
1,for example the scene with her mother is the worst of her in the movie with a scene
1,he is one very strong guy that really makes
1,hey there 's a twist ending and that does n't even seem like a
1,if you were a child or a teenager you would n't find this movie interesting
1,michael and her are all very good actors in the film
1,if this was the same sort of film for a lot of people this is one film
1,the actors do n't seem to get very
1,none other then a good example of that
1,the only problem i have with this episode is the music and that 's just it
1,why would you have been a big fan
1,stockings in cheek but that was the most ridiculous part
1,the main reason it gave me a headache about it was
1,the movie 's plot revolves a group of people who just want to get married to the evil spirits and make the best of his problems
1,but i was still surprised when my gf saw this movie
1,all these things are just fine
1,i was n't expecting much from this film since i thought the film would be pretty good because of the way the movie ended
1,one of my favorite parts of all times
1,unbelievably the film does not have an undertone of its complexity and does n't have to
1,if you have not seen it you will have much fun for it
1,soon enough i was surprised to see the director put a lot more work
1,the main plot is that of two women who have a secret to go on a train trip to the countryside to try their luck
1,8 minutes of that i ca all
1,as it is the movie is still a lot of a great thriller
1,he is a great actress who has made great movies of this era and this is not a good thing
1,this is n't a bad idea either
1,if there is one thing i hate about these characters
1,foot in a sea is an absolute hoot
1,the story was not great and was n't really a film that was very funny but also the
1,and it 's so much fun for me
1,the first time i watched it it still was good
1,the acting is awful by everyone 's favorite actor and the direction
1,it was made in 1938 and is a must see again for any fan who loves
1,the whole thing is about as far as acting goes by its own good as it is a great movie
1,i saw that in the first place and in a couple days of the week i was
1,even the soundtrack was n't too original in this movie but it 's a bit over the top because of its shortcomings
1,there are also some great acting and some
1,as such i could n't imagine any of the characters the story
1,a very good example is how she longed to get his own child out of it for his life and how he can be so disgusted by
1,sixth it 's a bit of one of
1,the movie is n't a bad movie as a whole but it 's not
1,i was also surprised by how many times during the course of her life i kept
1,the film was very well made and the story was very good and the actors were all good
1,ghosthouse has a nice story with excellent acting but the movie is not bad at times but it
1,it 's one of the most bizarre movies ever made in recent years
1,however there was a way to enjoy it
1,we 're supposed to root out of this guy
1,slow paced the camera angles are n't very good and
1,the plot of the movie is just bad and i ca all think about the plot
1,after the first five minutes i was n't even going enough
1,peoples the story is about a couple of who have a relationship and love to a girl
1,waiters all of that is done by a man of his own with only a few of it 's
1,it 's not that the movie was bad
1,devito is the perfect villain with a lot better to
1,lynda and ashley are so hot that it was actually hard to see them
1,what makes this even more interesting was the scene that
1,lucky for him he 's just a bit of fun
1,maria the woman who made him in love with her and her husband has left to decide what
1,ferrer has a great performance in the movie he 's
1,it is a story that has the potential to be a comedy
1,but he 's a good man and a pretty good guy
1,he has the talent of his fellow friends and is one the best of all
1,too bad it does n't go back to
1,she is just a good guy in fact you 'll get something of a chance to
1,this movie makes it seem like a joke
1,almost everyone involved in the making of this movie is either mentally ill or the first person on the way
1,alan smithee a genius for this one has a talent in this mess of a film
1,there are so long drawn out and the characters in
1,equipped with the most ridiculous and clich i have found the plot to be a very funny one to watch
1,actually if i had an option and it would n't make any serious sense i would have had an allout laugh
1,it 's a real shame to watch this film to make the viewer feel the need for a sequel by that time and the only
1,it 's the type of thing you 've probably read a lot
1,this film was a great movie
1,see a movie where you can almost make movies about how it is
1,so if you 're in a coma and want you to watch the film without thinking its not a bad movie you should
1,it is a film with all my heart
1,but this time it 's not even close
1,i had a few chuckles on the movie and the movie is about a guy who is a teenager who has a crush
1,to be honest the story line was not bad
1,i think the director should have stayed away
1,in all fairness this movie fails completely for a change but for
1,ending is a bit of gore with a good cast and
1,but this time the movie is really about the same guy 's wife or the
1,i saw this movie many months prior to
1,i have watched a few of her movies i think i 've seen all others as well
1,how did the creators know that this might not be the same as their
1,editing was not bad as well although there was no point for the plot
1,which i suppose is n't as funny since
1,the omega man' is an excellent movie and the movie shows a great deal that can be missed by all
1,i do n't know what else to like about this guy
1,there was the usual action and a bit of a lot of the characters who were trying to stop the zombies
1,but that 's what makes this movie unique yet the film is too long for its own good
1,it 's not the story of a man who was dying with a vengeance with his
1,however it is a great movie
1,the film is an excellent example
1,i really liked this film but this was the best movie
1,the story was so poor you could drive the film through a string of gaps and throw away at the end
1,i ca least think of a better movie for its own sake
1,director brian yuzna 's debut has been a hit of the highest and is certainly worth watching
1,exceptional acting by a cast of unknowns
1,to say it all is that bad
1,i was impressed that they were so bad and i am ashamed of them when it comes to tv
1,but if you 're interested to see how a woman can go through
1,firsttime cinematographer george ford who directed some of the great noir movies of the late 20th century was one fine in many respects
1,gosh this movie was not bad
1,not a great movie but for some reason
1,alas in fact a bunch are made up
1,she seems like a total moron for a child but she can
1,kurt russel as the lead actor is excellent
1,but it is a real shame because that is
1,try not to be confused with the plot
1,while this is certainly true to his work the film is just plain awful with poor performances
1,aided by a superb supporting cast this film is a must see
1,a few seconds later he gets a second wife of
1,lubitsch and the rest the director could have been a great star for all this
1,or do you have a great time for your kids or people who want to get
1,all of the actors are pretty good and a very good script
1,and there was no need it to make a sequel
1,though the film was n't really worth the time it took to it 's time spent it 's time in the end
1,but for instance there is a great deal of humor here
1,when i read this comment i thought that the actors was great and the actors did a good enough work that had me smiling
1,i have n't seen this movie in my life so i decided i 'd seen it for quite as awhile
1,tom selleck is as the villain who is a bit of a jerk who seems to have the best of his time
1,it 's not that bad not
1,it is a movie that 's really bad
1,personally i would give the whole movie a 7
1,the movie was a joke and the acting seemed pretty flat
1,but then again i would never watch this film
1,it 's all about the plot
1,i 've never seen one movie that has a good plot and this one lacks in my opinion
1,ron livingston as always is great
1,it is also a bit difficult for me to imagine how
1,it has absolutely nothing going on it 's the right direction and the way the movie
1,i have seen the original film and this is the best of all
1,to get back into this mess would be a good idea for someone involved in the production and crew of this turkey
1,interviews with the film and the music
1,he is in for a short period of time and he is still the best in his role
1,a group of people who are trapped on their own in an urban world find the treasure they find themselves isolated
1,at one time the director does not know what to expect
1,starring william wyler who is a very talented actor but i think he was the very high point of this movie
1,perhaps they could have had this film more in the theaters if it could
1,that 's why i liked it
1,unfortunately this is not the case with the book
1,if this is all a film you will get to the end of it
1,given the choice to find a film that makes this one one that is n't even worth watching
1,over all it is a great movie and it is the kind of thing they do to preserve your friends
1,my only problem is the acting
1,a little more than a bit of a mystery the story of a bunch is
1,the acting is not bad not that great
1,nurse betty is a movie of a true story
1,by my opinion i did a good time to check things off
1,this movie is so much more entertaining than the typical suspects
1,in a very realistic way the character of john is the most believable and most of the characters
1,conner is a real person in the film
1,the first was a film with a very similar and story
1,he is not even in one film the film portrays the very real nature of his career the film
1,however despite the fact it was the most popular film i 've ever had
1,this movie has nothing at first to offer
1,where is his signature of the same old
1,that being the case with the show i think that it would be
1,such a film could never have made sense
1,this was a real stinker and it
1,but the best one in this series
1,also the scenes when the girls try
1,why did i keep getting bored with the movie so i was very entertained
1,this is one of my personal favorites
1,val kilmer is great as the villain his friend is really great as the evil sheriff
1,i saw it tonight and it was the highlight of a movie i had watched
1,in one scene i felt a little sympathy in this movie
1,mel gibson and his brother are in a class
1,it is a bit slow and too long to go to film noir
1,the only redeeming feature was when the director
1,this movie is a waste over and
1,it does n't matter that much to me this is a very beautiful movie
1,do n't forget the music the dancing and the fact that you could do so much
1,this film is just a piece of garbage
1,oh i did n't see the film till
1,i think the film makers did a good work to create characters that were well
1,look the part of a woman with love interest
1,practically the entire film takes place in a house where it is filmed a lot of times
1,for all the movie goers who can appreciate any good acting by their friends and the
1,some of these actors have not been able to get away on a single dimensional note but they still manage to create some very effective performances in the form
1,to my surprise it is a movie that is supposed and makes you sad it has so far
1,he 's also a good choice for him though
1,in one way i loved the scene at a party
1,robin redgrave was in the first season in the trilogy
1,in fact i think it 's a shame that the series has been cancelled so far
1,i am surprised that it actually got released from theaters or dvd
1,i think that there is a reason why the whole film has a
1,with a little romance there 's the occasional chase between the two and the end
1,i do n't understand what this film is doing but this movie
1,laura linney 's role is so good that it 's like a real stretch of the story
1,this is not even a good example
1,the movie is a true masterpiece for those with nothing in their collection that should be in a hurry and the movie was very much a success for me and i did n't want to spend time on the
1,the film does n't work as an exploration of the life of the characters in the book
1,the plot of the movie is that there is
1,all of the scenes are quite well done
1,there 's a lot of action to keep us interested
1,i have to say that this film is the most interesting
1,as such and that the story line is not all a mile
1,gunfights are done with lots of people and the effects of them are not quite as good
1,displays a great cast a fine cast
1,and the ending is a little slow
1,well this is a film that should stick to the book of a young lady who should n't
1,i have to confess what the film does to it
1,the director of the piece with her daughter mary was a little of his most successful
1,sean bean in an attempt fails miserably he makes
1,to sum this up this is a very bad movie it 's pretty poor
1,yes it is a little predictable but it really is worth an
1,i just wanted to watch this movie again after seeing the original
1,the only thing that keeps going to waste are the ones with his shirt and the girl is a little over the head of a car
1,i am not sure i am not an artist but if the
1,enemies of the lost ark and the other two sisters try
1,the only redeeming features were the cast which they made for the film
1,lame story that really could have been interesting as i would have liked to see
1,like this movie this is a very moving one
1,the whole thing is really really stupid
1,to add a few extra points
1,a real shame since there is no real plot
1,this movie is not a good film
1,it 's not all the best movies in the world and
1,none of the characters are funny the plot lacks
1,there is plenty to love this movie
1,there 's some sort of a plot twist here
1,it 's an amazing film that should stick to a wide range and hopefully we would give it an extra season
1,from the opening scenes of the movie and then the credits roll down the line and then they go and talk with the music in the first 10 minutes
1,after seeing the film the viewer is shocked that it 's only a very short time on the film
1,not only does the film deliver the required amount of fun the
1,eleanor taylor is a real joy and a little less than i would call the role that was in the old lady
1,errol morris is the perfect villain for the whole role
1,mandy lane is absolutely beautiful and she
1,however the film 's script has a somewhat underdeveloped plot
1,we have to believe he has n't been able to save his life and it 's not even the easiest he will
1,at first we are introduced as not to see it in such places
1,eric stoltz is a great actor but he does a good role as mr and his son is
1,the first movie and that was the worst
1,three stars out there as well in a film
1,it 's a pity that the film fails to deliver
1,the story is simple enough to be interesting
1,so what do they do here and not have a
1,and the plot the plot to which the characters
1,i had to watch the movie twice and never saw it coming
1,i am sorry to say that the acting is good for a low budget bmovie but the production design and cinematography give an awful impression of what is going on
1,it 's just too bad the story is n't even remotely engaging
1,eventually the movie ends and that 's the end of
1,not a single instance of the dialogue was very good
1,this film had been made to entertain the
1,the film makes little impact when the director is trying it to
1,why is n't it that the movie does n't involve the real thing
1,a few years later the man who has the most important part is the one who comes closest to the death of his mother
1,the director 's idea of a killer whale is as good as
1,my son says that it has some interesting aspects that are just plain hilarious and i am amazed and amused
1,amber 's performance in this film was a little hard with the movie
1,in other scenes a group members take refuge for no apparent reason
1,ok it is just a good movie but it 's not even the best in
1,oh i remember about a year later he is still a singer
1,this is a very dark film
1,i was really looking forward to this movie
1,several times i have to wonder whether the
1,the acting was good the script was great the directing was very good the editing was excellent
1,not only do they make it easy to sympathize with the young woman and
1,most of my friends have been told this movie is a masterpiece
1,vic morrow is one big man who gets a lot of screen charisma and a fine supporting performance in this
1,one of the worst movies i have seen
1,the only thing that makes the whole thing watchable is what you have in this film
1,this is just a poor attempt at humour and a serious lack as an actor
1,it 's a good film by any means that it
1,the script is good the acting is pretty good the actors are good the script keeps my interest and while i was impressed at the thought that there was nothing wrong with this film i could have done a good film
1,if they had n't made an awful movie in a long long list it would 've turned them on to a more interesting film
1,rated pg the ending of it is absolutely
1,more important is that the director chose to get a little repetitious
1,in any way the production values are the best
1,like so many other movies this series is not about the evils or story of the main
1,add to that that the characters and the cast members are just bad and they are good
1,it 's hard as an action film but the execution of the
1,there have not really been one redeeming feature since and that is why
1,she meets her friend a young woman who is not only one
1,the film is n't too bad as is what the film is about
1,the only way to get this film was the soundtrack
1,madge barkin and richard crenna are two great singers
1,this one is just so good to be taken seriously so i
1,a group of four young people travel into the woods to find out who 's the killer
1,no one in this movie really has ever been a great actress nor is this film
1,i do not want my kids to know it was that bad after a while and this movie has got to have me on the edge
1,cheap and predictable but there is also a good deal of violence throughout
1,this film has a great cast including
1,maybe that 's the point here but it
1,if anyone has any reservations of this sort of work please please do not make this
1,the story is very simple but with a few twists that make you laugh your butt off
1,for instance there really were n't a lot about her in the film
1,both the script and the actors were very good and the actors were well done by all involved
1,is this just how to do it is so much more of an effort
1,i 've seen a lot of movies but these are not
1,all i can think about is this movie is a remake of what it was
1,unfortunately for those of who have n't seen the original
1,anne heche plays the woman in this movie she is a brilliant
1,otherwise the movie is worth a watch for all of you
1,the music is good and is pretty cool too but
1,the script was n't really that bad though i did n't like the character of the original story so much as to be the main theme of this movie that it
1,can we please believe this film has a
1,let me repeat by the comments on this one of the worst movies i 'd ever seen i will
1,this movie has a lot of fun but this movie is just
1,i am not the only movie with that type from the entire cast
1,the acting is not that bad though
1,i do not know about the director
1,he was a bit too quiet on this one
1,well that is a real reason and a few more
1,as it turns out this was a bad
1,the film also contains an odd premise of the supernatural and
1,you 'll never be able to see how people who have to deal with them and who were all the same in real life
1,disappointed i have n't seen any of the other movies and have
1,naming an attractive guy on a remote road and his unborn wife is a very good
1,in fact he 's still a good actor and that is a shame because he was n't a real man either
1,yet it is all about the family who is trying out a lot of drugs and drugs
1,harriet was the first to die and i saw the ending of a very good one but the film just did nothing for
1,playing in a movie theater is really
1,the story is simple the characters are interesting the acting is excellent the cinematography stunning with the exception of the actors and the music by george gershwin and the wonderful visuals
1,it 's like that you 're sitting next to
1,eager to make a few comments to the people
1,it was just another film about the life crisis or even the love that was going through with
1,and in fact it was a great movie because the plot line was so weak it was not even
1,as for the movie it is well put together and has some of those in the way that will
1,while it does have a very weak ending it really does n't feel like it was filmed at home and that it had been edited to be taken out
1,but this is not an excellent movie that i would recommend
1,in addition to the lack any of the other films there is n't one redeeming character in
1,the first part of it in which he plays a guy who takes a trip from the dead was not his fault of
1,is not the film 's director
1,this movie has everything you can think a movie with no real good acting or great acting from
1,less than a few seconds of the first hour of
1,after a string and the subsequent alarms are pulled off they have a very very different feel to them
1,i had to leave that theater
1,angelina allen is a perfect combination and the director and producer are both good and good
1,immediately she goes to a doctor to see him but also the first one and he becomes obsessed
1,one of those things you can do was not the same way that you did
1,they both seem to like the characters so well and the characters that you care about her from one moment or another
1,the main characters are in fact a rather annoying psychopath and he is a very annoying young actor who is really a good actor
1,for example the scene is when the guy gets into the club at which he has a crush on a
1,the whole film is a dream
1,but the film 's director is more than a year before we get a feeling that there is no real point to the story which is n't a good thing
1,no wonder it 's not a sequel to the original
1,she is as the daughter of a rich family
1,this is not just a film
1,christine and her mother are on the verge for the best
1,whether or not they were the best of
1,while it 's not particularly great in the least bit the film moves
1,the story is based upon a true event
1,the only redeeming factor i would have liked to was was that it seemed to be about one guy 's life
1,i 've just laughed at a few moments in a while i do n't even think they 're in the movie
1,timon ford is very good as the tough guy to play a character with a good voice
1,what was up the door of the first disc
1,sincere in that it 's a pretty good story but as it stands there are some of a lot to the movie
1,2 this time the director 's name
1,that 's why the movie is such an
1,while watching the film is just a great piece of cinema
1,she had the talent to have the most convincing scene and she was very believable
1,why did n't he not have to
1,and as the two fall victim to love
1,calvin who was not only the son but
1,just as i was expecting the film to go back and watch
1,falon 's life has become apparent but there is nothing wrong with
1,lee van patten is great here the acting is excellent the writing are
1,michael pare does his job with good acting performances and is so believable as to have
1,in one scene he says that he will take the camera and give him another
1,after all they are a bit stiff
1,if they were in this film the film could have been a better idea in the first five
1,i do n't have high hopes about this film since it is a low budget b low low rated b movie
1,if there 's one thing that bothered me that way i could not stop laughing at a film that i was not
1,robin williams plays a very creepy young woman who wants
1,fun for everyone interested with them
1,my friend and i are searching for a great story line and the good
1,regardless of its flaws i think it is a great little film but the performances do n't really gel
1,out of the blue it takes place
1,she does not seem the other way but the film is full of clichs
1,maybe we will get to see a bunch that was pretty good if they 'd get a chance on it
1,the movie is also very slow boring at times and i felt bored watching these
1,be forewarned that it could be a good idea
1,the only reason we 're interested in our culture are that the filmmakers do
1,it 's just about a guy who 's the head girl in his car to be reunited with an elderly girl
1,the story has been told a bit before and the fact it is n't only a comedy but a good example of it
1,it 's not that i think it is
1,i ca all believe this movie was a good idea
1,the actors were all excellent as it was filmed and acted in the
1,in this instance we see how much time spent in the past
1,the ending is really good and the movie is a good one
1,this film really captures what the world has to offer the audience into
1,being the only way to find the world and to understand what the people
1,on a scale of 1 the acting is ok but it 's just a bit too
1,many people do a good acting too
1,sometimes the people who made this movie
1,fortunately they are so stupid and so utterly ridiculous that the viewer is left with a blank smile
1,then the camera zooms away on screen and there 's a big gap in the
1,supposedly the plot could have been better had it not been for the good acting
1,i am a fan of musicals and movies and this one has that
1,if not for the fact that the movie was shot by a friend of the same caliber who has seen it you may not
1,truly it 's a waste of money
1,i 've seen it several dozen years ago and i thought it would be good
1,but he never did n't make an appearance for himself
1,at the beginning of their rope a few months after the events happened and
1,i think this was a really good movie that
1,because they 're in a coma and the one thing he sees in this film is the old man who was shot in the head
1,sounds like a bunch and then in some ways it 's not worth the celluloid that it 's getting
1,it 's an insult to many people
1,personally i'm surprised that this show never happened on the bbc television series
1,more like another thing i could n't resist watching it
1,sadly it is very funny in a sobadit correct
1,chow is a good guy and a lot of fun
1,it 's one thing that should have ended a great
1,the only thing that i could say
1,in fact the film is about a man named sam a man who lives in london during a christmas eve and is forced to choose with himself after the end of his journey
1,it is about time a week that is told with the most famous in this film and it
1,he is a very nice guy but not as bad as
1,here 's what you get for the plot
1,the only thing about this movie that i wanted was a marginally unusual and interesting ending
1,during the war on iraq the president who went into the war to assassinate the germans and the germans who were
1,his first meeting with the devil has to have left him permanently and eventually becomes a target for everyone
1,never mind the fact they 're supposed to be and who they 're like
1,both the actors are uniformly fine
1,their character is n't very believable as in some of the other films
1,i have not read any other reviews
1,i do not remember seeing this movie because my sister is in
1,detective jake is one hell of an interesting and interesting film that is still good
1,at least one of them has a decent time line
1,enjoyed it and then it 's one that makes it a great movie but
1,this was the first time that a sequel
1,it is an insult because it is
1,in the meantime it 's not very clear how they are trying to create and create a great atmosphere which is a bit of an accomplishment to me
1,it 's one that the most beautiful of
1,to me it 's like watching paint drying a bit too much
1,really bad movie in which you actually see that in an effort for a good movie
1,the script is not as good and the director as the
1,for me and my wife i did it
1,when i rented this movie i felt like that is what the movie was about
1,it 's all very well done and it
1,there 's nothing wrong in a horror movie
1,director james fargo has managed all that the story to create a movie
1,i'm not going to be so bored
1,promising but then the film is filled full of
1,and then there 's a bunch the actors of it all
1,but that 's all he has to offer and that he is a master
1,the film begins with an excellent opening sequence where we see a glimpse at a dark society of events and then the aftermath to the extent
1,when i saw the film i was a little sceptical
1,things get worse when he 's in a van wood film where we meet his friend and his cronies in their quest to save the day of this disaster from the clutches of a couple of the girls who are now known to the new generation
1,truly the best animated film i can remember from that
1,and why is the movie so good the whole premise seems to go nowhere fast to get a bit more attention
1,upon seeing the film i can only assume that the makers did n't think the audience would have been interested in
1,actually this is one that can be a complete waste for the whole movie i think that is
1,that 's what makes the show so successful and interesting
1,you have to look at your heartstrings if only to realize it is an old movie so you have to be a huge fan of horror films and to appreciate them
1,yes there are lots of good movies but this too is very very bad and has nothing
1,i do agree that this is a pretty funny movie for its genre but it
1,the movie is pretty good but i do n't think it is really good at all
1,the only reason i watched this film was that it is just that a movie
1,it is a story that you know that is in
1,most of all i really really enjoyed the movie and did give it some extra points of view
1,it has the feel to it 's predecessors and
1,they were both excellent actors and had great chemistry
1,angels will come along with them as an example of their own
1,not even for me but if you 're really bored and think about it this will be a great movie to
1,trex is the only good thing that can i say to this movie
1,if you want to read the book do not read the manga
1,highly enjoyable to be seen to believe but it definitely does get worse but
1,but for me one of the most important aspects of the film was how it
1,similar plot for some interesting moments
1,there 's also a very good scene in his life when he 's running around the countryside
1,with a better cast and a stronger plot it would 've been more interesting and original
1,if they were going for a little more insight to the issues they did n't
1,xxx is just what most of these films
1,but that 's what i found very disappointing in the end
1,this is a movie that you could
1,often i found myself in hysterics after seeing that the story
1,the first and third of the series deals to the point that i was not aware about the original
1,now the film is set in a new mexico building in the middle east in the early 1980s and the 40s in a small village
1,particularly the scene of the man who was actually playing the music in the movie was quite effective
1,the ending was also quite good
1,in the end it is too much the kind to be a little over a hour
1,example of this film 's budget is it 's not really quite as good as the first one but it 's just plain stupid and it 's
1,this is one of the films i would
1,action packed well done for a good story
1,i would like to mention that the whole point in this movie had no point the entire movie was about
1,to me it is the worst film i 've ever heard of him
1,when i watch this i have to say it was great
1,the plot of one of those who are not a big child is a bad boy who 's a guy from a different
1,naturally there 's no real plot
1,the music is great the score is perfect and it helps make a good movie with a message which works so well
1,in short this is one of those films
1,he is one of those rare movies where they are a complete idiot
1,boring movie from the beginning to end
1,our hero is a young man who goes on a rampage
1,there was no story and that 's not to say that the acting was terrible and i had never been able to sit through the whole thing
1,and if there is one thing to be good for that film
1,being so excited i decided that i would watch the show again on a friday night and
1,in this film the characters were not caricatures
1,i had a blast with this movie which was n't bad and i would
1,the main characters is in the movie but the director is so unlikable that he 's
1,and the best part was the one i was looking for in my mouth when it looked like it had a very fake budget
1,the only redeeming qualities about this movie are the very high production value that the movie is set up
1,the film seems a little too bland and the acting is not that bad
1,or that was the case in the movie where it seemed to be the movie for the whole purpose of making fun of
1,there 's so little that i can tell you what you 're supposed so hard you wo n't
1,on a personal note the story is interesting
1,when it comes out on video i can imagine the producers were making a film on the market that it was shot in black
1,alice 's boyfriend is the perfect choice in the family life
1,for the record the viewer was treated to such as well
1,i 've watched it a million years ago and am still glad i had
1,the acting is good and the characters and story were quite
1,while the plot revolves a little on a bit too much i expected more from it and if the
1,to be fair there is n't a very good story as such but it is very clear that the film really
1,richard lester and michael jackson are just fine as they do
1,steiger gives a fine performance but the movie does not have any of its qualities
1,this film is an absolutely awful experience about an annoying family trying at the end
1,there 's no reason for these writers for the actors to act like i was on the screen and
1,could 've been a decent film if a
1,the movie is not only the first hour and it
1,dr loomis has to rank at the top 100 but the film is pretty boring
1,by all means a very funny movie and you can definitely relate it to a bunch of old folks
1,i do understand that it is a long film but the plot is so real it makes it
1,my only regret is that there are scenes of people walking through some of the
1,the story of a girl who moves through gunpoint and kills him is a real stinker
1,before the film 's title there were no big names like bruce lee i 'd say
1,this has the same effect as the aforementioned
1,c thomas was an awesome and versatile actor
1,either i should have expected an episode or
1,he 's a bit too eager to make any of her films
1,90 percent minutes of our hearts are wasted in this film i was
1,the only reason i did not give the film a score that was to
1,when there were so many other things that made him interesting i felt it would have done
1,even the most ludicrous film ever has the presence of a woman in the film
1,keep at the edge of your chair
1,and he 's never been a favorite part for many
1,it was a waste of talent and money
1,but for anyone who does see how this movie was made i 'd say that i 'd say the acting is superb in any case
1,my advise if you really want to see this movie watch the tv series
1,anyway in the next part he meets a beautiful woman named christine who also tells him of his childhood life and has
1,in the meantime we have a movie that makes it a little confusing to watch but does n't
1,finally when the movie is over and is just a
1,to the end he 's really just about to be taken from it
1,there 's also a bit of humor and
1,flavia is the only reason we can give in to the whole thing
1,of course it 's the fact that the only one who did the right thing in this series was a little girl
1,the film is quite well made and directed
1,laura linney has a small part as she is and
1,buttermaker 's direction is a mixed up
1,so this movie is one of those films that i really wanted to love but i was disappointed
1,because he 's a big name actor but i would love to see a film made more than i would have expected and the story of a
1,this show has been in many ways the simpsons and
1,the acting is poor and the film was boring
1,however i ca only imagine a problem with the actors and
1,i was really surprised by the story for
1,jimmy fallon as a reporter is very likable
1,the only problem with that was the lack of a decent story
1,john cusack as the sheriff who finds himself embroiled is one that
1,it 's not even a very bad movie at all and it 's too bad that this series has been
1,he 's the leader of an american family in the family of the president
1,five out of ten because the story is good and the plot twists are
1,this film is not about the subject matter of which the film is a masterpiece
1,i'm sure that the film would be a better idea to make a sequel of this classic but the director and writer had to be made
1,this is a film that is n't worth renting
1,this is the kind that makes us a little more and better we
1,most of them are as bad
1,the story is n't about how the two friends who try to solve
1,instead of getting into a film i would
1,there was no shortage here i do n't understand why they 're so bad
1,and the fact is that all is explained and all the action in the movie is just as exciting
1,if i want to say more of anything the other was the good one it 's still not worth the time to sit through
1,now i'm not going for the most interesting
1,special effects a bit of nudity and gore
1,the ending in the end makes you feel like a voyeur the movie itself is just a little too long
1,it is a real treat and the film makes me angry it will be my cup of time i do n't think
1,even a movie like the texas chain of the old adage was made
1,shelly 's character has a secret admirer in order to survive that he is a bit too much for the role
1,the only positive about the film was its plot
1,aside from the first few minutes of this film there was a lot more to it than you can shake on the wall
1,i am sure you wo might be glad you took it
1,lipsync is a good example of how a story about a young man 's life on the brink of
1,the only problem that i have with the movie was that it was so bad that it was laughable to watch and it made up a whole hour or more of my
1,oh my i 've watched a lot worse movies in
1,i was able at some of these people to see that they should
1,it was the story line of the book of the novel which is so bad that it 's almost impossible to explain how
1,the story is about a group of teenagers a bunch and a bunch of
1,but then the movie takes a turn as a film
1,i was very impressed as well and i must say that i had the flu button of being a fan of the comics i was expecting from
1,on a technical note it is very hard at the beginning of the film when the two boys are
1,the script is not bad but it was n't enough for me to sit through
1,i would have liked to have made a better film
1,his father is an extremely rich businessman
1,whiz man of course the film has a few redeeming qualities but it is n't the
1,i just found it very very funny and i really thought it would get worse
1,when a movie like the legend is being made i would go on a journey to the
1,when the two women have to take on their roles they decide to take a detour on their own life and take their own place
1,i saw the first part and this was the only good
1,so what is up with that
1,deadly grannies that are n't supposed to get
1,the story is set up for an interesting and satisfying climax but is not a drama in that department
1,unfortunately i do recommend this to anyone looking
1,good enough it 's just a shame
1,for the record i saw this movie at a preview screening as a comedy
1,yet i would n't go away at all because i 'd heard that
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't give the ending away so that the viewers will realize that
1,the director has no idea how things are going on with it
1,the acting in this one must be good if that was n't enough
1,the script is a great one and the performances are excellent with the exception of the actor
1,get some friends off the street and they
1,tasty little girl with a hair of hair
1,yes it 's true that the film
1,after watching this movie and having read that it was one the tv show i saw i
1,it 's all pretty predictable and the story itself is rather weak the acting is wooden the story is boring and is n't
1,naturally the movie is not for the whole lot
1,one of our best comedies is that we are watching a
1,the film is an example a director 's work that fails to make much impact for anyone with whom it
1,one of the few things that i thought was was the soundtrack was one big exclamation of the movie 's score
1,and he was a young man
1,anyone who has seen the movie will agree that the original is a good movie with a
1,spoilers alert this film is a classic
1,this movie is so good it is not funny and it is so funny
1,just to see the whole thing in that context
1,two words for the audience who are only in this film
1,count dracula is about a girl who is a teenager who goes to a house for her mother
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,again i think it 's a pretty damn accurate film and has great acting by some great actors and i have to admit i was
1,after having watched the film i felt i must have seen it for my childhood
1,if you 're looking to get a chance to see this movie i promise that you will enjoy it
1,there 's plenty of action in the movie and there are lots and lots of explosions explosions the fighting scenes are so cool
1,yada and behold the story is full of holes
1,hattie mcdaniel 's performance is quite good but she does n't come across the material in her acting as the villain 's character so the film
1,this is the story that made it even scarier
1,i was impressed to see this as a movie
1,the ending is very surprising and leaves you thinking
1,410 is a pretty good movie i think it would help
1,the ending is the best part of this film
1,heston is an actress on the verge of womanhood the film is as an art
1,at least she does n't get to wear a
1,i have just bought a copy and watched the entire movie
1,when you can read the book by david bradley i was not convinced that it would have made
1,his character is not so likable but his role and his acting is so great i ca n't help but think that he was n't so
1,boogie palace is a very entertaining film with a very good cast
1,it 's a very enjoyable moment and a very good one at that
1,look no other i 've been impressed with this film
1,we 're all over her and she 's just a bit too smart to have a good reason
1,caught in a sneak pile of dirt and a very young couple who got involved in the making up a few weeks
1,it is like an insult it 's a shame because the film is
1,the whole movie is pretty predictable and very uninteresting and the acting just plain horrible
1,so why does they have to make such garbage and this is the most stupid thing
1,i was expecting a much more accurate film
1,today the plot revolves around the adventures of the two main characters
1,but this show is a bit of a bore as well
1,soderbergh 's direction was the biggest plus
1,donald moffat is a real hero and he is
1,rage is one thing that is a complete disaster
1,it was just like trying desperately to be funny
1,they all seem to be a very strong place to get
1,as you might have heard a man being killed by a car accident on his hands
1,i was shocked to see her in this sequel and the film 's eventual influence on the characters of the
1,watching this movie is quite an accomplishment to watch
1,i had heard that this was made in the late forties
1,a very nice and very enjoyable drama that was really great to watch
1,not only does this have a rather dull
1,the movie was so bad that when you put it all away to give it a bad story and i really did it
1,i could n't understand how this movie would get even funnier
1,two people are sent out to investigate a crime in a secluded apartment where they are invited down a small river by a local sheriff who tries so
1,currently that 's what we get in the movie
1,this is an awful awful movie
1,neither the action nor the suspense are too long
1,the acting and directing are awful at best
1,having seen it a few times i can remember a lot from the actors
1,i 've watched it countless times
1,watching the show in my first class was a good idea for
1,i think i 'll get to see a more serious film like this
1,otherwise it was the perfect movie
1,but the real thing here are the performances
1,this is what made the movie so great it 's not a great performance at all but it 's
1,i have just wasted the last remaining time with me so i cannot get into the real world
1,the music score was so very bad
1,i 've seen thousands of movies that are so awful it was a little
1,cgi in a world war two the bad guys are just as bad as the first half and it is
1,this is one of those films that 's a
1,i saw this when it first came on tv at the local theater
1,i have n't had a movie watching this movie before but i think it is the
1,mike jones is a great actor and the rest of the cast were ok but not enough for me
1,overall do n't waste time or money
1,and i mean if you have a crush or you ca n't find a cure it 's a
1,the acting is excellent the plot is interesting but it 's not a bad thing
1,count dracula is a pretty good actor
1,you 'll be glad you 're watching the right
1,yeti also appears in the film
1,the script in the end is a bit too long
1,they are very talented but they are
1,however it was so easy to tell
1,that 's what we see about the first two episodes
1,for me it is a film of a kind for those of us that will not want to get involved in seeing that a film can be so great that i am
1,the actors of that particular movie had to have
1,three years later the local and of the group of friends will soon be on a boat and it has its own a very bad thing in it
1,throughout their stay in their place they are just
1,like many other reviewers mentioned on imdb i saw this movie at least once the first 20 minutes
1,and it was one of a handful of things that
1,the story was a bit too confusing for the writer 's and cinematographer 's to keep
1,i think that 's why i give this film the benefit of it as a whole the whole movie has a great premise for a thriller
1,it 's the same type of character in her own way
1,i am sorry but if i can forgive the director 's vision of this movie
1,i am very surprised to see her take the movie and not make a film
1,and it was a pretty good idea
1,its not even so much a movie a real film and it is a very good movie
1,the only one who can act is
1,at least that scene had me wondering what was it for the film and that 's how much the movie makers
1,as the story moves along we get to see him tackle his life as the main character
1,there was a lot of potential in making this story
1,as for the music and the scene i will say that if i were in my room for the last ten minutes
1,i do n't know what i have a problem in the world of war films but in the future it
1,this is not a movie about the world 's greatest triumph
1,but this was n't one of those i did not expect to see a lot better
1,in fact it is so boring it 's impossible to believe that this is a real stinker and the
1,i am a fan of the show and i do have a good time finding a way in which they 're so good and to watch in
1,this film has a great story but it 's not too bad it 's almost a little too
1,cant imagine the exact same thing as the first time
1,the movie is quite short but that 's enough of a great deal and lots to make you jump out
1,miss piggy is so charming and perfect
1,did i mention that when he went mad
1,one of the best movies of the year 2000 with the great actor and a brilliant cast the film goes to a lot
1,the acting is horrible in this film but the script is n't so bad that the audience does n't have any interest whatsoever and then they
1,there are also some pretty gruesome scenes like when
1,i could n't figure it out
1,it 's not a bad performance
1,possibly the best movie of all time
1,come with you a bit of a plot but it
1,unfortunately he just wants to find a better man than to get to know the
1,very interesting but not the greatest of any
1,they are at an equal level of escapism that the film makers have to offer
1,the only thing that could possibly get me more
1,the characters in this movie seem as
1,the first time we saw it it would have gotten a lot more screen writers and directors
1,any attempt at humor is simply annoying in
1,it was n't as much fun as a film or
1,every time he gets his kicks he 's a good guy
1,an interesting concept about the dangers of a woman who 's being told her father is born in a time where she is not so much a male and has a son
1,you know that this movie is a joke and not worth it but the fact that this
1,his father is a little boy in the town who 's always not so good
1,dan don baker is a man with some weird issues but does it just have to take them all and make them
1,would you believe you know the real meaning
1,what do you think this is
1,the acting from the entire cast is awful as are all actors
1,but it also gives it a little bit more suspense and a little bit of humor
1,it was the first time a film was made
1,the story is very simple and is very engaging
1,and in the beginning that we have to
1,the movie was just so horrible
1,che is not a complete pawn
1,his character is the best and at any points in the film he does n't do justice in a movie that just gets better with each
1,the main premise of this movie is the most intriguing
1,the plot was simple yet so i was a child i was in the past 30 years of the movie
1,do not be fooled by the acting
1,there 's no suspense no suspense and no thrills
1,captain and jury are a lot more
1,i was not expecting much from this movie at first i found this movie very interesting and thought
1,after seeing the film i thought what
1,whats the case here on the shelf
1,the film is set during the war scenes where the action takes place on a small ship and the film looks so poorly
1,gyllenhaal was also great as the father but is never really explained
1,then we get a lot of fun going and a bit less of a plot but it does deliver some
1,i do not know where this film was going
1,as it stands there is a lot of people who have seen this and i 've only seen that in their own way it has more
1,even when the movie begins i was very impressed
1,richard farnsworth is good in his role as the villain
1,in one scene the police ambush them and then the camera pans down and we see him
1,vlad is the most successful character that has ever been in this film in the movie it shows us the human side the character of the young son of
1,the whole idea about the world has been changed by a corrupt family that is n't really
1,during the course of his life the film loses its focus on how to deal
1,i was expecting a big surprise
1,i do like the fact that this film is only 84 mins shorter as it has all the elements of a
1,that 's what you think and do n't say it 's not that bad in its first ten mins
1,but the film is also very good for the time period
1,he plays a nice man who finds himself transported back to his family to protect
1,moog would make this movie a great success
1,this movie is one of the most overrated movies of all
1,hitchcock does his job here he also shows a very moving portrait of how we are made a film with no less of a good story
1,from the first moment you see the movie the whole family is on a journey to make a trip out that there 's nothing more than a bunch
1,henry fonda plays a likable man at his own best with
1,i was hoping for this movie if the ending had been too sappy
1,ellen burstyn is a real pleasure to see
1,he was an actor he looked like he had a long career ahead to the time
1,the movie does not do that with some
1,anthony quinn is a good actor and is the only way around for him when his character is so funny
1,hitchcock 's vision of the film has a very powerful and unsettling look in it that
1,carmen was a bit of both in the end and that she would not do in the movie but in this movie she
1,i do n't think the filmmakers intended to be objective to make a movie
1,by the time it was the end of the movie that
1,i ca only think this is a film that 's worth a watch
1,each time i see the film again it is quite good that 's the only point of view
1,hey it was just a bad movie but it 's definitely the better
1,it is just a great movie and worth owning for a couple hours or something
1,they are the worst actors in hollywood
1,movies are all about the real human condition
1,first of all let 's see the original and not the same
1,i ca n't believe this movie could ever get made in the 80 another
1,the story begins with an unexpected sequence with a young man with
1,the movie is a good family movie and you have a
1,it was a waste of time but for everyone else this is definitely the funniest of any
1,i have heard about a lot of things before i saw this
1,even more than a few hours later it gets a little boring towards the end but it 's a great story that
1,like a few others have the audacity of a good script
1,that the film is about a young man named kurtz is an excellent film
1,also a nice film that features a lot of the scenes which
1,this may just not be the worst
1,it 's not just a movie where you have to watch the film in the context of the film to
1,favorite film i have seen it 's a shame it is n't in the imdb bottom line
1,sophie christensen is a very convincing heroine
1,this movie is a mustsee for fans who
1,sometimes the movie has a very strong plot and has no relevance whatsoever to a story which goes
1,as for the music this film has a few scenes of it being filmed in the
1,the first one i liked the story is the character 's development
1,actually the movie is a complete mess
1,the plot is quite simple and the acting performances are all pretty weak but the actors are all great
1,i do have an egregious fascination with the
1,although there may have some potential to be a lot better and the film 's plot twists are
1,furthermore this is not a movie and a complete waste
1,the director of this film was a director for the first time
1,throughout it would not even be as good and i 'd have preferred it to be a good film for those interested in the genre
1,marino is a pretty funny but somewhat
1,i am not a big fan like that
1,so the film is an action film
1,however in this movie there are few reasons to have
1,again they are the best in the world and the most believable and unique aspect in the
1,there 's a scene where a couple friends sit outside the house with
1,i do feel sad for the poor boy that the
1,the story is very similar and it does n't matter that the director has to explain all the issues and questions that go into place
1,not a horrible movie to watch
1,they were all in denial but it was all for naught to be funny
1,or in a case of a crime
1,it was a shame he did not get the chance of being able to do something more than a few of
1,what was the point with the film
1,i had a headache when i got the chance that it could only be so bad
1,for a few minutes and a half minute it is worth a look at the end
1,it is a shame to hear him sing his songs
1,i have no idea why this movie was made
1,one night a stranger has a very difficult job with the woman that killed her
1,this movie really was bad and not at all impressed and not enough was put into it
1,does he look like he is doing his best to make this film
1,malkovich 's performance also as a somewhat eccentric character is very interesting
1,maybe i can see this movie again and again as a comedy that
1,despite this film as a whole i must confess i have always found some more amusing ones like the last few films that are better then the original the most dangerous but they were n't
1,the script does contain a few scenes of a decent film
1,he is not one of a man of many films but he does n't know how to create an emotion for the audience or the audience or is the audience
1,the film 's premise revolves around the young daughter of a man who was accused by her father and her father
1,his wife is a doctor and has a son named amanda who has lost her life
1,why would this film go for this one and that it was shot in the first 15 minutes
1,first of all i am a fan that is so old to play rpg games but this one really did n't work
1,in a series of events in the plot of the two warring characters that
1,if this were a film then i would have been surprised how bad it was
1,okay if you like movies and action
1,fulci 's the howling is so bad that it 's almost funny at all but even so
1,it does n't make you happy and that is just because it is too violent to live
1,if they had had their child then they would have left out the plot
1,in fact the film is very good
1,i have to say to anyone there i am in my opinion a little bias
1,i just found out it was an american movie with many of the cast members and i do not
1,but it is not worth much
1,however when i saw the trailer on the dvd cover i was not surprised when the movie had been made
1,at some point it was the same way you had it all figured
1,he does the job he 's made and that 's why his films are just too long at
1,one of my favorite shows and one of my favorites
1,what made me want the movie to do
1,but when it came out on video in
1,this is n't exactly a good movie
1,the plot is a bit weak
1,hallmark does n't have to be one
1,the actors all act in such a manner that is so
1,yeah yeah the ending was a bit of a letdown in my opinion
1,the first part was great though the movie was very boring
1,i was a little disappointed to see the original but i did see the film on a vhs copy
1,the acting was good and the story itself is pretty accurate
1,this is a great film with great acting by
1,before you begin to watch this you will find yourself laughing hysterically
1,i really wanted a second chance of seeing what it was
1,the movie is a mess of sorts from
1,worthless and bad acting is the only thing
1,barbra is still a good girl because this film has no redeeming qualities
1,the first scene of this movie is pretty much the same as an old man who wants to kill himself
1,as you can see he was a great actor and should have made a lot more effort if he were in
1,despite the good reviews i found it quite enjoyable as a whole the acting was okay with all sorts that could have saved the movie
1,sadly the movie is so good at its core it 's a mustsee movie to those of you who ca n't stand it
1,i'm amazed that the director did n't have the
1,not only that the movie is an entertaining little piece about the struggle for the past
1,the whole movie is shot in the head and the actors have no talent other then that of the same actors
1,i have n't seen the original yet but it 's a great film and i recommend you to
1,you ca look at it in the end of a film like that
1,the only real highlight is why this guy
1,when the story is n't bad we are forced to suspend a lot of things
1,my favorite scene is where our two guys are going to get a pair of guys out there
1,performances are ok but you do n't get to see
1,the first half hour of this film is what makes a movie watchable
1,from the opening sequence where the hero of the film asks her to come home at one point and another is in his position she finds solace in her
1,john wayne is a talented actor but it 's the story about his life
1,he should have been more interested more in the character development and development
1,of course the movie is set to a very simple one
1,the plot is n't very original
1,producer robert deniro plays a former cop caught in the dark by the british government as a ruthless cia agent
1,its the most disgusting part i 've ever seen in my entire life
1,it 's all just a cheap excuse of a script
1,however it is not that i did n't expect much from the movie to me because the
1,the movie had a lot of problems with the main characters but there were no real
1,this movie makes the movie a lot
1,you can do that with your own eyes
1,at the end i did n't care for any of these people but they were
1,warning spoilers you see in a different way
1,upon learning the name is a giant spider
1,so i think that you 've been in a good place
1,scream the same goes for my copy as i would n't watch this film
1,if you 're looking for something more than this you 're in for more fun to watch then you 've already seen the first film the
1,the acting was n't the least bit overdone
1,the acting was good but not bad
1,peter o'toole gives an outstanding portrayal of a character and the film is well made and well acted
1,and i mean that the movie just got worse
1,there 's only one thing and the acting is very good
1,also the fact is this is the same old show that the director did so
1,the only reason i gave any given was because the plot had the makings of the usual
1,everyone involved in the movie is not bad and i 've seen
1,there are a few redeeming factors to this movie
1,secondly if you have n't read some of the other reviewers who have read that
1,yes a bunch of kids who have a big laugh and two children go down their throats
1,this is another example of how bad the movie really was and that was the only reason for
1,he is a talented actor but the rest of the cast does an incredible role as a doctor who is a
1,the plot revolves around an alien man who kills his wife and daughter who has been married to a woman who happens to be
1,if you want a nice film about a bunch i 'd advise the original
1,i have heard that there was a film of this sort
1,there 's the girl the mother of the woman in an earlier
1,if you like this movie do n't see this movie
1,they just are trying the same old time but then things become a bit more obvious in every way
1,overall the script was pretty good although i do n't think the writer did any harm
1,in fact if you want a good laugh go for it a very good way to pass out the action and watch it
1,as for those who have already read the first movie it is the
1,perhaps the film 's producers were trying to be hip and failed to make a difference
1,the only thing i could not give this movie a 7 is that the entire
1,part of a serious issue is that he does get into the war with one of the gang members and their leader who has
1,the first film was a lot better than the first and i really enjoyed his performance
1,it 's not that she 's just another annoying person with no chance for this and
1,we have the exact best actress you have ever heard of her as well
1,the acting performances are all top quality and the writing are flawless
1,does anybody know who killed the woman and who has it
1,on the plus side the actors look like they were trying too hard to save some of their roles
1,kathy bates is the perfect fit for all the major players who have n't played her role better before
1,so if you 're not just bored and want
1,also the plot is very original and well executed
1,the movie 's story is quite compelling but the direction and script
1,never do you hear anything that is a movie that you will never ever understand but it 's not a complete waste of time
1,star wars clone trek v of stargate 2
1,2 this is what i would call a horror film
1,cut it up and i 'll give it a 7
1,walsh has a great supporting performance as the evil prince of
1,now in the end they just are n't going
1,when it is n't a film it 's not funny
1,johnny weissmuller as the father of a famous stage star
1,to the extent the writers of this production were able not to make a movie
1,courtney and a man that was n't trying too were very good
1,and as with any other film she 's very very talented
1,get a hold to the video rental
1,a woman and her boyfriend have to go to a house to get the gold 's fortune to live
1,in fact the only reason i can see this film was because it was a film that was released at mgm a couple of years ago on
1,also we have the two main characters whom in
1,hopefully we can forgive the movie industry
1,a movie to have you and your family to see the world
1,originally on the dvd it was clear to see that they had spent an extended budget on such a bad movie and decided it might have made
1,les mariachi is a highly recommended film that shows us what can be like
1,this movie is n't even worth renting unless you 're a fan of the original
1,i 've never seen a film like this
1,as with all of these movies i had the privilege and hope that this was not a real stinker and it would be one of the first movies i would put on my own i can see
1,anyway this is a movie that could n't have been done anywhere but it 's not
1,julie delpy is an excellent choice
1,in my view she 's a beautiful and sassy character as the mother
1,the story is pretty much what all movie fans can possibly understand
1,the script was bad even the actors were not particularly memorable
1,how many times do you go to think this guy has a mental breakdown
1,even then i was surprised by the movie
1,before the movie was over the acting is horrible
1,and it 's not that a film with the exact
1,dumbed up the camera work is very tight on its grainy steadicam
1,i think most of the people who are in this film and are
1,it 's not a bad movie but if you want something different to make fun of you
1,after this we 're introduced to the story of three of us who get caught up with a very unusual idea and then get into the mystery of the lives of both the two and the same as the first in the series
1,i'm sorry but i was disappointed i decided that i had to be in the
1,the only reason i watched this film would for me is
1,it was so awful and so unfunny that there was nothing to complain about and it made
1,as i saw this was a film that made me a fan
1,at no point did i get my adolescence i did not like that
1,and the music is n't that great
1,the acting is bad all around
1,its not a movie with a lot of sex scenes the gore
1,kathleen turner plays her role in another great movie which is n't only a very good performance
1,when a bunch was on a mission the film is so poorly written that i
1,the only other comment i have heard on imdb about this is it 's the same person as this
1,not even the acting of the characters was believable and i thought the script of the original and the main plot was a complete rip off
1,granted there is n't much else to say it 's no surprise that this is the worst movie i 'd ever see the acting was good
1,just as you might expect a few people who are looking for the lost empire in the village and in the end do it in a way that will
1,harpo and his team are trying to get rid of the family and get a new home they can find
1,essentially a good cast with a good performance and good actors could n't act better
1,i'm not even thinking about the fact that these movies make me want to be a little more impressed
1,there 's a whole slew of the characters and the actors and the actors do n't do well in the story
1,disney has produced the best film in my whole lives and is one of the best
1,usually in the same vein that 's a minor problem in this case the movie is
1,probably in the middle of this movie
1,to the point where the story is not entirely true to
1,cgi was also used in the original series and the same one
1,a few other films have a few redeeming
1,and the acting was so poor
1,i saw this film as part one of a friend of mine
1,it seems very clear that it is a real life
1,a lot happens in real life
1,the main characters have the worst of the best and the script by joel schumacher is absolutely perfect
1,katherine hepburn has the best role of her life as she tries desperately
1,when she finally gets in the middle she gets a bit of what he can do when he finds out what his best
1,if you have n't seen it you 'll have to be the most to enjoy this film if not for the acting by
1,my only real gripe is that the story line and
1,a few moments of dialogue to show up
1,and then there is the ending with his girl and dad the mother with the same guy who has a crush on his wife 's sister
1,a few minutes of my youth i will be as
1,an hour and 34 for the series
1,tom and beth are a little better than the movie that was
1,stockwell has his character 's appearance of course and one ca n't wait to
1,with an interesting ending this movie fails even with its own shortcomings
1,granted the acting is good but the script is so poor that it makes for a laugh riot
1,no wonder i rented it because it had been so bad and
1,sure they 're not all that attractive but i 've seen a lot worse
1,i could n't even find what was going to be funny or amusing to laugh
1,additional of all the films this one has seen from
1,if i had to watch this movie i would n't be disappointed even with that
1,i have to confess that if you 're a fan 's will see it in the theater
1,the acting is awful from the main cast
1,i am not a fan of these type of plots
1,dennis o'keefe plays the lead man in his early and early career and does
1,and if you 've only watched the last 20 minutes of this film you do
1,when she gets married she tells her mother that he can
1,if he does that he is still in love with one man and one is to be taken away from his work
1,if you have just watched the movie you would n't know that
1,it is an excellent movie and i recommend it not only for it 's own good acting and great
1,durante 's story with his wife is a good idea
1,after the first half of it you 're hooked to a bad movie
1,the whole point of the game was that it did nothing but tie it with the whole one of them
1,anyone else has been a fan of the original or is that it 's worth noting if
1,how could anyone who can get their hands on this one
1,i saw this film at the rotterdam
1,karin is in for a surprise
1,robert englund is great in his role but this is a pretty poor adaption from a different character than the two
1,not that the director did not warn the director of the movie or the other way to the director who knew the story in this story
1,then he becomes a victim of the film
1,now the only good aspect of this film is that the cast
1,justin timberlake plays a young man who is forced in this prison to be released
1,and in the end i was surprised to see how the movie had to turn out very well to be a good
1,sadly there are a number that was not a lot better then the rest
1,the acting is poor and there is no chemistry whatsoever
1,it 's like he is trying to do this with some kind new material that is n't really
1,even when i heard this i could n't take the rating seriously
1,basically this is a good movie to be watched if only one about 84 minutes of your day yours would have been spent on
1,him are the main problems and he has a rather large problem with them and he tries
1,gene roddenberry 's score is very good too
1,rhoda has a few scenes in the movie and the actors in this movie are very good
1,utilizing a good story and great acting and the characters involved in
1,just as a story it 's really about people who are trying to get them to explore the reality in society
1,the only reason i even saw this movie was that she was a good looking lady
1,the movie itself was about a young boy in new orleans a year
1,this film has a lot to say
1,that said i was impressed with this story
1,this is a real treat for a film maker who wants to make a documentary of the real life of a wealthy man who loves her
1,it is like the same movie to show us
1,there is n't even a good performance to it
1,then there are some things that are funny for me
1,my favorite part of most movies the night
1,it 's not a very clever movie but it is definitely a movie about some kind of love
1,in fact i did n't see it as a serious
1,hope davis gets to play the role of the
1,there is an element and many other minor things about his character 's ability to make it clear that he can identify with his family
1,i think a bit of the latter 's part of the film is just too much like the characters they were given
1,the director did n't want them in such a serious way
1,this is a film that is not
1,she and her boyfriend are also not as good looking as you can expect they would
1,every other scene is an example
1,with these guys the girls are going to get a little over their heads
1,this movie was n't a lot
1,i have read several comments on this forum and i do not
1,it is also the same movie that has a great story and it 's not a comedy
1,if the film is n't bad enough the killer snowman was a complete ripoff of a friday the 13th movie
1,but then he meets up with his friends and gets involved by an imaginary mother
1,so the movie is an absolute bore
1,in a nutshell the film is about a group of
1,he has to use the camera and look at the camera
1,diana rigg is great and she is perfect for the part
1,the first half of it and all that is left was a very
1,besides a bit of comedy in this movie it
1,i really enjoyed this movie and i do
1,the director who knows he is a talented filmmaker and is the director of the book
1,i am not so sure how it 's gonna
1,the film is very well constructed and
1,some of its elements have been quite funny
1,mr blandings 's character is a bit of fun
1,ill it was a good idea to go to the movies where this movie was supposed so bad that it was almost as boring
1,if it sounds real it should have won the oscar
1,you can read the book and do yourself for the book
1,hotel rooms for the big screen in the late 70s and early 40s as the title suggests it 's not the best movie of all times
1,treasured for a very long time but this film does n't work because they are n't afraid that it will be a bit slow at the beginning because the entire film is so slow that you are not able to see the whole family
1,of course the director does n't realize that the director is in it for that he has n't done anything about the film
1,however it is still a little too far
1,key to the plot and the film 's premise of a woman who is engaged for her family is very
1,i do not think that this film was made by anyone
1,then they realize that they have been poisoned and killed while
1,just like all of these movies in
1,if a person is looking for a laugh then i doubt that this movie was intended to go beyond all else
1,i was really impressed by the movie and that was how i felt after watching this film that it was worth watching if
1,i have a crush on this film but the most glaring thing i can
1,i have to say this is the best movie i 've ever played
1,but it still managed not only the
1,basically this movie was very boring and was a waste story for the first half the film seemed like a joke that did a better job
1,if you 're in a mood to be a fan or want something like this one
1,i do n't recall the first time i saw this
1,well i suppose i'm a big star wars but this movie is not for
1,even though the movie was made by a low budget director the film is still pretty good
1,jerry o'connell was a great choice in this
1,at first i thought they was in the military
1,this film has some funny scenes with a few laughs
1,and that 's how i feel sorry
1,teams up and down the mountain is very hard to
1,we also see him having that look at himself in his early years
1,this is one of those films that i had seen in a while in which it was shot and shot
1,intensely i was a fan to know that the movie was a comedy as the whole movie has a great
1,this movie does little for me as if it was n't
1,if your looking to see another movie like the one from which you see the first half and do n't waste any
1,they 're very funny and it 's fun to observe them in such a silly situation
1,good luck of course to the director
1,but if you 're expecting a movie like this to be
1,a woman of the west who is a woman 's father a mother and a father and a loving woman
1,some of the acting in some of the supporting actors is pretty good
1,next time she comes out of this scene a woman is killed and she goes through the motions and the movie goes downhill
1,mostly it has a lot of problems and a lot of the movie is shot at the time
1,around it 's a pretty good movie for a rainy sunday night
1,talented actors including john rhysdavies as a sheriff on the case who has been on the edge
1,flesh was n't what i expected it to
1,in addition the acting is superb in all aspects of their career
1,i do not recommend it to the people that are n't in prison and i do
1,it 's all so incredibly good
1,i was a fan of the original and saw this film at the sundance film festival and was pleasantly impressed by how it was
1,why on a camera would n't even have allowed him to have to go out
1,yet the plot is just as thin
1,it 's like a student movie
1,feet off the screen for the entire hour and a 10
1,it seems like a director with an iq of the
