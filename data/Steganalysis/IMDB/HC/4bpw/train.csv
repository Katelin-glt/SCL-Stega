0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,what is this supposed to say,what the hell is this film about
1,what 's even funnier is how the director managed to inject some real life into the characters,what is most striking is why the filmmakers have chosen to make these kinds of movies

1,the first half of this movie is a real treat to me and this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen,the only other film in which this was made for me was when the story was being told from a technical perspective in what would
1,as a result though it is an insult to the intelligence for that matter because i 've just seen some of the scenes that take them into,as soon as the plot kicks into the film the characters seem more human than most of their films and there is n't really a point
1,angelina jolie does a decent job as the wife and i,angelina jolie and michael jayston should be ashamed of this

1,and i have to admit i ca n't remember that movie with,and that would be the best reason to watch this crap
1,the main character has the worst possible of any of the four main characters as he 's in the book,the ending of this movie will probably leave you wanting to be a part in a new movie but it will

1,an hour and fifteen seconds of pure tedium it 's just too silly at times to,an excellent cast led from the leads who were the real star of the film
1,although the movie is good and in parts it is not bad,although the movie could not really have had a story of this sort
1,thus is the movie that has nothing new but a little more for it to be made in the us or even,thus we have a great ensemble of actors but this film is not in the same ballpark as you would think
1,i ca only see that many of the movies i 've mentioned this far from the others,i ca only assume he 's a fan of hers but this one takes more of his character
1,and i have n't had the pleasure on this film before,and i really wanted to see it because it was so bad
1,it takes all the elements and it is quite a surprise to see,it 's hard for anyone who is not familiar with the movie
1,and this is what makes this movie so unique to me that i am so impressed with the plot line you feel for you,and the acting and editing is so good that you ca ca n't believe that someone else could do something that 's the least interesting
1,it was the most expensive of the,it 's not all a movie
1,the plot is pretty stupid and the acting is really all over the place as,the script has to rely on the ridiculous plot lines to develop an atmosphere
1,all the actors did a very good in this movie,all in all it 's the best film i ever seen
1,but that 's what the movie is like,but i guess we have an awful plot that
1,the film also features a lot of plot twists and the usual clichs,the film is not for all tastes but also in one way or so
1,and the acting by all concerned,and he seems to be a coward
1,james coburn 's performance is perfect the character of the young,james earl jones' the most successful character in the film
1,after his girlfriend and the husband of the two daughters decide to spend their money the weekend,after a while it 's clear that the real actors was just reading this off cue
1,it is the best one i 've ever seen in a horror picture and it makes you feel,it is n't even a story about how they were all and how they were all in the family
1,and the movie did n't really start as such,and the ending i will just love it
1,her character is so sweet that you could feel her pain towards her,her friend is a beautiful woman who is a man who wants revenge and
1,they are the best to be in the movie,they 're pretty lame but the acting is pretty decent
1,the film is very long and very choppy but it makes you wonder how that got to work,the movie has a good mix between it and the story is pretty good but the acting was terrible
1,after the sunset he is arrested by the government after having witnessed him for a month,after the opening battle scenes we witness the various sides of the ship and how this movie
1,just in the end a very funny film that you 'll never have seen before in,just because the main character is a woman is not a very bad idea about the movie
1,i saw this movie in my local theater and had never forgotten it about 22 years ago,i have read several comments on imdb that say that this has a great cast of actors
1,movie mavens should not miss this one,movie mavens to recognize who they are doing
1,because i like the way the film is so funny and the music sounds so great,because i'm afraid that the movie was released in a time that i thought it was the
1,several people seem to be enjoying the film a lot,several of the actors are great and the actors are good
1,however this film was not only the worst,however the whole plot is just boring
1,it is a very well made documentary,it 's a very good film with many
1,i 've always been one that makes me cry and have the opportunity to watch something with a fresh face,i have to agree with the previous comment here that i have n't laughed a few times and will always be
1,i have n't seen any movie like it and it seems like something similar to the one in the book is one,i do not know what to call a film like this but it certainly is good in it 's purest form
1,this is one film that i 'd love to watch and to laugh out loud,this movie is the worst horror movie i have had the misfortune of watching
1,i do n't want to talk on the ending and i,i had to give it a 1 out of 10
1,there 's so many plot twists that you ca ca n't even get to the plot to figure,there is a certain amount of time to develop in the storyline with the character and story
1,he has n't yet learned about the world and his love of the man,he was also a lot of fun to see but that 's not saying it
1,i saw this movie at a sneak preview screening as,i 've never seen such a complete waste together
1,the movie starts on an interesting journey from a somewhat bleak view that it has its share and is very effective and very touching,the only good points are the ones with the main character 's mother and the fact she was the only person who was the main
1,we follow the two leads with the story of the boy and their relationship between them as they grow up and take up residence,we do get a few more glimpses of what we get when we watch him and we feel the pain of his death
1,mitchum 's performance is so wooden that he is the only redeeming,mitchum 's role here is very funny but that 's it
1,if you do n't think you 're going to see this movie you 're not missing anything but i think you should have seen it before,if you do n't have the right choice of seeing a movie that should be a classic it is highly recommend it to all ages it 's
1,that was a bit too much for it,that does however be the case with most of
1,while this is n't what it is and is a true classic,while the story is rather interesting it seems that the screenwriters had decided
1,paying for some kind to pay attention to the story for a few minutes or so,paying attention and then when he meets his wife we find out the truth about the death
1,there is some very cool and interesting parts in that one but it,there are many things where you do have to say the director
1,also the only funny thing was the fact it had a little more depth but,also the only one of this is the one which is the real star
1,being a great fan that 's the only person who,being his first two films he is a genius
1,in fact they have a nice body,in fact if that 's what we 're
1,it was not so bad that it 's even worse,it is an example of a truly wonderful and hilarious film
1,the only redeeming feature of it is its title,the characters in general are very interesting and believable
1,but the film is also really a,but the movie does n't work
1,a bit later we discover a character from the past and the two,a good story line with a great actor and a fine ensemble
1,peter o'toole played by a young anthony hopkins is a welcome touch in the film which leads to a fine and interesting performance by anthony perkins who,peter falk played the part of the main character in a very short and interesting film which has always had some redeeming features for both actors
1,this is by far one best movie,this is a pretty funny movie that was
1,there is the whole film about the same person in the same,there is n't a whole lot to like about this movie
1,the first thing we know is the acting of the characters and the actors,the story involves a group of people led to believe that the only two people
1,one of the most original films ever made in a million years and it has,one of those movies i really enjoyed and it was one of my favorites
1,all the women of the neighborhood are very funny especially as they do with their children,all i could think is that this film is a real movie of the kind they would
1,in one scene she goes on a rampage as she 's walking on her,in a nutshell you ca n't help noticing the similarities of these movies
1,one night when the movie is over we can only see it for the sake of,one of his biggest disappointments and his movies are very different from the other films
1,les enfants del toro is a very talented actor,les niro and his men are all fine
1,and that is one of its many weaknesses to show it 's not that great it 's not an allout,and when her character does n't seem to get to her acting her she is pretty much a woman
1,much for this movie a character study is introduced very well and it makes it hard as well,much of the movie revolves on the main plot but it is not as bad or bad at the
1,filmed by the cinematographer steven lumet with an almost nonexistent script he seems unable the production values were low for a feature length film,filmed with the intention that they would be on the right hand to see it in the theaters it 's still very good for the
1,i was surprised at what a bad guy it was,i do not think he 's just a bad actor as
1,i love the character but in fact it is a bit too difficult to,i could n't take it anymore but i did enjoy a good idea
1,american graffiti has a great performance and a strong cast which is always good to see and that includes the great barbara stanwyck as,american graffiti had to come from an excellent filmmaker and it could have done a lot more than it 's a perfect tribute
1,the whole thing looks ridiculous and does n't have much to offer but the way it 's,the only reason i did not give the movie a 1 are because of the plot
1,as a matter of fact the director could have taken him out of,as soon i saw this film i was stunned at first time
1,so i watched this film and it was so bad,so it 's no surprise to have this film
1,the music is pretty damn great to the movie,the story was that great and the acting was ok
1,different to that i 've never seen,different strokes from the original play
1,example the movie as it could be said and done on the big screen,example it 's a pretty funny and entertaining story about a guy named satan
1,blackadder 's attempt was good but he just was not,blackadder is a great fighter and a womanizer who is not
1,dan 's friends who get him into their bedroom and they are trying to save the,dan akroyd is a talented actor of the type and his performance is also good
1,the story of the movie is so bad that its good and i thought the story was good enough to entertain,the only thing that keeps me watching was the fact that the film just does a better job explaining why
1,the only reason it got a 1 is because it never happened,the main idea in a nutshell about the first movie to the big
1,one could n't have been more wrong of the,one of my favorite movies of all time
1,in fact she is more or less like a barbie and even though she appears she is not as convincing as her,in the original a movie called it this is the first that was made in 1972 but they do just that
1,having been a fan of a few of,having seen his work i was able
1,seven out is an hour and thirty,seven out of ten stars is worth watching
1,and there 's even a great deal,and the whole idea of this
1,so what we 're told is a pretty simple story of a man discovering a young,so much is put on the dvd cover i saw it on the big screen
1,but the film has a lot of good stuff too,but i was n't expecting to see him play the part
1,it is the sort of movie where it seems to make absolutely nothing,it is a movie about how people are in the same situation
1,with all i can think of is this a movie about the evils and feelings of the war that occurred during the war era,with the exception of the last fifteen mins you 're not sure what it is a lot of things are going on but then why
1,yes she says and he 's the one,yes it 's a nice little film
1,this film has a certain charm and it does a great performance,this movie just makes it worse than it should but it does nothing
1,blockbuster for the rest of us the,blockbuster was a low quality movie
1,i do not understand why they chose him to create a film about the war,i would recommend this movie if it is to the point of buying it
1,few films i liked the most because they are n't so bad and that they can be just a little more enjoyable than this movie,few people can relate to the fact the director attended her or her family because that is how it 's about her son in law
1,it also has a lot of action and action scenes,it 's a shame why it is so funny
1,not to say the story line was interesting but also very interesting and very realistic,not to mention that the entire production of this movie is just plain stupid
1,i have watched it three or five years after my childhood and that is why i watched,i would not go for this movie but it 's really a bad film to me
1,it 's all about the acting but the,it 's not really a bad remake
1,shah rukh was excellent but still it,shah rukh is one fine movie
1,the story is a great mix,the only way that we can get
1,john carpenter 's music score is a marvel above the rest of the film but it,john ritter does an excellent performance as the villain in which he gets on screen
1,if this is supposed like this you do n't expect it,if this is a bad film it does have something to do
1,i do n't care if these people are supposed to have the rights to their future that this movie can be made,i was expecting a movie from a lot less but i was just not a good fan and i just felt bad for
1,if you 're interested with the story of a young girl named luchino and she is n't the same person you,if i could n't get to see this movie i would have been more impressed with my friends at least
1,a lot like this movie is an,a little later in his career
1,these scenes were n't enough to save,these are not all you want
1,the acting is ok the script has,the plot is not very interesting
1,followed by some scenes which are the most annoying i 've seen in the past few minutes,followed as such the plot is the worst i all have ever seen and far too many of
1,i ca all about how snipe 's character and his motivations,i 've never heard such an interesting and thoughtprovoking portrayal
1,at the end he is a young man with whom we learn from the mistakes that he learned in the end when he was the son,at least we 're still able to identify to the screen but as the movie progresses we 're told to leave the viewer for some confusion as
1,i had no idea that this was going nowhere,i do have a fondness on how they 're going
1,part of a lot of movies like the others of this series,part of me giggle and cheered so fast that i just could n't
1,the only positive thing about the film is the fact it was supposed to be a comedy,the ending was too obvious and the story line was too preachy for a sequel to this one
1,he 's supposed as though that was one thing to make it a bit of a joke,he 's just not in the same mode when he has a chance to kill people
1,his character is so much better than he appears in every character 's character and it just does the job he has to overcome,his character was just stupid the only one who was so irritating in the first two parts was the one who had a bad time
1,the ending is the most memorable one of the movie,the only thing i found interesting about this production are what
1,the acting and script are absolutely fantastic and i love the way you look,the story of the movie is simple and it is n't very clear
1,initially the film is shot beautifully on tv as they interact to the most important thing in the universe,initially i would rather watch my instincts as a viewer than the last person who wrote this book
1,it is the fact that he 's so annoying to the point of being so ridiculously funny that it 's hard enough,it is n't a bad movie but it really gets me interested in the story so i 'll give it the lowest possible
1,well you might find the movie more enjoyable as i would suggest to watch a couple of times when i 've been waiting for an old movie to come out,well it 's so sad and sad it is a real shame that this movie did a lot of things but that is a problem with this movie because if you
1,in my opinion the best part of the film was the scene where the two boys are running over the grass,in fact it is a film that has a lot more to offer than the other one has it is
1,there is only a little nudity or nudity to make it good and it has the potential to,there is no story the characters and the relationships between the characters is really flat and predictable
1,i have been wanting to give to a friend with my,i do recommend the book for the movie to read
1,but the film 's direction is very very good too,but i still ca ca n't get my money out of
1,things go awry with the main characters,things like this are not in this film
1,unless the actors in the film wanted they should be allowed into a movie and it was very good,unless you do not have the option to be able at the end of the day this film is a
1,as usual as it was a complete waste over 200 hours,as far has been concerned this movie had a great deal of
1,in fact it is n't as powerful and as exciting,in short though they 're good actors as their characters are
1,demon and the vampire slayer also was a really awesome movie,demon and aliens do n't do this for a very long time
1,i ca n't help feel that i have a fondness with the film because i,i would give this a zero out 10 and that 's what i think
1,very well done but not very good,very funny and a great movie
1,crawford 's role was very good,crawford 's performance is the most powerful
1,gary cooper plays an undercover officer but the film does a fine job of keeping his,gary oldman looks suitably bored in this movie as is his role as the villain
1,a couple of scenes in the movie were funny to me,a couple of times when i think the show was n't really
1,october la bam is n't a film it does n't look as funny as its predecessors and it certainly is a bit of a letdown,october 11 1992 there were some wonderful songs and i have not heard them since i was in a film that 's a great combination of
1,he just does n't come into a good idea to do anything interesting or interesting,he had a knack it was because it was the best thing to show the whole
1,i have to assume the director did n't have,i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,derek jacobi is excellent as a man who gets to see this guy and a young woman in a bar,derek is not a great villain to play the part as a character he does not show his true love for
1,but this film really made the movie worthwhile,but i really liked the first two
1,both were good at this but there is a scene where the hero of the family tries not only as a child but rather a psychological outcast that makes us feel as if,both have a similar role to play the characters who are in this film or they should have had a bigger time frame which would make one of the most interesting characters
1,i have read several of the comments,i really ca all be wrong
1,if you want a good action movie do something better,if it were n't for the fact that you just had
1,not to mention the movie is a comedy,not for those who have read about the age
1,need for a few laughs to be made in the first place,need not apply to this film as one has a few more rewrites
1,contrary to that film 's a film with a plot twist that 's not as good as the original but still is the most disappointing thing i 've read in this film,contrary to that one of the most important parts in the movie is the part where the mother 's grandmother and sister have no trouble finding the woman who has lost his mind
1,there 's an obvious lack of explanation of the situation,there would be a lot better on the subject
1,heck this is not the case,heck if i had to pick the
1,my favourite characters are a bunch who is not just a bunch of friends,my first question is who would ever say that in the book there was no
1,this is one of her more accessible roles but this,this movie had to be one the biggest disappointments
1,his portrayal of the world is not so much different as in that era that the film is based entirely on a true story,his only character is that he 's not only an everyman but also a mentally unstable man that wants her to get a life
1,have they done so much since the late '80s,have i even heard a good word at this
1,when it comes it is the best movie that i have ever seen and i have n't seen one more movies by a man who has ever,when that 's the only way a movie can be seen and the only film that can make it to the theaters is the best one
1,on my list this is a good film and it 's a good show,on the flip the movie is just so much fun and the music that it
1,this is by far one of his more famous movies and that is saying something,this movie is not to be missed is the same old time we 're used as
1,in my opinion it is the only thing,in this case they are quite funny
1,perhaps it may have made a difference between it but it 's also a little weak and the overall feeling of the film has,perhaps this movie will make you wonder who will really die and if you have already watched the movie you will get more
1,without the action the film could n't have ended without the ending left a little bit to be desired and it may seem odd but if,without spoiling it for anyone who has watched any of the other movie and i can assure you why you should not watch this movie
1,this is a movie that never lets go rewarded,this is a great movie about a group of men
1,this is the kind of movie that you would have trouble finding,this is a film that you have the rare experience of
1,the story follows a group in the town in the south of arkansas with a new york city,the story itself revolves on two young lovers trying for a different experience and a group of students from
1,why do they call in this movie,why could the film be so successful so
1,this is a movie that is full,this is one of my favorites
1,he has the ability to play the part,he 's the best part in it
1,woeful movie about how to go into the house,woeful plot that is so unbelievable you wo ca only
1,my wife who watched a movie and did it,my only problem however are these types of scenes
1,you can tell it was a good idea but,you 'll feel very sorry for the guy
1,belafonte has a very small role in a good role as the,belafonte also stars in this film as well as joe mantegna
1,as for a bit of the movie 's overall effect of a,as a film it is a very beautiful and wonderful movie
1,it is a movie that i think was one of my favorites,it 's a pretty good movie i do not have anything against the
1,okay the story is interesting enough,okay it 's like an extended version
1,however the acting was n't really bad but it was n't enough to convince us,however this is one movie that should have been avoided at the box office
1,the only good one was when they had been on a flight,the story line was a little too thin for my taste
1,how can a movie that can have so many,how does the director make the first movie
1,why does this show have to rank on the bottom 100 for this year,why did they put it in this movie but the director chose to give it
1,the acting and directing are excellent and is the film that sets to perfection,the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and i recommend it to
1,the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the dialogue seems,the film is an utter waste of time money and money
1,their chemistry with each character is believable and it has been done in the same way over again over and through with,their lives were to get out of control and get rid of the family from which they live for their lives
1,its a good film and should be seen again,its like all of the actors did a better acting
1,despite having an extremely boring script in their performances of the,despite the acting by the actors the plot was terrible
1,i saw it in the last years of the,i 've never seen a more beautiful woman
1,every single member of the audience is laughing hysterically at the lack of time for his work of work,every time they move around the camera they see something like the wind which makes you feel like they could
1,after that it 's hard to imagine it would be a good idea for a movie,after watching i am convinced i 'd heard of it and have to admit the acting was
1,the plot is simple the dialogue was pretty weak the acting was awful but the acting was decent for me,the only problem with this film was that we all agreed that they were going to win a competition
1,who was the murderer for him,who 's responsible for her actions
1,beginning with her mom and daughter,beginning the story of a woman in
1,probably the worst i have seen in ages,probably the most interesting aspect of this movie is
1,first off it is a very weak and dull film,first i 'd like to see this film again
1,there are a few moments of this movie that are funny and i will say that the acting was ok but the story is weak to say the very few times during,there 's a great cast the characterisations and a plot of two men who have been living in their country and having to endure their dreams to overcome their own life
1,i was not impressed with this movie,i do have the problem with the way
1,i thought this was really a bad movie which was really boring but was n't that good either,i could never understand that so many people who are n't even interested are very well entertained
1,my favorite is the one where i have seen a lot,my recommendation and see my share of friends and myself in order
1,be sure to stay with the original as the,be it a comedy or a funny movie
1,i could tell my wife was n't that good,i have never seen any of the other characters being
1,the story itself was good enough but the acting,the script by george ford was a joke
1,she also does n't show the whole thing that her husband has,she is a wonderful actress as she 's a real charmer
1,i had never heard about a movie where i found it so much fun to watch,i did like the character development and his character but he has a small role
1,godzilla is a movie that you would see again,godzilla ii starts out with the evil man of a
1,however the acting and character development is so far off that you just ca n't help feeling like you 're supposed to laugh at every scene,however i do n't have much more to complain on except this is probably the best film that i have ever watched the film has a lot
1,that would have been if they had had made it to the beginning the film,that 's a little bit too hard to make and the story was interesting
1,i could n't care more how it went to get this film,i do hope it goes straight out on video and the next disc
1,if the movie is just a cheap excuse of a film or even an action picture it will undoubtedly satisfy some viewers who want the audience with more attention,if you think the film will appeal to all audiences of the 80 another and are interested in seeing the film this is definitely one to find out
1,give you all the money to take care at your life,give a good summary of the plot in the movie
1,well he does n't have to be the smartest of this man,well you have got to watch it to the next scene
1,i am a movie fan and that is,i do n't know where to begin
1,even the special features for this show are not the best,even with the poor script and directing the whole movie has nothing
1,because of how this is a comedy it 's a film that will give it a wider appeal to those,because i have never been the kind to go see the movie it 's not worth a look at
1,in this film the only possible character is the killer who 's responsible for the killings of his father,in this film it is not a matter as many as it is it 's a real good time capsule
1,soon after the war the bombing takes for granted but then the police finally become the last survivor who happens and is determined,soon i got to watch the movie which has some very good points in it that were so very difficult to follow
1,i have watched all of the episodes with the following two,i really hope that it would help if this was the second
1,every time a story was revealed i just needed to watch another movie and this one certainly has a great,every aspect of it makes you want to get out with the characters and to make it more fun
1,where is it even going to the,where is that in the first
1,if this was the best they could in making me watch it i would have been right,if you are going to watch any other columbo film the first one that takes us away is
1,dialogue is pretty lame but that is the case,dialogue has a plot of the movie that you do
1,it 's not as good as the,it 's not a bad idea
1,if you like bad acting bad writing and bad acting this one will be much better you have to see it,if it would not be that way i could say this and all the rest of her life i was looking for
1,the movie is also very good for,the characters are all well played
1,some scenes are just a little awkward,some may complain with the director or producer
1,this is a wonderful film that is the most fun of all its genre the adventures,this is an extremely funny movie that will leave much to be enjoyed and appreciated
1,jaguar mehta 's version on both counts as the best thing,jaguar khanna as a detective who is n't the hero
1,in some ways it makes this a fun film and if i ever find one movie i have seen i must be a little bit too thrilled i can say the first one is that funny a bit,in the end if you are going to watch a movie with good acting it 's worth the rent if you are not an atheist fan but as a whole it 's not as bad as you might find
1,but for some reason i still do not know who,but in my mind this film was really good
1,basinger looks absolutely ravishing as the villain who plays a character who is supposed at the,basinger 's character is not just a young girl a girl and a young one
1,i saw the movie on the video box and the reviews on how to describe,i do have some of the comments written by people on here who do
1,a few years after that i have seen all of them on the internet today and i still,a few years later she is the girl in the hospital in the beginning of the film
1,the only real drawback was the ending which left me wanting to read all of the comments because i was,the only good thing about the whole movie was the scene where the girls were trying for a baby
1,it 's not a great action film or a great drama but for a laugh it 's not even as good,it may sound like a big step down from the tv series but the story is more of a drama than a
1,thus if it were on cable television for free i would give the show a,thus in the film we do n't get a problem or a plot line
1,i could n't care more about anything about the movie whatsoever but that,i am in the minority and i will probably say to you
1,in fact it is n't even worth mentioning if you 're a fan,in any case you can see the film coming from another perspective
1,the film is also a documentary about,the film has no real plot
1,i do wish they had the courage that,i ca all imagine the whole film
1,the first thing you noticed that you can take it from me if i,the only real gripe is the lack it a story to the story
1,the characters in this are the very real events of this world,the script is n't great the story is just plain silly
1,the movie is really good for the first two reasons,the plot is n't very interesting although at least the plot
1,ironically it 's like a bad movie from the late 1960s,ironically there was a few good actors to go around
1,in fact the only reason to watch it is,in my opinion this is a great movie
1,the story is about a group trying so desperately to get a,the acting is awful but they are not terrible at all
1,i ca n't wait to see the next two episodes of the series on dvd,i am not a fan of this type of movie but this has no real life
1,but when the plot twists and turns it 's clear there is some great action,but the best part about a movie is that it 's a good thing
1,salvaging all other films of his own he will not disappoint the fans of the film,salvaging the first episode you will enjoy this one it 's just a fun game
1,i ca least recommend it to anybody who has ever,i think it is a movie that 's funny
1,this movie was made in 1990 when,this film was just as bad
1,codirector john cromwell directs an interesting thriller but it never gets to deliver any of the thrills of the book and there was some very,codirector william s burroughs and cinematographer paul r strayer do a good deal of exploring the events of the story of both of them
1,on the positive side the cinematography is good and some scenes,on the other hand it 's like a bad movie
1,i do n't know why anyone would like this movie,i ca to decipher whether that is just me a good
1,though the acting is very good there are some flaws from other films but that 's only the tip,though i think that the ending is a bit too long it is n't the kind of film where all
1,the acting is terrible but the whole cast is a bit over the top but still pretty damn good with this,the acting is so good the dialogue is bad and it 's not really worth mentioning the fact that it 's a
1,in fact in the end the movie is pretty awful even with the poor acting,in the end they are all so much fun to watch that you get to admire
1,undoubtedly the only person that thinks of him being able is a person who 's only on a mission to,undoubtedly the finest film of the year has made me laugh and i'm a big fan of ms allen
1,also if you really love this genre you ca,also there is some pretty creepy action sequences
1,later she 's the son who wants to help her find her way home,later there 's a couple of random moments but not as much as you might
1,however i did n't really care about what she was saying and that it was n't a complete loss,however the plot is n't very original or complex either to the plot or any of the twists or plot
1,this makes an appearance with this film and it 's a shame,this film had been released several years into the film and was considered
1,i have just seen it i do n't understand,i do not mean that i like it
1,mighty 'donnell has a bit of fun as the character he plays in the film,mighty is a man that was a little more popular than he ever got
1,it was just another bad bad move,it 's the same film as the original
1,uma kristofferson plays the hero a washedup reporter who lives his life in the united kingdom,uma farrow has a really funny cameo and plays a character that really is n't there for
1,the story is pretty decent but the ending was a bit too predictable,the movie is set up with the usual bad guy bad dude that makes
1,for one thing the main characters were actually quite engaging and,for anyone else the show does n't really have to
1,one has to wonder how the makers could have made another film out of a better film of the same title but this one was much less than entertaining and the story line was pretty awful the directing is poor the story is boring and uninteresting,one of my friends said i saw this movie for 2 hours and i was stunned at the sheer silliness it took to the extreme and in that sense i would not say that this movie is n't the worst movie i 've ever watched
1,however the film does n't work in my opinion,however i ca only think about this film as well
1,it 's hard on my nails so i guess what you,it was funny to hear people saying something like that
1,seth brundle is the only saving graces in the flick,seth macfarlane is a genius who could n't have been more
1,do you want to kill a child from the very time and place in,do n't be deceived by the comments on this page of a film
1,as an example it 's so incredibly bad that i can,as the main attraction is the characters are very realistic
1,i just have the feeling of watching a tv show that i had not seen so much of a tv show as,i had to sit through it in order of the first two to give it a try and i am afraid
1,he has never acted the entire film,he makes up the whole cast
1,this is a movie which would have been great,this movie could 've made a great movie
1,the plot and character work is so poor as in that of some people who are trying to make it to something meaningful,the first thing that struck me was that the movie seemed to be trying too hard at times but failed to deliver the scares
1,to be honest if i had never watched this movie a bunch would have been in,to give it a shot this is what you 're looking to see and hear
1,after reading the comment on what was a great movie for the first time on turner 's character,after a long time i was still laughing at how bad this was going a good way at the
1,the ending is an insult the rest is pretty bad and,the only other good thing about me was the music
1,the film is a classic film which features a cast of,the characters were all likable and the cast was excellent
1,then the main female character is played with a little more care and it shows her life,then you have the characters that are supposed to die and you ca all like them to have
1,this is by far the worst movie ever made,this is what the producers wanted to do in this
1,i saw this movie yesterday on a big night and i was,i have seen several other movies that are made for tv
1,the characters in this movie were absolutely ridiculous and i just could n't care more,the film 's plot was n't interesting enough to save this 'movie' but i was really
1,the director has no idea how to direct this movie to write,the story is so weak and unbelievable that you can actually laugh out
1,there are also some very interesting elements of it which include the fact they are,there 's something good about it and the ending and it 's quite good
1,this is a very good story,this film really has a very bad
1,however when the world is threatened to become materialistic by the way the characters are treated to the film 's success we,however i am a fan so i am delighted to say it was n't a good movie just a few things
1,if not the best ever but it is still quite good,if you 've read this you might like this but you may
1,it has an ensemble cast who should not have a clue of their careers,it has many funny moments and an amusing finale that was n't too well done
1,worse is the fact that some of,worse the worst in movie making
1,felix 's father has a son a woman and a father,felix is as good as ever to appear in a movie but
1,do n't be fooled by his earlier films,do not rent this film if anyone
1,i had been searching for his life of this movie for a few days now in his late teens,i ca n't understand this movie and that i will not forget it but i ca ca to recapture it
1,i had to rewind the dvd in order to see what they wanted and to be in the film,i saw the trailer for this film on the tv ads and saw it as a tv miniseries
1,so this is probably the best movie i have had the pleasure to sit back and watch,so we have one film to be seen with two different people in a lot of situations that
1,one could almost get out of a movie and this was a good film,one could not possibly compare the plot to the characters from the book and the
1,the acting is very good although there are plenty better actors than the actors,the story of the man who has to be the father 's son is the
1,it was n't really that bad after two of my favourites,it 's like one of the most stupid ones you might ever
1,the first thing that struck me though were they were trying at least it tried,the only saving grace in the entire movie is that it is a good movie about
1,the plot is very simple but you can not tell whether you really hate or die and are too aware of it,the only problem i had between the two leads was the fact we were supposed to be a bit uneasy and not even
1,it is as well written and directed and i think the best parts,it is n't a great movie but is one of the best
1,she has the strength of a good actress that i could identify with,she gets involved with the young man 's wife and they are given a
1,watch the original and you 'll agree,watch it again for yourself or just enjoy
1,there is no attempt at humor the,there 's a reason for that
1,i would suggest it for you to sit through the first one but if it is n't long before you give a toss to someone you have seen you will,i do n't mind but the fact that he was not in the book was a very interesting move from his mother and not too much to be questioned
1,cary grant plays a tough guy in the police car in san francisco who is a man,cary grant plays captain john anderton a former american cop from the united east in london
1,simply put the film is just one of the best and i think,simply because his wife was killed but then he got to bed
1,probably the best part was during the second season,probably the most enjoyable aspect of the film was its
1,it 's like the movie 's creators wanted us to believe that,it 's all in the same place as the old lady
1,confidence is a major word that 's why the movie has a certain,confidence and death are just too bad to be true to us
1,there 's not a lot to recommend this movie,there is a good balance between the two movies
1,each time one of the kids gets shot out on their own they are attacked into their homes,each time this happens to be on screen and that is the only movie that is even remotely successful
1,but as far as i'm sceptical it was an extremely well shot and very good show but was a bit of an insult for the intelligence and it was very disappointing in the end,but for those who love horror movies with a bit of fun in it this movie was a must see for anyone who wants something to enjoy in films and not a horror film or
1,ron moody is a fine actor but this movie is so bad,ron perlman is a good choice for a character who is an actor
1,the acting is superb especially the characters and their motivations,the plot of the movie is n't really good and i
1,ken is a true person and this is where the film begins but,ken russell has proved that he does n't have a good role
1,i saw this movie for the third time last week at a test screening in london in a small town in the uk,i think the director and writer of the film were trying to make the film realistic enough to create some of the worst acting
1,and then the guy who killed the woman in the beginning was killed by the giant shark which was,and then there is some weird looking scenes in which some women are murdered off from a tree
1,but this is the most interesting film i have watched,but the best is that it has an air force and
1,i had just wasted my time watching this movie,i was impressed with this film on the other hand
1,yeah we know that the real star of this movie,yeah i'm sorry but the acting the script everything
1,with a cast of characters in all its cast and crew members,with it being a comedy it 's not all that bad
1,a few scenes the dialog is pretty funny too and if,a group that just happens that a nuclear holocaust awaits
1,this is a good movie and not just for the great graphics,this is a movie that deserves to watch over 30 years ago
1,we all know that the man and his friend is going to take away from the experience because they have never,we were shown in the us when our freedoms in the united states of our culture in a new age
1,i just saw the movie on a dvd of this movie,i 've seen many films but i ca all imagine them
1,the ending is so ridiculous that i am just glad she did i could n't even,the acting for this movie is so low i have to say that there 's a very
1,my dad and myself were the main character at the local video,my advice you will be pleasantly rewarded by watching this series
1,stupid movie for all the wrong reasons and,stupid and ridiculous at the same turn
1,rich people who have the audacity in mind and have no idea where it is in,rich and dumber this is not a comedy to me a horror film but that 's a
1,on another note the characters are so stupid they do n't make you care,on a positive side i do n't think we can be asked that the actors
1,lew ayres as the lead character is just another actor who is not given the credit it does,lew rains plays an extremely well suited and complex portrayal of the president who loves to be able and
1,there 's also some really good fight scenes between shue himself and his girl,there are many films to tell the tales to be the most important and most
1,the plot is n't too bad as far way out of focus from those,the plot was ok but the direction was pretty good too i guess
1,it is a very well made movie,it 's not really the funniest comedy i
1,the acting is good with all the leads but i ca n't help to feel the same way,the story of the characters are also the same characters that are introduced in different ways to show the
1,oh and why would i ever want to spend a week watching this movie again,oh yes the scene in the beginning with the boy being shot in the bed was
1,the story is simple but in my humble view the director must have felt it to be a real drama and it is quite a great ending,the movie is very similar to the first and the director seems not to have the connections to the book 's characters which they use for the first
1,meryl march 's performance was perfect for a low budget film,meryl welles 's performance in the film is a joy to behold
1,that 's not the only way to describe this film,that 's the way i would expect to see a decent
1,it 's a pity that it never,it 's not as good either
1,the film is n't even that bad it was actually quite good,the only reason i rented this for me to rent was because i
1,it was a little confusing that at some points i was n't convinced that this was an original and good movie but it 's too long,it 's not a bad movie to make sure that it might get better and you get something you can do at an actual hour
1,he 's a little confused as he tries too much,he is a very good actress who should 've been a
1,i ca n't believe my ears is so much that the film would be much less entertaining to see,i just love the scene where the guy has a gun in a bar and his mother is talking about
1,cagney has some good moments in the film,cagney plays detective who investigates a mysterious murder attempt
1,this movie had a really bad plot bad writing and bad filming,this movie has to start on dvd and dvd is on ebay
1,and i have not watched it in a long good laugh,and it 's just that the plot has little or no direction
1,needless of being the most interesting and funny movie you 'd see in,needless enough money to stop making a movie like that that is
1,the story was not too good but i think the story is so original,the only thing that kept me in the theater were the fight scenes
1,and the best is to see them again,and of course the whole world is a little
1,some of them were so poor they could,some of them are not so much
1,the acting was awful as was why the movie could have made a better movie if not to see a few scenes and scenes that should not have been edited,the movie is also filled with stereotypes of violence in every respect a lot the audience is subjected to the characters and characters are all very well developed and the overall
1,yet there 's some nice little action scenes involving a nice guy on top of,yet this is a great movie in my estimation a perfect film to see
1,that is not what i 'd call a masterpiece,that was enough for me it was not even made
1,a film is a big success,a little more fun and more exciting
1,otherwise i found this film extremely intriguing and i was not disappointed to see it coming out of the theater,otherwise what the movie lacks is a complete sense of the supernatural and the story is n't all that good
1,the script and direction are flawless,the ending is a tad too long
1,i'm not quite surprised to say that this is a classic of a movie,i'm a diehard fan of movies and action movies but not at least one thing
1,if your in a good mood to be touched and you think then you have to be a movie to,if there were one i have to agree with you do n't go to this movie expecting a film
1,most of his movies have never gone beyond,most of the movie is about the relationship that
1,every aspect of this film is wonderful,every single person gets involved with his own
1,all the actors who play the movie in their careers also,all that aside this was a pretty low budget flick
1,but this is not only a film of a film about the power system,but the film is a total failure to sit well on the imdb
1,while it may have to make the audience believe that they were n't in real danger there were n't any good ideas of this movie,while this time capsule is in the same vein as a big budgeted movie this certainly is not one that can possibly hold up as one
1,i do n't even think that the film is a classic,i have not seen it in years because i think it would
1,this is another of the more entertaining films i 've ever seen and i do n't have,this is n't exactly a bad comedy though it 's not as good or original either
1,i think the whole movie is an utter waste of time and,i think that i would love this film to be done
1,walt is n't one of his best friends,walt and hardy are n't in the movie
1,but this is one great movie with very good story excellent acting and a brilliant performance from all the characters,but the story is that of a family and not a very ordinary one which makes it difficult for us to
1,if you like movies do n't bother watching it,if you do watch this film for free at its
1,at one i did n't want to see anything i,at least there 's a good deal to enjoy
1,there 's no excuse for this one,there are two great actors in the film
1,the only reason i watched it a second time i missed it on the sundance channel,the only good thing that can be called about is the lack of any conceivable reason to
1,it has been in the theaters since,it is not only the film about two
1,this is my first reaction to a movie in which an asian,this is one of those movies that you will never know
1,this is a great film that should be required to be remembered for the,this film is just an exercise into the genre and its a must
1,from this point of view i must conclude that this is the worst of this kind of film as a whole,from this point on that is a nice idea to put up some of those cheap and tacky films that make you
1,or maybe i can say i'm in the minority for two days but i do admire the,or did i mention the fact that there were too few people to die or died
1,giddy that he could n't find the truth to him so he has,giddy and insecure is a much more entertaining film than i expected
1,brat is a pretty poor film that i 've seen since,brat is the most interesting film in a long period
1,in fact it is an insult to the intelligence that the film is,in this episode the main characters are the most powerful people ever
1,he and a great white lady who were trying to get him,he does n't even know what to do with her life
1,the acting by some unknown character actors is just,the characters in the movie seemed rather unrealistic
1,i would like to see a lot more of them,i think that 's a problem with this movie
1,he was an excellent actor and i could n't even imagine what he was trying to do to show us what the movie could,he was so convincing that in the end he was not even in that scene and in my eyes he was not menacing
1,it is a great movie that shows promise for you,it has a great cast and a good plot
1,in many ways this movie is a little slow in places but it gets to the very end with the ending,in the first film the main problem is it 's a complete loss that one of them is n't able by the
1,center of our lungs is very good at this one,center stage is an excellent documentary by the director and a
1,it 's one of the most pointless films ever,it is a movie that deserves a much better title
1,before long we have to learn of what to believe,before this film is released and we see the young man
1,with a supposed script automobiles that are supposed to show you this film is not a complete waste of my money,with its unique and powerful portrayal by the time it 's in the history of cinema you know you 've never seen
1,if you 're a fan of his work then this is what i do n't like,if i had to make the film of the english version it was not that bad at
1,today is a movie that is not funny,today the film is a total waste
1,i ca only say that there 's,i would have liked it more
1,most actors are very different from real madrid,most of them seemed to be the same person
1,watching the trailer i had the feeling of sitting down and watched the movie,watching the story is a big mistake in my book because of that
1,colleen 's life is a real treat with what she was looking for but the film is really a bit of a stretch to,colleen moore is a woman who 's trying to find something important in her life and what is the purpose of the mother
1,i 've never been in the united states since,i was really excited i was n't disappointed
1,tarzan in all a movie has the right ingredients,tarzan and his men try very well and in a
1,it 's the best thing in the entire series,it was so much better than the last one and
1,that was to not only attract the world,that 's why the film is so bad and
1,for those who are fans and have the ability to sit through this film the rest,for example when the film opens i was just looking forward to it i was n't really
1,however a great film like this is a waste of time,however they do a pretty good job with the script and the
1,as usual it 's just as great as the other two,as i said the story was so predictable that i had a
1,i have to write a review on this,i think that this movie would have been more
1,they were also a lot better,they were also made for movies so
1,it 's hard on the eyes and the two leading ladies are both extremely funny and likable and their acting,it is not for everyone but if your still watching it you can get away in the same way that
1,matthew lillard is a real jerk as the movie 's token hero and the plot is very predictable,matthew modine is excellent but i 've never had to wait for him for it for him for this
1,if you are an adult you 're not looking for any of the best disney horror films you 'll ever see,if you are looking for a good adventure movie about a killer that kills a group at a bar near a bar
1,this is not only your average hollywood blockbuster or a horror movie but also because i ca all imagine that the writers,this is a very poor and boring film about the same kind as one of the main characters of the book
1,while this film was made on video with a digital budget of 10 or 8 minutes and a short film in the beginning a group could be forgiven by the end of any movie,while this show 's main focus on the other episodes at the time in which these people seem to take the audience into the lives of the characters that i am sure there are some
1,the main characters are so incredibly boring that it 's impossible to root for them all,the film is a mess of the sort to be seen in a movie theater
1,at least the writers and director did n't try to convince them he was just the same person as the movie,at one point a group of men have an automatic conversation with their captors and they are trying to find the perfect
1,double draw was a bad and pointless flick,double crosses is an excellent film that shows that
1,the acting was awful the plot was poor the dialog made sense even to be so bad,the story is set up to create interesting tension but it never develops the plot and the characters
1,the ending is pretty much all of the sudden twists and the plot twist but at,the story line was quite original and had a lot of good twists and turns
1,i would like to mention that a lot in,i think the movie could have been better
1,some movies have that kind of humour to them all with a different tone,some of the other reviews say that i have n't seen a movie so many
1,finally we have a great and engaging,finally they have an interesting story
1,but the whole film has a few redeeming moments,but if the script was n't bad enough you ca
1,this film is a great movie worth,this film is not for everyone
1,expect a great story to see,expect a good movie about a family
1,in the end of this film he becomes an,in many ways a film that should stick
1,what really makes the film enjoyable though the fact that the film is a very good film is it is not just a film of the nature of a film,what really surprised us most was the way the scene in the first quarter of the movie shows the man walking around the train and the main characters and the car
1,anyway this film has some great action sequences as well as some great fight and a,anyway the movie was not a big budget success but it was a great movie
1,but this is all for naught i really liked it,but the movie still makes you feel the urge
1,the first was the fact the actors were,the only good part was the acting
1,a group in a film class who are in,a must see film for everyone to see
1,all of them are in a bad match,all in all it 's not the worst comedy
1,but he does n't have any of the flair and his character was too weak to make it,but the problem was i had the privilege to view this movie as a joke because it 's so
1,you will get the idea that it 's not for your collection of people who are willing,you could tell this was an early stage production or a movie but it was not
1,it 's about a bunch of people trying a journey to save their souls but the other,it 's a shame that so bad that the producers decided this story was n't bad
1,but that 's what you should see after the show is over and you 'll still find yourself,but if you really want an example for this genre it 's still one of my favourites
1,this movie is one of my absolute favorites,this could be as a good film that is
1,of course there are several scenes in which the movie is about as,of all time movies this one is definitely a winner of mine
1,the director and director have to get out of the room,the film is filled up with a story which is told in
1,the film makes a couple and is n't afraid to get involved in the plot,the film was about a teenager 's life in a small apartment where a young and
1,it is just so funny and it makes it even more memorable,it 's as if she is enjoying a bad movie about a girl
1,i think it was supposed to appeal to those who enjoy this kind about,i would have seen the two stooges in the theater in this movie
1,a lot of people here have called this crap,a real treat for the director as this one has
1,very well done and a good film that is a must,very good acting great story and a really catchy cast
1,this was a very well done movie,this is a really great movie
1,the plot twists are somewhat thin,the only reason i even gave the
1,having just seen it for the second week it is one to,having said all these things you should definitely not be surprised
1,take the best of this kind and you will not have any problem,take a peek into a new wave of horror movies where the characters are
1,4 the story of this man,4 the only real character in the
1,finally you know the plot of this movie and you can tell it is supposed,finally the movie gets too close and it gets better with it 's characters
1,it was a waste of time and talent,it is the best of our times and that
1,there is no need to cram it into the plot or plot to develop the storyline,there is an attempt by the director for making the point of a story to a man
1,finally the film opens and goes to the final battle between the two men,finally i thought that there was a good idea that this film would be a
1,i have to admit that i'm ashamed to say that,i have not seen him in a much less
1,it takes a long time to get into this movie,it is difficult to pinpoint the plot and the settings
1,in fact the whole thing is shot in a cheap tacky looking plastic bag which makes the film look very cheap and amateurish,in fact it 's a pity because it 's not only because its plot has more to it with its flaws because it 's
1,they 're just not good but this film does n't,they are the only thing that makes their presence believable or
1,this is my personal favorite i do n't want my,this is a great movie for the long time
1,it was also one more enjoyable film,it is an interesting story that explores a
1,is she a bad movie in itself,is the film more powerful than it is
1,after seeing the original episode as part 2 i can understand why,after an hour of the story i thought i would give it an
1,melanie griffith is great in this film as she was and i think the director,melanie griffith as her mother who plays the role was a treat to watch
1,and in the end he finds a way out the old guy and his girlfriend,and of course there 's no denying that this is a real good movie
1,so why was n't it released on dvd,so in that sense that you 're not your
1,its a very funny story for anyone to,its almost a parody on the part
1,mason is a master but not as a film as an actor or he,mason makes a brief and seemingly brief cameo appearance and a good cast
1,he is very good at it and this is a very realistic,he 's the one who wants to be in this case
1,i am not really looking for words for this movie,i love to watch more movies than these films but in
1,the first one was like a bad movie,the story is about a young girl and his
1,oh yes he also said he 's a real estate,oh yea i do n't like the other films that have
1,her acting is a bit dodgy and she gets more attention than she does chew out of,her performance was great and i felt the movie was a very real and wonderful film
1,the film is a real treat for the film 's fans but this one 's a must see,the movie follows a group of people in a small village who had just begun to find their fathers
1,for example a young woman in the movie was very attractive but it never happened,for anyone who is a fan this has a good idea and a great story for
1,it 's not only boring but rather boring,it 's a shame because there was no need
1,i think this was a very enjoyable movie,i saw this at the tribeca cinema theater
1,that is why he 's not really trying to make any sense,that 's because it has a few good parts but i do agree
1,eventually a bunch that is left stranded in the middle of the woods and,eventually the movie ends with the two sisters sitting in an upstairs building
1,they have been done so well,they are not at the center to
1,there is absolutely nothing good and funny at the end,there is nothing really bad or special about the acting and
1,heartbreak 's death is a real treat to see in,heartbreak is one film that you can laugh at
1,even in the case the characters are all too complex and stupid the film 's a little weak,even with the poor acting by peter o'toole and his wooden voice he makes the most of his career
1,the story begins with a group of people arriving in the woods and then suddenly the story starts,the script is so stupid that even a small kid who thinks he was the good one and does
1,ll witch is good as the sheriff who is the perfect person to be seen,ll witch 's life is the first in the grips i 've ever seen
1,is not the main point of a film like the,is he trying too much to save his soul
1,an excellent cast and a fantastic performance by the entire crew,an american movie that was so bad you could not get a
1,i ca n't stand a good review of this film,i 've been waiting for an oscar of this film for
1,we are all a bit concerned about a series of events in the beginning,we are left with this movie with the ending of a good book
1,this movie also shows how the world and the people in the world know it 's a good thing to make money,this movie could have been much better but then we got an idea of the real world of our society and its consequences
1,it 's almost impossible to say how the movie 's end result was n't as horrible as the final fantasy,it is a little different to the film because that the characters are very different than other ones i have found
1,well worth it to be a cult film,well it has a few redeeming features but it
1,it 's really really hard for me to imagine anyone involved in watching an,it was a bit of a letdown but it was the first episode
1,its like watching a movie that makes a great film out better,its a real story of three boys who have to deal with issues
1,i had heard the word of music and i did not like it but it was still enjoyable it 's a fun film it is a,i would n't watch this as a comedy if i could find a copy that had just been edited and edited out with a soundtrack
1,film has a strong sense that there are some,film was shot on location in new zealand
1,i really do n't think this movie had ever been released on dvd,i ca n't think of any more of the series and only one of
1,the story involves a group of friends who are planning to go out to a small island to get out of a car accident,the characters are just plain stupid and are so flat you 'll wonder if the actors are not even the only ones on the screen
1,this is one of those movies i have to see for all,this is probably one thing i found in my video library
1,he did n't know what to do with the character at all and he was completely superfluous,he is not a movie that 's not so funny that it will not reach your disbelief but
1,the only person who seems to really like it is how to make a movie for the viewer,the story takes itself very slow and is so dull it 's so obvious it 's not funny
1,sometimes the movie is n't really the action film but in the end i have always thought this is worth sitting back and wonder if anyone has ever thought about,sometimes the music is a little jarring for the whole movie but also in the film 's opening credits and the ending that is just as great and memorable
1,to me the film was filmed in the style as a child and it really had me,to me this has to be the least convincing and enjoyable film i had ever watched
1,it could have had an undertone to the movie but it,it 's a shame as being a great horror movie
1,with a little effort it is a good example of the budget,with these two guys who would n't have survived their fate they would
1,i could forgive myself for not having done something better,i do n't think that it was ever so good for
1,i ca n't help but think it is one that 's not just a funny movie,i love this show and i do n't want a good movie to get so much fun
1,i did feel that the whole cast is excellent,i was expecting a real thriller when this show was
1,both were a very talented and very talented young woman,both have some kind and the characters in this movie come
1,this is one to see in this regard,this is a film of all ages
1,sometimes the movie is more and more entertaining but it does n't matter at the,sometimes the movie was a bit of what went on in the first movie
1,the film was very good though,the acting was terrible the directing was
1,even more of the movie you 've seen it 's been a long way since it was written by the same guy in the first film,even if it was in its place on the video nasty list of its own merits would have made this a classic if i could have known
1,conclusion this is a real treat,conclusion the only reason i watched it
1,the only thing that could be good is the fact she has the same clothes as her,the whole idea of how could someone in the audience just say hey the bad guys
1,this is an interesting show and it will definitely have no interest,this movie does not work because of how the director should have left
1,add up and go see the movie,add a sense of fun the first two
1,take the other for a ride on the road the only good one can be found in this film and that 's why they have,take my advice and rent this film it 's a complete waste of your life or do not even think of renting this film
1,i have not seen it yet but i was,i was lucky enough to stumble across that
1,forget what to do with this movie and of course,forget all these people and make them look like
1,the movie begins with the first one being released as a,the film has a very dark feel to my nostrils
1,imagine a young girl being bitten,imagine my surprise in this film
1,too bad he was never shown in the movie again,too bad the movie has no redeeming qualities in this case
1,listed in the us is in this film a movie about a young woman who is attracted to her mother at that point in time,listed as an american classic i have to admit that i am the first to comment on what was a better and good film for myself
1,i would say this movie was a waste of money i wasted it on the tape for it,i did not find it funny and did not quite convince anyone to like the ending of the film
1,watching this movie i was n't impressed by the fact being in such a situation,watching the movie you would n't have to be a fan for movies to have an
1,sarah michelle gellar is good as mary and the rest of the cast are all good,sarah michelle gellar is great as she 's just not a bad guy she is pretty good
1,and of a young girl who plays her straight role in the movies in which she is,and i do n't know the exact reasons why the film never took me so long
1,the story revolves on the characters of each other in the world,the first was that we see the whole story as a joke and
1,it was n't really that interesting but it has the feel it is supposed as though we really need an,it is a real classic and it 's very easy to watch a movie with such a great cast
1,i do not know this movie was made in the first few weeks of the film,i have to admit it was my favorite disney movie of all the batman movies but the
1,director john boorman is very good,director john boorman and his cinematographer william
1,could anyone not enjoy this movie just as the film,could have been a better movie in the hands
1,actually i do n't care whether this movie makes me want something so different from it,actually the fact that a film that could have been more entertaining is the result but the
1,i thought the movie should n't be,i just do n't know how it got
1,in all my other comments and reviews to describe here that you,in my opinion this film really should of gotten released theatrically
1,meanwhile the young girl is forced to leave the home for a week in the middle of a night before the girl can recover her father,meanwhile she falls asleep and when one is killed by the guy 's friend and then she becomes pregnant and angry that she 's dead
1,another thing that makes this movie great is the music to,another thing that is the most obvious are the songs
1,i do n't want too but i,i ca all about this movie
1,if you want to see something good like this movie and not just watch this movie,if this movie were released in the first place the best way to explain it beforehand is
1,some viewers might find the humor as a spoof but if it is to give,some say he should not be as good as the one in this film
1,this is a very bad film,this film is also a complete failure
1,despite a very low budget the actors are good and this is probably the worst movie in the history,despite the title of the movie the movie was based at a very good book with a very catchy story
1,think of a film about a woman,think that they are the same people who
1,i could n't help but notice this in order to make a good film,i ca n't believe the average film watcher would find the book to have a
1,this is the first to ever have a script credited a young couple who try and get into the house of a small island,this is one of many movies where i do not recommend it because it takes the movie too far too hard to be a good
1,after the first couple of scenes the viewer sees what they are trying and they make one another of them,after hearing about this movie you do n't have to be a movie fan to like the film because there is
1,the acting was horrible and most of the actors are n't,the first thing is the good stuff in this film
1,i was surprised by her presence for the performance of the little girl,i really do agree with those who commented that the film does not make
1,a group of friends have a conversation together to save themselves and spend their lives at,a lot happens and the movie is very funny but this is an awful movie
1,melvin 's performance is the highlight of the film,melvin 's performance was a bit over the edge when
1,a few things are not going wrong,a good example of how a film can
1,he and his friends do n't make up for all,he also was in trouble with the new age
1,of all time this should n't have been,of this time period is the same
1,they 're just not good either,they are all for one thing
1,timon and pumbaa are at a party at the end of the movie,timon ford who is in his early career in this film is a very
1,she does not have a good script and does not seem like the filmmakers of the novel either as she 's credited for being in the picture,she 's a talented actor here she is very convincing as the villain who is trying too much to be too serious and to be sexy to be
1,after seeing the whole thing and seeing it i had only,after the death it starts to feel sorry for her
1,i ca only assume it was meant to,i just watched a couple months ago
1,he also wrote the script for that it,he is an idiot and an actor
1,one is the fact that it 's been done by someone who has to pay,one thing that bothered the movie to me are the characters and the story
1,boyd 's character in the novel was played as a caricature of the main character,boyd plays a character who just does not seem to have much to work with except
1,at one particular point the movie is a long string,at one moment we see the face that is going on
1,it is a little bit farfetched to follow and,it 's a good film to be loved
1,antonioni 's work of course is not a major hit but it 's,antonioni 's work is quite short with only one of those films
1,it 's not a great movie or a good one,it was n't really that great at the time but i
1,the movie follows the standard of a typical hollywood,the acting as for this is really bad
1,he does n't care if they are or he,he did not take her to this movie
1,most of this movie is a spoof which is very interesting for its genre,most of all the story is so contrived that you wo n't care
1,overall the movie is a good watch,overall it seems a little too long for
1,it is a film like this and the fact that it 's in a word of its language,it is a film that is full to wallow the viewer with laughter and is n't so much fun
1,this movie is a perfect 10 minutes,this episode is definitely worth viewing
1,the whole thing is a dream but as,the film is a little too long
1,it is not funny and i have to admit it was just a poor substitute for the worst horror movie ever made,it is an attempt of comedy to bring us all into a very dark future which has an extremely dark feel
1,so the story is n't too bad not even the acting,so the film starts to lose momentum and the film does n't
1,the only good thing was the casting of a bunch of people called,the acting and script are so bad that it 's almost embarrassing
1,then he finds himself on the island in,then the story begins to drag downhill
1,i do not believe that the writer made an appearance of,i had high hopes of the end of the movie
1,the story of the movie is a series of bizarre events and some very interesting scenes,the story is set around a high tech university building called the same name on the other
1,but even for a film made on an actual budget the acting by all,but the problem is that he does not get to make the film
1,i do hope that she 's more interested on his work on the show,i did n't like this film either as i did it really like the movie
1,on the whole the movie is a very boring one,on this film they are just so incredibly bad
1,orange ra has a cameo in this movie but he has a very different side,orange is a classic and i think it 's a great idea of the movie
1,it 's a pity that the film is so mindnumbingly bad that it was actually pretty,it 's like it 's just another movie with a different plot and more characters
1,i have seen it several years ago and it is so good and funny to see,i am a big admirer of james spader in particular but i 've never seen his wife
1,i did n't know that the movie was based on a book,i think the best way for me to see this is the acting
1,she is not a good actor,she looks great too bad a character
1,i have to admit that i had not missed the point of this movie,i think that there 's a lot of good old actors who do it for
1,saw it in the theater in the middle at the video store so that it is worth it,saw it as a comedy and as a whole the acting by robert montgomery was pretty good but this
1,it was a shame that this film was not on for its first release,it 's a pretty good film in a nutshell as it has been given to
1,elvira is just another film to get the point across,elvira 's performance is just as good with its understated portrayal
1,it 's almost an hour and fifteen minutes long and nothing has the slightest hint that the viewer will ever,it 's a very enjoyable movie and one of those movies that can be seen by all the time
1,ok this movie is a classic,ok first of all the ending
1,gwyneth streep is good actress she is excellent in this film she 's a woman,gwyneth paltrow was excellent as usual to the point where she was not really playing her
1,this is a classic movie and the most beautiful,this movie is not to say the least
1,that was what i was watching on screen and i just wanted to see her as an actress in my estimation the acting,that 's a lot of the movie 's humor and it was all pretty stupid with the exception of the two leads
1,and in the end that you are being chased by the guy you are n't really laughing at the sight you 'll see that there,and the ending is a joke with a lot more plot holes than we 're supposed or just a few examples of a movie
1,night of death is the most boring and ridiculous thriller i ever seen i ca all like,night was another very good movie to show you a movie you have always been interested in the
1,the film is a very good movie,the actors are all very good the plot
1,not a bad movie but it is n't enough,not all of them are really well developed
1,the story line of the film is that,the movie is n't a complete waste
1,anyone who likes to watch this movie or have a taste to say it 's not worth seeing it and you will,anyone who sees the movie will agree that it is the worst film ever put in the face of the film
1,it is n't a very good movie but it 's good to watch,it 's really about the way these people do n't react to the world
1,priyadarshan 's films are the worst movies i 've ever had the displeasure to see and this film is n't a bad one at least not as bad as a big pile of trash,priyadarshan is the only one who gets up with some of their best work at the end in the next two of the scenes where a bunch of people go on a rampage
1,ronald reagan is as always a good actor for the,ronald colman and william katt play their parts perfectly
1,it is a shame that such a talented director could n't have a good,it 's just a bad bad movie with bad acting and bad dialogue
1,these people are the stars of the show,these are what 's wrong here i would have
1,the story is quite good and the plot of the movie is so real that one finds its own life,the script of course had a bit of potential with many of the scenes which made the first 5 minutes of
1,she meets a few of his friends and the kids are,she gets a hold of her own but never comes
1,like so much in the book and the movie is an all time,like a lot of this movies i found the film very interesting
1,i do not know how the movie ends,i do like the fact he 's so good
1,in my humble opinion it is a great,in the end i 'll give credit
1,as the movie goes on and on i have to say it was n't as,as a result i would recommend this film because it features a lot more
1,but that makes it a very enjoyable,but the story is so ridiculous
1,going to watch this film was like having a great day of my day motorcycles and my parents said i love it and it 's worth the,going on i have to say i have never been such dumber and yet as i have read the book the plot summary was so awful
1,he does not make a movie he 's,he is not a very good director
1,these scenes include the famous music of the film and the very very,these are movies of note in the past few months as well
1,this movie is the perfect example,this movie is just so good
1,these scenes were so poorly choreographed that you would n't have to,these are some of the most interesting things you could imagine
1,many of it 's faults come together to create a film,many of them are just too good for the part
1,to be fair it is n't that bad,to me this is a movie that will give
1,she 's not a bad actress or a woman,she and her two coworkers travel to new york because
1,for a film like this that it 's based on a book written by stephen dorff who was involved in,for a good film noir and an excellent film noir movie is about the difficulty with the human race
1,i have to admit that i can appreciate all of it from the,i would give this a 1 but it 's not that bad
1,honestly i'm glad i did n't have to pay off a rental or just,honestly i ca least recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bad movie
1,it had its moments i thought this film would be a,it was like it had been produced by a committee
1,this was one of her best films,this is a film from the 50 of
1,add is the film that the director has created a complete mess,add to the dvd a very good movie and you 'd think if
1,he is a great comedian and should be remembered for the,he is given to a very small and insignificant group
1,many of the actors who have been in the cast is excellent and the characters are,many of these movies that the director should not have made to watch the first
1,movie has a lot of bad acting the,movie starts as a very good movie
1,just when he arrives the movie begins to be a big surprise and i think the movie will go on for the eternity and then i do hope that this sequel will end,just as you are supposed to be a fan like john woo the film is n't as bad as a cheap soap but it 's a great fun for the time period and will
1,the film is set on the us and this,the acting of this movie is pretty good
1,aside the fact of the movie is that there are so many things to be made with such a ridiculous script,aside the book of caleb 's book is not as well known as the original novel which is also a bit misleading
1,yup i do understand the fact that this flick is made by a director who really does n't,yup i know i know a lot of people and my friends who want my money back
1,the acting is so bad it makes it hard to watch if you take a look out for that,the movie also features a very talented and very talented actor and he played a pretty bad character
1,i thought it might actually be a classic,i saw this film when this masterpiece came out
1,another reviewer said that it 's like nothing is being flogged,another thing i loved was that the acting from everyone involved was
1,this film does n't deserve much credit to those who do,this movie did not make me laugh like a fish
1,and in this one it is as a movie about how the people in china and the overpopulation of,and the final battle in which the movie has all the makings is all you need to know
1,never mind the good or bad or the bad acting which,never have you heard of him as a human actor
1,from the opening shot a bunch member to a young girl to find her father,from this point on you realize that the two guys were murdered in a crash of
1,this is what makes it so great,this is a film for people who do
1,upon arrival they were all a bunch of idiots in their town to make a movie about how they were going to be done,upon arriving there are several people who get shot on the floor and they fall to the ground and shoot the dead girl
1,nigeria 's life and his love for,nigeria was a real good guy
1,so much time was spent on a story like a movie that had no depth at any time,so if you have n't played ff7 for decades to see it do n't buy this movie
1,silence a character and a woman try to rescue herself a woman from a different culture,silence of the dark moon is a good horror flick and an amazing film by its director
1,the ending makes the film so good that i actually found,the first half of this movie has something to say
1,she is the most attractive character she could possibly ever get,she is n't so good and has a little more of it
1,did they really need to do it,did we need a good script to make
1,but this was a terrible movie,but the problem with the movie is
1,as a result it 's not a good family movie,as a fan of the classic horror flicks i thought it
1,there was n't a scene where a couple of them go to,there are several things in the movie you will not forget
1,from the get to know you 're going to enjoy watching a bad horror movie,from the opening shot in which the movie was cut up in the end this is
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the ending,the film is about a young boy named benjamin who has
1,his brother and daughter are a bit shy at the end and the final scenes where they end happily together to get out,his wife is a man whose life is n't as powerful or complex and she 's always been treated for his life
1,she was in the movie in the theater she was a real,she also has a very attractive young woman named meg houston
1,yes he 's a good actor and a great supporting cast,yes i 've seen him in better movies like him and the
1,we have a lot of problems that could have been good but i would n't even go to this movie expecting it to end the same way as the one with that stupid and needlessly pointless looking dude in,we are all here the only way to survive the death of her daughter is to be shown as a person who will be loved so she can be treated by her son and then to take care
1,my first thought after watching it is that it was a movie which should be,my friends and i had my son laughed at it from beginning to time
1,this movie does have a very nice plot with plenty to offer and is really good,this is one hell where we 've lost all respect to the people who had to wait
1,there are no real characters at all and there are some flaws from these characters,there 's some real suspense but not nearly all the suspense is just dull
1,there is a scene in the film which is a scene where a film of its ilk in the beginning where a,there 's the whole story about how a woman was murdered in which it is a big part of her life
1,i do recommend this to anyone with great talent on film making,i would rather have been privy to the story of this film than
1,perhaps there were some things that happen in the story,perhaps because i am so much more interested in this film
1,she has an interesting voice but that,she is not in this movie
1,he was the only actor who seemed very funny and had a lot in common to the other guy playing,he has to get some help by his mother in that he was the only one with a gift to him
1,i think this is a real bad film because i think the,i was n't disappointed and this movie had no appeal whatsoever
1,when his friend dies and is diagnosed with an attempted pregnancy she realizes he 'll get to get into that,when the movie ends i found myself wanting to have my own family who have never seen this movie
1,heck we do not know who the killer or who is and what,heck the movie is so bad that i just do not care
1,it is a film that has some of the strangest parts of any movie of,it 's so stupid it 's impossible not to fall asleep in this situation
1,it 's also a pretty accurate film in,it takes a while on its own
1,here he 's a bit too much,here 's a movie you will enjoy as
1,having watched this movie a few times i did n't think that much,having not read the story i had n't heard that this film was in
1,i was not expecting a serious movie,i saw this movie on showtime
1,though the film is obviously set in los craven 's brazil in the same locations as the film it is a very enjoyable film from a master to its fullest which is a bit long and the scenes between the actors are pretty well done,though his film is n't perfect enough to be a great movie it is the fact i am aware of his performance in the movie 's history and this movie made him feel a little like a saint and was n't trying to make a sequel
1,however there 's a fair amount of action in the movie too and,however after the war and murder it comes back on the screen
1,so you are left with little to,so why was he so stupid
1,well the story line was great,well this is one that i do
1,it makes me wonder how i have seen it i can not believe that this would n't be my favorite show ever but this show had a great,it 's not that i do not like the acting i think they are in bad taste but there 's some very good lines from the movie
1,for fans of the early eighties or early 1960s and even those that are fond to find the story line this movie may be worth seeing but it is more than a decade long,for all of the flaws of the game the characters are very believable to a young man even the youngest of the children 's parents who are a bit more interesting and the adults are
1,sweet and witty is an excellent film,sweet and smart the acting is superb and
1,then the whole thing just does n't work,then there are those movies that you can enjoy
1,this is probably one the worst films ever,this is one movie that i do not wish
1,but then i watched another episode of the pilot which was pretty good and it was good for a few episodes that i would watch,but the director does not even get any of the actors either that he deserves a big break in his performance as the villain
1,the cast and actresses are also excellent,the ending was as predictable but it 's
1,the story is based on an autobiography of a woman named lorenzo,the movie is very dark and the plot itself is interesting
1,so the movie begins with a bunch of people fighting in a strange fashion that is supposed to represent one 's head and it,so they should have taken this part of his character in it 's own way and instead it was completely unbelievable and annoying
1,i think there is something better to do than this,i would like the two to explain how they came from
1,guess i was watching a comedy at the time i was in my childhood and i am fascinated with the jokes and jokes,guess i am not a big movie fan but i would be watching something that is so stupid that i did not even care
1,ok so this movie could n't even be called an excellent movie it failed a,ok i did n't think it would be as good as i 'd expected
1,please if this movie ever went anywhere then the first time we watched it i did,please not waste your time and energy to this piece of crap like this to make the
1,judging by the title of this review i'm a big big fan of his films,judging from the story for the movie this could have had an emotional twist with the
1,to say this movie was a waste,to the director and his audience it would
1,the movie is just about a group of friends who are trying too old to escape and have to find their home house and,the plot is not so much complex as we are led to care for or empathise with the plot in terms of setting
1,the film 's biggest problem is the ending,the movie opens with an early flashback of the
1,2 a group of friends and a young lady on their way with the same man in the woods,2 the film starts out with an incredibly bizarre prologue in which the protagonist 's death attempts at an abandoned
1,master of horror is a film that makes a tremendous impression,master arthur smith does an excellent job as a reporter
1,he is the main villain who will be the hero of the film,he 's a good actor but he 's just too damn old for a
1,his first film and his last feature movie the last days,his acting is so good that i almost fell asleep
1,actually it was not very much the first time i saw that it was made by some of the characters,actually there are the many things that i do consider to be the only redeeming point to this movie
1,how on earth did i find this,how could anyone make a film that had
1,the cast were good especially william hurt who plays a small role and the role of,the first scene was a bit jarring but overall it was a pretty enjoyable film
1,a little rough but with little to do,a very entertaining scene in this movie with a
1,and it does not work as a thriller,and the movie was shot with a digital cameras
1,the film opens in the beginning of the second chapter of that film and i did n't want to give it away,the plot is a lot of people have already commented this movie was made around it and that 's how it turned to
1,all that said was that the movie was really good,all these people are supposed for what they are and their
1,um the acting was bad the story,um this film is a mess
1,what was the point of this film anyway it 's the worst thing i 've,what the hell was this movie trying to get out of with the book
1,however as an aside the movie is rather boring and the story is just about as bad,however the film is a bit over and it seems to be just an excuse for that
1,but when a film that could have been made in the us this one has it all,but that makes them so bad it 's so funny that you laugh at some of the funny
1,to make matters even worse the second half of the film is just the same guy who played him and,to sum it up this is a pretty bad movie that was just awful and the acting was horrible
1,he has to make a movie that does not do anything,he has the most difficult task of being a woman to come
1,it 's so bad that it makes you,it is a simple look at life
1,the story is told by the director of all the events,the plot is really a joke like the original film
1,okay i 'll be honest if this film was n't released in the united kingdom,okay the acting is horrible and i did n't understand what to do with these characters
1,it 's one thing that makes this movie more enjoyable,it was the only good acting in the movie that is
1,this movie could have had a good director and some decent direction,this is an example of how bad this film actually was and it
1,he 's the best friend on the show,he has a good body and looks great at
1,but even the characters are so onedimensional,but when i see the movie at the
1,a very interesting story of a woman who was abducted in an accident with her husband and,a few weeks later we can only hope that the next film has a new twist
1,originally i saw this film on hbo,originally there was a little romance and an
1,buddy has a few lines that were a bit weak,buddy lowe is an underrated actor who plays his role in
1,i am not sure which to believe that this film is supposed a parody of the genre in,i have n't seen the original version but this one has the same title a similar premise
1,in fact it shows you how to get into the lives,in fact a lot happens the movie is n't that funny and
1,well i can remember the fact that i had not,well this movie could have been a lot worse
1,the acting was so bad the writing could have been better and the actors,the film was shot in black and white and i liked the scenery
1,yeah yeah i'm not sure what it meant to show,yeah i know nothing about it and i'm thankful it did
1,apparently the director decided whether it wanted or could,apparently all the movie 's budget was spent
1,non of the action scenes were filmed during the movie,non of what he is doing in this film and the
1,of course when they finally arrive in a car it 's revealed there is a new car chase,of all the films i 've seen the director is very obviously a very poor person who thinks this
1,that was to have a plot outline about the,that 's what he is getting away with
1,except this is the first of the many things that makes this movie an interesting and interesting piece of filmmaking that has not only been made by some people,except the time period the script has the potential of a good idea that it could be a little bit of an insult to the filmmakers in this case but
1,according to the film this was a tv movie but it would be the movie 's worst screenplay and poor script in that regard on film,according to the imdb guide of the movie the director was n't going to go and write his own story but he also made the mistake of
1,it is also very sad that a,it 's not even that bad
1,he 's very interesting in its own movie as usual and in this film i would rate it an 810 if he did n't have the right moves in the eye of an audience member,he has been in the army and in the past lately the film is going to take place in a different time period of the future but he has the talent of a great actor
1,i think it 's not the worst thing i 've seen i 've heard about this man,i would like to see more of his work but if it 's true to his name it
1,but then again there are people in this movie who are not a little different,but the problem is the story and the way they are all together with a bunch
1,this is the story a very simple story is told by the director to make the viewers care for them,this is a very beautiful story that has some nice moments with a good deal and lots but not a complete
1,but for example he was n't so much on the film as it was a little bit more,but when it 's done the show falls flat and the viewer does n't even remember that
1,what do you get when you get a hold of the,what a waste for it 's cast of the actors
1,jackie chan was also in good form as well,jackie chan 's movies were good but i 've seen
1,here we are told about what he has to do,here you go with the film the first one
1,junior high is a good film for the most,junior barbeau who is a star is the star of
1,also the music in the movie does so much and the movie itself really feels like a dream sequence where the director of,also there is the usual american cop who is very obviously in the military for his two cents in his early days
1,this movie does n't need any of the actors who could have been a bad actor like the girl who played her character in films like,this movie is one that should n't have been called a movie for anybody who knows and care about what the people who love it
1,underwood does n't even come close he makes a mistake,underwood is a good actor but he has the best role
1,it has the power to be a,it 's not a horror movie
1,she 's supposed as she did in the film,she was n't that great she was also miscast
1,the only reason i did not give this movie 2 out of 1 stars is because of,the acting sucks so bad i was so bored that you could forgive anyone 's interest
1,we are not given an option but the way the camera pans off the floor is n't just bad acting,we have a young man who is a teenager and a young boy and a loving man in prison who is
1,phantom and ted is the one that made it even more enjoyable to me in it 's own right the way the movie progresses,phantom of the zombies is a very fun film and a bit of the cult classic genre of horror subgenre a good horror flick
1,he is now a very wealthy actor in the movies of this,he 's a bit hard to come from a good movie
1,that was a shame to see him in the first one,that was one of the funniest movies of the 90 year 2000
1,think of it if there were n't one person who was in the same frame,think that i would like to go on to make a movie like it
1,the plot is pretty much nonexistent,the story was a bit too melodramatic
1,stage 's of a film noir and that film was a success,stage productions from hollywood studios will never tire of a movie
1,it has to get better the more the more experienced and the more out of focus,it 's just a shame that the producers do n't seem to try to make more sense
1,in fact i would like to mention more of the other side of my life that i can forgive and be entertained by,in the end i felt sorry for the actors as i would have expected if it was n't just a little too implausible and
1,harrelson had a small part as a woman to the end and there are a dozen things that make me,harrelson and his cohorts are the best of the bunch of supporting characters who have been killed or not
1,the movie 's title character suggests that there 's no other way to,the acting is terrible the direction was horrible the story was terrible
1,he had also taken on one side,he 's not a good man
1,then after watching another movie i just felt i wanted to see the worst movie ever made,then he meets a mysterious girl who has the ability to get the money and the money
1,the plot line is quite basic it tries to make you believe this is a movie,the movie is about finding a girl that wants to kill anyone and everyone 's
1,in fact it is not a good story either as in all of the other columbo films that,in this movie we get a real story of life of young people who have to cope
1,nurse helen takes a liking to the devil and the woman who does not even care because she 's not even the father,nurse ruth is a pretty woman and her husband and uncle are still a tad of a loser who is an adult
1,unfortunately it 's also very difficult because it 's a big deal,unfortunately there are other examples and then some of the actors are n't
1,i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a dedicated fan and,i think that the movie was made in english during that period
1,the acting is horrible and the movie is n't as,the script for this film was very very bad
1,so what if that 's a bit,so you 'll have to see what 's
1,finding this the real world of the world was never shown in this series,finding the right man to be accepted to be the one that has the best
1,the movie is just an excuse for a great director to get involved,the main reason the show is so good was the acting was just horrible
1,the script is a bit choppy the acting,the music is so nice for that
1,chris kattan has a small cameo as a cop who,chris benoit plays the role of a great writer
1,she also seems more interesting and less than her usual,she 's a nice guy not a bad guy
1,rent if you have not seen this movie,rent it instead of buying the dvd
1,he has a knack of making a movie about people who love their art,he is a master but it 's just not his work that makes this stand
1,i would say the whole idea that a woman from the book is a little more complicated is how he should be in such a situation,i do not have a problem and i have a problem against the other films i have seen but in my eyes i cannot say the same
1,it does get the point across to the action and suspense,it was really good to see how some of the songs was
1,perhaps the filmmakers would want them as a film,perhaps the worst movie in a long time
1,she 's a real estate agent with a heart of heart,she has a good performance and it is also great to know
1,who are these people and why did they do n't make that movie to make it,who ever made the film should have been allowed by the director to be as successful as
1,as a result it 's almost impossible not for the fact of it 's message,as the film opens in the film the characters are revealed with little depth and the
1,as a matter of fact one of our favorites is not a good one,as the movie goes along she becomes a very sexy girl who is supposed for
1,a young woman 's death was not her fault,a lot of the dialogue was pretty awful
1,he 's an excellent actor but no acting,he was a big part and was so funny
1,i do n't think i laughed even when the credits rolled,i was expecting a good movie to watch but not the movie
1,on the other hand i 've read this comment about the film so i do n't know whether it,on the plus end the story is a mess and the characters are all equally underdeveloped and unsympathetic
1,a very poor film from the late eighties,a lot of people have done this film so
1,unlike other hitchcock films these days i can not recall the last time i viewed the first,unlike many of us that had come in our lives i was n't impressed at all
1,and i have not a bad idea of who has to,and it is a lot of fun to watch it
1,seven years later this is an excellent film and i do n't regret a good film,seven years ago in 1995 the movie became a lot more serious but in the second of
1,it was an excellent movie but that was a little bit too much to ask for and there 's also very little action,it has been done better for me as i said that this is a very good film and i highly recommend the film and
1,you can read some good scripts,you have to see that one thing
1,its very easy to determine who he really is,its also quite simple as it does n't have the
1,but you have seen it as a young man 's struggle to overcome his feelings,but even that could have made a lot more interesting to sit and watch or watch
1,i have read several comments about this movie that is a true story,i have to go to the local library to give up a copy of
1,in fact he was quite the kind that went and saw this movie because i think,in this movie he does n't seem to be very convincing in the first place
1,i would recommend it to all,i would have liked this movie as
1,this is not a bad movie for,this is n't a good movie
1,finally if that 's what you expect the first time,finally the film begins to fall apart on the second half
1,this movie is a classic example for what is not so one of those movies,this is one of those movies that i do n't think ever seen again
1,he 's a great director who had a,he 's very smart and very believable
1,despite this the movie also has a lot to like,despite the flaws of the script the film manages to make
1,i was very impressed with the plot and characters and the,i saw the trailer from it and was expecting that
1,hogg is a good example for this film,hogg 's only reason why the movie is being
1,after watching one season i could almost understand why a movie is not going anywhere it 's,after a lot while flipping around the room on screen you get to hear about it
1,we all have a very high standard of movies,we are not allowed to believe that the only thing
1,aman is the only girl he does,aman is a very good actor
1,here we have an excellent example of how far it can go,here the camera pans off to a point and it is very slow
1,the plot twists and the characters were completely different and had the same basic story that the movie does you wo n't have to,the movie is a bit short but very fun and very funny because of the cast which includes all the characters in it
1,a few minutes ago i got this movie on,a bit more credit is given to detail
1,more than anything i found this movie enjoyable and funny and the characters and actresses were good enough,more than a few episodes of this genre are not worth watching as a great tv series that does
1,this is a pretty lousy attempt at an independent film,this movie is n't about the human condition because it could
1,this is a very good action movie with excellent stunts by the great cast,this episode was so bad i was just stunned at how bad it was the
1,he had a huge part in the story line and he would make his life more difficult to follow,he 's an intelligent young man who does n't get a chance on the job of finding a new way
1,imperative to the world 's population of its own,imperative the movie is a little too boring
1,they are the perfect group of thieves who is able at being a,they did n't even try to hide the movie as a comedy
1,no one else could have done a better movie,no other actor could have made such crap
1,the acting could come out but at least he is given a few laughs while,the story was that of a young girl who lives in a tiny apartment
1,first off the acting in this movie is terrible and that 's what you 'd be,first of all the movie was a little boring and the ending was too abrupt
1,never once did it have a very bad movie,never really got off the ground of the story and
1,as soon a mystery of a relationship between two men as they could get the money to have the,as with most of its contemporaries i was expecting to know what the actors were trying to do
1,this is not one of those movies where i would like it so much that the movie was shot at one time or two in,this is another example to me that i ca n't understand why anyone would want this to make an attempt to watch a film
1,when i was in my youth when i was growing my dad is a little stiff,when the director of a classic show comes to a medium this one was a great one
1,thank you for providing a movie for those who enjoy a movie that shows how a movie could be and should be done so,thank god that the other reviews here have said that i think the filmmakers did not want to make an accurate statement about the real
1,the film is so bad that when the bad guy is going in and the other guy runs the hero he 's not really funny,the first thing they made was that there was no suspense no suspense at all in this film and it did n't really fit into
1,appearances are good and the movie 's direction is very good and well done although it 's somewhat dated,appearances have been given to the camera for posterity but the director was unable to achieve an interest
1,that 's not the only way to,that part was a bit odd
1,this is a story of a woman,this is one of my favorites
1,it just does show a great deal of,it is a pity to see it
1,this is just a poor excuse for an excuse to make,this is the most powerful portrayal i have ever heard
1,not one of his better movies but that is about the only redeeming factor in the film because,not a bad attempt at a spoof of the first but still it is a great show
1,watch it and you 'll be bored,watch it you wo n't get bored with
1,most people do have problems with their lives and their relationship but the way their relationship develops between them and their problems which are always interesting to watch in,most of the cast are very young and i could n't help but think that it was a mistake they are in many ways much better that way
1,to get into a car wreck and get on their way,to be fair it just is not a comedy movie
1,the whole cast crew is so wooden that you do n't,the plot of the book does not go smoothly astray
1,some people do have that kind that i think of a few other good,some of those elements of the film have been added to the movie
1,end of days this is one big disappointment movie,end spoilers you should never go watch this movie it
1,coke is a beautiful romantic comedy about a man who is driven,coke is an amazing film and it is not a comedy
1,he has a very funny character,he plays a young kid that kills
1,amanda bynes is very good as her character,amanda bynes was excellent as well and the movie
1,cotter is a very good movie,cotter is one to look at the
1,these scenes of both were pretty bad,these are all good films for me
1,the acting is poor and the plot does not help you make it a bad movie,the story is a little weak but the characters are very likable with each character
1,this is a really great movie with a,this film had nothing whatsoever to do
1,when all this fails i am very glad that,when i say there was some good gore
1,other than the fact it was so bad you could only get it done by some other person,other times you 'll get to the end that 's a real accomplishment for a filmmaker and i can
1,maybe you can go in for a great movie with a good cast,maybe the filmmakers forgot to hire the audience to suspend their own conclusions to
1,there are some funny moments but the story is n't so long,there are some really funny parts in this movie and that 's pretty
1,scrapped of course a great deal of money,scrapped is a movie of a sort
1,but that is all i can say about that,but then we get to the end of this film
1,davis' film was so bad it looked great at the time but,davis' only reason to be is to get a better movie
1,nor do there anyone else in this film actually made one iota,nor is there a reason for why this is the best
1,when the characters were introduced their characters to this movie were just too silly to realize,when this film was made and it was one of the few great scenes of the film
1,the film is about a woman who lives with a young man in a rural neighborhood,the characters have all sorts of personalities that would seem to be real and that 's why
1,titles are not so much in sync with a story of a young woman,titles like 'the green show' is one the best animated films of the last decade
1,on the other hand i think the problem with most movies like that is a total mockery in it 's depiction and is actually quite,on an interview with the other commentators and some of my personal favorites i thought that it would be a good movie to watch
1,i really do think the movie was a bit different than the others so it is a bit too long and the acting is so bad that i do n't think it was made into an oscar for the,i did n't care for the character of henry and who was n't in this but there was a lot more than that but the ending of the movie was so stupid that i really did n't care
1,what a waste for this film and for that i mean it,what 's more it is not as bad as the first
1,to sum up this film has the feel that made the first one more so,to be frank he did and the character of the lead character was just too much
1,like a bad man 's dream i can relate the story to the original text that it could have been,like many people who actually think that this movie is the first of many years for the genre it 's a
1,this is one of the best films i saw,this movie is an exercise in the world of movies
1,better luck to go see the original or watch it,better to be watched if you can get away from a
1,the acting is poor although some scenes are pretty well done but not for,the only reason this movie works is because of it 's bad direction
1,the script by neil gaiman was pretty lame,the plot line was great and the acting is
1,in fact the only reason i watched it was because,in this movie she plays a very good part
1,this was a very disappointing attempt by a film with a lot of the jokes from the earlier work,this is one movie that i would watch over and read if that 's a great combination of the two
1,douglass was an intelligent woman who had her heart,douglass 's direction is a delight to behold
1,in the end it makes us hate that more than one or two of you,in the end it seems almost like the film would have had more drama
1,the only thing missing was the performance of chris sarandon and that was a shame because he was so cute,the story is so thin that it is impossible to follow on a story and it does have a lot of
1,on the other side it 's the kind that people who want to get,on the other side of my mind i was looking in this movie
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this one was really bad but then i saw this one,if you 're looking to see a movie that 's actually interesting in the first place then that is the only
1,i love how they are going for the best of their endeavors but the film is very funny and has a couple,i do not want it to end as the worst movie that i 've seen and the worst thing for me
1,and for those of us who are just looking for something different to those who would appreciate,and the film is about a young woman trying to cope her mother and her father
1,however for those who like this movie like watching the movie i can,however the movie is too weak to be considered an action film
1,it 's a movie that is just awful,it had more depth than the movie could and
1,he 's the most annoying person in this movie,he then decides he needs to do some more and
1,and that 's how we get in our eyes,and this is one of the few movies
1,as a result of a good movie that has been seen and praised,as soon as a war occurs she goes to a hospital to rescue a
1,unfortunately they are so good they were both funny,unfortunately this movie had been shot by the other people
1,soon i was a bit reluctant to find it 's own but it seems to be a lot of,soon after this one goes to show the world how he can take his mother away from prison
1,clearly the movie is about how the characters react and interact each other and so many others are completely wrong as they say,clearly if that was n't bad enough there is some kind that really happens in the movie so it 's almost unbelievable to sit
1,it is n't as though they 're being a good example to be an american movie that has,it is a bit of like this film and it will make the viewer laugh and cry
1,the only good acting job is john ritter who delivers the best performance of the film and he 's one of them he is the only,the characters are well written the story a good and funny take on comedy and the music to the film that plays the young generation
1,i had never read about this piece of work since renting it and have only one thing to do,i just got sucked into this movie as i had n't seen a movie so that i do n't see
1,david schwimmer is also the best actor in the movie,david bradley is good but the rest of us did n't
1,when this film came out i had to get to it and was very disappointed,when the movie is over and you have a good director 's dream you get that
1,so many of these films are so bad it 's good,so we have to have been there in the world around him
1,i have watched a few of her movies i think i 've seen all others as well,i do n't think that the first film had a chance to do it but the two are
1,for some reason i just did not like the movie,for fans of the classic films of the 30s or the
1,escape to paris is a story about a group,escape to me is a fun horror movie
1,this movie has some great acting and i would n't have it been better spent seeing the movie as a child 's play or if it would be on the imdb a day for a rental,this movie just does n't have much to it but it is one that could 've been a lot worse and would have been a good movie instead of an hour and forty minute short
1,while the movie is a bit slow in the beginning it drags and drags at the end and the end,while it 's not an easy movie to watch and a great one at that it 's a must
1,i was not surprised at how bad it was,i am sorry but i really hate them and will
1,every aspect is so easy to understand the world of today 's culture,every time we hear him yell at the girl he has been stabbed off
1,i was in my old junior at the time to see the movie and i do n't,i had n't read any of the other reviews and did n't expect it to come
1,i think this movie was one big disappointment,i was shocked that the film had the advantage
1,i was n't impressed by the ending at the very least because they seemed so forced and tacked on,i had never thought of the film but after seeing a few of them they could n't seem a complete
1,dave was in the past for a couple weeks and the next morning he 's forced to take,dave and his friends are all over and they can get them to see and hear people
1,ok it has that kind from me as is probably in my,ok we get to see this film for a first time
1,i have no choice in saying it but i have to admit that this movie was just a waste of time but it is worth a watch,i had not heard about it beforehand because i have heard it was n't that bad but it was the worst movie that this movie was released
1,while there were no other characters the whole time i was left laughing with laughter and the acting seemed to be just a bit bit overdone to watch and a little irritating,while i thought the idea was quite promising and had the potential of being one of my favourite horror films and the last few years of 'the adventures in the valley there was
1,the only good points are two the film is,the ending of the movie is quite abrupt
1,they are obviously a lot of fun to look forward to,they even make the film to be a good one
1,he is a young man named krishna and his daughter,he 's been done with great sensitivity and flair
1,however i can not say how i think about this,however it is n't the best of the bunch
1,plus it is the worst of the series,plus it 's not a typical movie at all
1,i do n't know why but i 'll give it three out 10,i was surprised that the director chose to take me so much to read
1,but as soon you know you 're going a bad film you ca would,but this is the first time you see a woman dressed in black
1,the only reason for watching it,the film seems very interesting to me
1,i do not really understand why so many americans find this offensive,i do n't think that the only thing good in any one of
1,i had read the book and had seen the original film a few months ago,i did n't feel that the story needed any more than it did with the book
1,the story of the characters is based so on the same themes that we do n't know or care about the characters that you have,the characters all do their best to be a little likable when they do n't even appear to be in there as a whole
1,a great performance from a director called a great actor,a couple hundred yearolds on the run get a hold up
1,the whole thing is a dream,the main character is the one who
1,i 've never seen a film so bad storywise,i am a little jaded about this movie
1,he 's just a guy with a chip a tail,he is a very talented character in the book
1,it 's not just about the story it just is,it 's all the more effective to this point
1,the film 's plot takes more than just some twists and turns to make you feel like the story is going to be as entertaining as we get and that 's,the acting was pretty good and the plot was good to the point where you would think there was an element of reality but the plot was n't much better
1,aside the best part of the film is that they are not able to be very interesting and are just not worth bothering in and,aside from that it was really great fun that 's what it would be and i have no idea why it 's a movie
1,tom berenger and his gang of friends are all in the same frame as the one who is a master of,tom 's character and his wife are just a bit more believable as each person in this film is likable
1,well the acting was n't good and i was expecting that i would have done much better,well this is a very well made movie that was released on video and i hope to watch
1,there are also many interesting scenes,there must be some people who are
1,however a true story about one person,however i was n't quite impressed i did
1,no doubt the director is n't a filmmaker,no one could tell him how to act and
1,in this movie i would say that this was a low budget,in the end i found this to have more interesting information than a
1,you 'd be more concerned about that if,you have been warned of the story
1,rent it you will never regret anything that is,rent it if you have nothing else watch
1,a lot more interesting than many of the other comments i 've,a movie from the past decade is the first and so
1,note of the title says that the movie 's biggest strength is to be a very good one and should,note he has the talent of his own self which he is the very best actor in the history
1,however it was so bad that he could even have pulled,however it is n't even the case of that film
1,and in the process a young lady has not done well to make a living,and then the story is about how things turn out so quickly and then abruptly become
1,probably because the film is a satire of how a film can get,probably the only reason i did n't give the movie a 1 was the
1,all of these people did a very convincing,all of the actors seem very real
1,that 's how bad this show was i would n't bother to go,that 's a good thing because he is so much more entertaining
1,i am a huge fan and the only thing good i found this was the lack in some of you,i had to watch it to see if it was a bad movie or a bad attempt at humor and some
1,that 's not to be expected,that was a lot less than i
1,the movie just makes a lot more sense and i 've seen this in a very bad sense,the cast is very good especially from the late isaac blore as if you 're from an early age
1,she was the only character who was remotely believable and is,she 's not exactly the best woman at a nightclub
1,the only person i can think of was one of them who had a good career but he was not even so good at his role of a man who knew nothing of,the only one who gets involved with the mob is his son alex and they are trying to steal the missing ones from the old man the dead bodies his own daughter
1,his work is a complete waste,his character is one big fat liar
1,i do n't really think that in the,i ca n't wait to view that
1,i am a huge admirer and this film is so underrated for fans but it is definitely more than a little disappointing,i was really excited to find out that it was going to be on a par as in the first place in my
1,this is a film that is a great example,this movie had me guessing the story of the characters
1,best movie you have ever seen in an asian film,best of his career in my book was the last kiss
1,highlight the acting which was not the worst thing in the movie but i would n't want to waste any,highlight the movie and you 'll find it hard to watch and it 's also fun to laugh at
1,for those who like a bit of romance or humor the humor is quite dry,for the film i am a big fan of movies that take a while for the
1,this is another story which is supposed as a psychological,this was just another bad mistake in the movie
1,movies do not have a great deal to them but,movies such classics as the ones that were popular
1,when we watch a lot and it is a good example of the kind of film,when this is the worst movie he ever made the camera pans out and does so
1,then he meets with a friend who turns into an idiot,then again maybe there is a difference between these three men and
1,first let your life go you 're all about you being an idiot,first of all the film is just bad with the annoying dialog coming down
1,bauer 's son 's character is the,bauer is the only real highlight
1,however the real problem with this is the plot,however they have to be at his worst
1,as a result we have a few moments of the movie,as a director myself the movie was shot in the seventies
1,i 've never had a chance to watch the show again because there is so little else,i could n't stop thinking about this movie i had to stop and watch it again
1,this is the best of the series,this movie had a great cast with a
1,definitely a must for for those who love this genre,definitely one thing i would consider that i could have done
1,by the time all the characters in this,by any means is a good movie
1,but if you are looking for something like a comedy you are missing some of it,but the fact that a story can never be told is one thing to make a movie
1,this is the worst film of all time but this is a bad movie it,this movie is a complete mess on many levels but it 's just not
1,still the movie has an interesting premise and is n't bad,still this story has a much needed meaning in it that i
1,even after the first 20 minutes or so i was n't able,even though they are so much more than their usual action movies they
1,amanda peet is excellent as the mother and son and mother,amanda bynes has no idea where to go with her or not
1,i 've never heard of anyone who sees this,i do not remember that being a movie
1,paul haggis 's films are very easy,paul rudd stars in these episodes
1,opposing of a plot is the fact i liked the movie,opposing reality is about love and the beast of the city is
1,plot points are left unexplained the viewer is n't going for a gripping ending the climax is so obvious,plot wise it 's an example to be a little more of a parody of a tv series
1,all the things that i liked the most,all the actors seemed to have had a fun
1,had a hard earned role in the movie but i would n't be surprised by this movie if i could only have,had he just been given a chance at all the talent he got on the phone he wanted to kill him
1,this is the type of comedy that was made by john carpenter,this movie was made and it was probably a little too heavy for
1,in addition to the success i have to say,in a nutshell this was the worst movie ever
1,why did a good book like that,why did he do such a thing
1,i have a few problems with this show,i was n't even sure what to feel after
1,i do not think that 's the only reason i did n't,i was not aware of the way this movie did end
1,on some level they seem to be too long with some of the other things a little bit of violence,on the other part if you have ever read anything else it is a very simple and touching movie
1,also there would not be a scene in which the,also there are two things that make it worse
1,the script is not the best,the actors were so bad that there
1,maybe it did not make sense,maybe this show was the only one
1,if a man is an object of the city and the man he knows that he could be a good choice for this film he has to,if only the film itself was a little more entertaining but alas it was not so much in the acting department as it could have had
1,true to my life i was really,true it 's not all good
1,but i guess i did not feel as,but that 's just not my kind
1,i ca only have enjoyed watching more of the other two films in my life,i have seen several people and i have to say this movie was n't even nominated
1,it was an entertaining movie to see,it was an insult to my intelligence and
1,her character is a caricature for the part of the audience and she 's a good person,her acting style is great the actress who plays the girl is quite good but she does not
1,each character is played and i do hope you 'll,each episode was a little different to any other
1,in fact all these years i was hoping for more movies like the one to choose which i did,in my opinion i could have done better by the time i saw him in the role of jesus
1,it is very rare to find a movie that,it really gets me right in with it
1,the first thing that really got me was that it was supposed to,the movie is based on an actual classic novel by christopher lee
1,indeed i can honestly feel for the characters for their lives,indeed he 's not the worst of this group and this is
1,who is a man who enjoys the life for those who hate all the others,who would think a little girl would be a lesbian in this world but this is
1,the acting and direction are excellent although i 've seen some really awful,the film is based on the events that go on with it
1,in fact one can only be thankful for a couple and a half to be found in the middle,in the end it 's a bit like the first time i saw it the second time i saw the
1,let 's get this straight from the first scene,let us get a few lines on the film
1,yet for the majority of us i would not have bothered watching that the two guys would get in and be more,yet i do feel that this story was so contrived and poorly made that it was impossible to watch the film
1,this movie is so bad that it 's hard not for it to make this,this may be the worst movie i have seen i would like to see
1,the acting was good but the direction was just so awful,the movie itself was very entertaining i was so very excited to
1,if you are looking to get the wrong movie that the movie offers you,if you love action and adventure movies this will be much more enjoyable
1,if the writers were n't making a sequel to it i would definitely want to give it a chance,if this was the best they could for a young boy in the film he 's very funny
1,all i can say about the acting this,all of it is done very well
1,it 's about a young woman in an old apartment and she is not the typical teenage,it 's a shame that this movie never got released on video and it 's one of those
1,i do not think the filmmakers could have made one 's own films,i really do n't understand why they were n't trying too much
1,however i did n't want to see a good film,however it was a big disappointment on its terms which kept
1,oh dear oh god that 's really cool,oh yeah yeah there 's a lot of things
1,gus van dyke is perfect as a woman and the only character of a person,gus 's direction is the best i 've had ever encountered on a television film in
1,it is just that the director never gets out to get the,it would be interesting to have to give it more thought
1,you 'd think that this would be a good movie for kids,you ca n't possibly tell how bad i was but i have watched
1,but he does n't seem like a character,but it still holds up very close
1,despite their obvious problems i 've been a little uneasy to admit that i found a lot of this kind about what it was and who is responsible,despite their flaws and the script by the way it is a bit too talky to get across the screen it was n't the first one to make up
1,the movie is about a family man called nadja the mother a young and younger boy named amir,the movie has the power it feels like it 's a real life story about a family that is
1,news park is an excellent film,news reports were never shown in real
1,i would n't have given up watching any of the previous seasons,i was looking through this movie and was expecting something more like it
1,the first half of the film takes an intriguing turn in which we 're dealing with the characters and,the cast includes richard conte john cusack george romero and the lovely patricia clarkson as the young stud
1,maybe a very small budget must have a low quality and a lot of money and some of my friends would like something else,maybe it is that the filmmakers have their work to make up a few films that are supposed to be a little over the top
1,i 've never seen a movie where these characters have such depth that,i did n't really care much at some level of my own
1,an hour and fifteen year later the film is,an interesting movie in itself as a movie
1,this is a wonderful film and i love it for the fact that it made me want me to say that the best part of this film has a lot to say,this is one of a few films that i have seen with a very bad reputation as an actor and not in this particular role although it has been a little too much
1,its a great story and an intriguing one at that is the most unexpected ending,its about a man who thinks of his father as a kind murderer but instead his
1,just remember the movie that was made in the past of the late 60s the movie follows two young people who get to love,just remember it was a film that seemed more like an extended documentary than a documentary about the lives of a new group
1,will smith make the best he has on the whole,will anyone who has actually heard of the plot of this
1,the only person i remember was the guy who was playing the character of the first time around,the ending is just as bad as the rest of them which just makes you think you do yourself
1,a couple months later the girl who has the,a group and their crew have been killed
1,the acting was bad especially the two leads they play very badly on the screen the movie is pretty good but in the very first half it,the story of the two sons who live in a small apartment in the countryside of the country where they were told is so much fun
1,although the film 's plot had the potential needed to be said,although the film lacks of suspense it lacks the usual elements that most
1,he 's so much better than he is,he has just a few seconds of screen presence
1,i ca do n't even have a good review,i just saw this movie in the early 1950 another
1,the story involves a man who falls in his element with a strange man and then is rescued by a powerful figure who has a secret and he gets lost in a murder mystery,the movie is set in england in a very distant location of london and the music was fantastic in the music but it is quite beautiful and it is nice to hear her speak from
1,on the whole it 's a pretty good movie,on this one the actors and actresses were not professionals
1,the music is very bad too but the acting the script and the special effects,the acting is very bad and i did n't expect much in a movie to have
1,when she was in a coma i knew i was in for a real story,when a man dies and she does n't have her blood cut he is able and
1,or if he does what we do in our hero you know that this is a movie for anyone,or the most exciting moment in this whole movie was when they were trying desperately hard to escape
1,from the moment it turns out to have a real meaning at a moment where a film is supposed to get interesting the viewer finds themselves as the viewer are asked,from the opening sequence of the film when we are watching the movie you 'll be a little confused to know that it is a great film it is the best thing
1,and this was one of those rare shows that was so bad i could n't see,and it does n't help that there 's not a lot of action in this
1,while this movie was n't good the acting was just awful and the writing is awful at being horrible in fact it 's the funniest of the movie that is,while it is somewhat difficult and so easy to understand to be fair i felt it was a pretty good movie to view a movie like i 'd say
1,please not only watch this series and it 's a complete waste of time and money on all,please do n't take this movie seriously and watch it on a shelf with all my friends and i
1,that 's because of the fact that this was the best movie ever,that 's just not what you can call this a good thriller it 's
1,no doubt it is a film to watch and will,no one in the cast is a good actor
1,but for all the good parts and the good guy he is not bad,but then we have to wait to get a better start to see the sequel
1,generally this story is just a rehash,generally for this movie the acting was awful
1,it 's just too bad and boring to be a classic,it 's an interesting story but is not a bad one
1,i had never heard anyone was watching a,i ca n't think of worse films
1,also the film is a bit of hard to digest because the movie,also a lot more action and more action than in this one
1,i ca all about what the film was trying to say and i ca just congratulate myself with the rest the people and most other christians on the show are just plain stupid and,i saw this movie at sundance a week ago and it is the worst movie ever filmed and it 's a pity that the filmmakers did n't even manage to make something interesting
1,then there are those in the audience,then we see him in bed
1,mastroianni 's character who makes it all his own,mastroianni has been in his prime for years
1,same with the original the story of a girl,same movie is about some great action sequences
1,the only reason i have seen this series of people who have to see it to is the last one and the,the film also is a very interesting piece of work that should be shown with a larger collection of likeminded audiences
1,the only saving grace for me were in the trailer the fact it was a made for comedy movie,the story itself was so bad it could hardly have been made in any way shape or form at some
1,but the script by richard david and the cast has a great time when it 's made for a very good story,but even if the movie has such a strong cast i 'd probably have to endure it with a friend who did an
1,seven feet tall and nine minutes later you have to,seven years later this one has to be seen
1,amusingly the film is a good example of a really bad film,amusingly i think that they were in a better place for each of
1,sure he 's got it as good as a film and as an actor he is so good that you wonder but even his performance,sure the first two were not exactly bad but it 's a lot better than the first and is definitely not a good thing
1,the first half of these episodes are so bad they 're even fun to,the movie is set in a futuristic setting which is not very original
1,how can they possibly have been so desperate by this movie,how could we get so much into the film business
1,but the film is a bit slow in parts and does not help matters,but this movie is about a young girl who is sent from a mental institution
1,oh yea i have heard more how many movies have done with a few hundred bucks of varying budget and so,oh how the hell is that so funny you ca only to say the acting is bad the story sucks
1,it could have done better with more of the same but it 's the fact we never find it anywhere in,it 's just that it could have been a bit more original or perhaps more of an exploration in history
1,it 's as if the director of photography is trying something more as a metaphor for a film but in the final analysis it does n't matter what,it 's so predictable it could have done it justice if the film was made to give us a real insight into the personalities of the characters
1,so many questions about it are answered the fact that the entire story is an unbelievable attempt to cash in at the end,so if you really want to watch a movie where the viewer is treated with a lot of gore the acting is great you
1,the only thing missing was the lack name and a little of it,the whole thing is just a bunch or movie like a movie that was
1,despite the poor acting and direction,despite its downfalls the film is still
1,when i saw this movie i was a little bit harsh in the theater i was going out of business with this film,when we finally get on it and see it i thought the movie was quite good in that way and not really in my
1,i thought he was in a very bad shape,i do n't think that you are watching a movie
1,the first film was good i was n't expecting it to happen,the only redeeming feature is the presence of the young actress
1,it is n't just a movie or a comedy but a documentary and a funny one,it has to be the worst movie i can think of since seeing it i think it
1,but the rest is just not good,but even though i 've heard that the
1,i saw this movie yesterday and thought this could have come as a comedy,i was a teenager in the late 1980 's and early 1980 like the first
1,dr the oldest son of the sheik is,dr seuss 's score is a classic
1,to those of all ages that they 're not to look like that it 's a very bad idea,to my surprise this is a very funny episode with little twists or surprises so i ca only say that
1,if you 're not a fan of the comics and you 'll want to see one of them do something else you will,if they 're going for a different movie to make an interesting movie that would be a waste of time or something
1,i was n't expecting a much more indepth movie,i am a big burt wood fan or a b
1,the movie is full of action and action packed action,the story is a bit complicated and the director is trying
1,she is as the ultimate gift for,she 's a real estate actress
1,there seems so much time devoted with the movie in the end,there seems to be a lot of issues and there are so many
1,what 's the deal in the first place for the next couple of minutes or so,what we have here is a poor movie that tries to cash in on its predecessor
1,what the filmmakers think of is that it was a movie with such a,what i got was the story about some of its most powerful ideas
1,i was hoping this could be a,i do n't mind the movie
1,in this movie he gives a great amount as an actor who is a fine fighter,in addition to the movie it 's one of many and the movies that i saw
1,ricco and his friend of three musketeers have a new life as an engineer for them,ricco is the most irritating movie i have ever watched so far that it is not a
1,but even so the whole film is so predictable as to make one,but this is a movie that i can watch over a weekend
1,every single actor has a cameo role that is to come,every time i watch the whole thing and i can tell some
1,he just seemed like a director,he is so convincing in the role
1,what the heck is this movie about in,what a treat to see the movie
1,not so one for the first time in life,not to mention the acting the bad script the plot
1,it is a movie that i do n't know,it 's not just a simple love affair between men
1,it is a film about a young young woman who is,it 's like a cross between the first and last
1,the plot in the movie is simple and not too complicated,the plot and story are pretty bad but it 's very funny
1,however this is n't the kind we have,however that being a bit too bad i was
1,well i am the only person who can appreciate it,well i do n't know how the producers managed this movie
1,with the exception of an excellent score that includes some of the worst films ever made and is the worst of all the,with that said this movie could n't have done more wrong because it 's too stupid or the way it was made
1,the first 15 minutes are a little more than a little too long for the drama,the film is based entirely on the first movie and is actually an homage of sorts
1,i think that 's what it is and the director really wanted a sequel,i did n't like that it has a lot more than an hour running time
1,this is a very entertaining film,this movie is a classic and i
1,it 's just one more of them,it 's like a play to a movie
1,the film has been set about a year ago and i,the story is simple and the action keeps you entertained
1,also the soundtrack is very nice,also there are lots more action sequences
1,from the moment the movie starts i can feel it,from the very young man that is the main character i
1,you know i was not going for the most,you could n't see the actors of course
1,if you 're looking for a film that makes you care about the plot this movie,if you like movies this is for you and will always enjoy seeing this one
1,this film is so awful that it makes me laugh at the stupidity of the word,this film also made me think of the first thing that could have been great
1,timothy trotta is a wonderful director and writer,timothy dalton is not very much a good villain
1,the film is set on a remote barge and we find out that the movie is set by the,the plot was simple but all told it needed to take more to the story and the characters
1,they are the only ones to really give a,they are the same as the other ones
1,connery plays a woman in a small brooklyn building where he is given,connery plays the part with an intensity and is a great actor
1,david lynch is the best of the lot,david bradley 's first film on the contrary of
1,plus the cast members have some real talent as the film,plus this movie is a good example of how all of these
1,whilst it is not an entirely original movie it has no real story,whilst he 's in the army and then is a big fat guy
1,a movie where nothing is a little scary and is more entertaining than this,a group of scientists who live together on a spaceship are stranded at night in
1,luckily this is a real stinker,luckily for me i have to say
1,the plot involves two children and two young children,the film is n't even bad to watch
1,first the movie was boring and did,first it was a good movie
1,phoebe is an independent film star,phoebe and her brother 's wife are
1,in the end it is a real waste of time and money but there 's plenty of fun,in one scene the girl takes her clothes on and says that he wants a new life
1,that 's when the movie starts to roll on,that was a huge mistake of this movie
1,she also plays a young woman who is in her own and has n't seen her,she is a fine actor and i can tell you that this movie was made up of
1,that was n't the only way why,that 's a good thing but i found
1,with a cast that would never have been the perfect guy' for a role in the series as well they would still have a little too,with that i did and even though the original was not that bad as an adult i can still recommend this to the little kids
1,i was surprised and entertained at the number of people involved in it but it is very difficult to understand that these women are all very good friends and if we want an accurate lifestyle they,i ca n't really give anything away but a good movie nonetheless is very good with excellent acting from the actors and it has a lot more going of it than in the first one
1,this is one example why the show 's title is so much fun when all of the characters in this film,this movie is not funny and not a real movie and definitely the worst movie i 've seen in years
1,this is a film for all ages,this movie is one of the most important
1,so do the people who make movies of these films with the same characters as their characters in films like serpico and jurassic africa with their deepest rules,so when she is going through the film she is the only thing the guy in the room who was willing by her and she has to be at
1,the plot and story are interesting enough as to the outcome of this movie,the film is about a young woman who marries her husband and is sent down
1,or when this movie did n't work,or perhaps i will be disappointed
1,part of it be that there are so bad in this,part of me was the little kid and the girl
1,she 's not a woman and she does a,she does n't do much in the movie
1,from the beginning the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to either,from start to finish this is a pretty entertaining movie worth seeing the first 30
1,michael keaton is a real actor not a real good guy although he does not have a,michael is as good looking and cool and it 's all he did for the role
1,simple enough that i 've never heard that before i did n't have anything,simple characters but all it needs for them to be a good story
1,i could n't believe the director 's name attached the film to a new level and i have to say it did not,i would highly recommend that a great deal of people watch this film and you wo n't be disappointed to find out
1,and in fact there is no real explanation to that in the movie,and that is not to have enough to be a big disappointment
1,cartman is also very likable in this film,cartman gets the money to spend a good amount
1,my guess this is an example to a film about a serial killer a serial killer killer with a beard and a,my friend was a good looking boy but was a great deal and a little too late for his own good
1,do we like this so much,do not watch it it 's a
1,it has to have a lot to work out from the rest of my classmates i am not even trying to explain why the whole,it 's a very good movie and it is a shame the bbc version of it was n't so much better known and better
1,compelled me to say it is an insult to the great actors and not just the beautiful but sincere and the,compelled in the film industry that he has to make a new series to play with him and his parents
1,let the viewer see what 's going for a man like maude eburne,let me tell you how bad this movie truly is i think the movie
1,this is a truly great family film and i do n't know how,this is probably the worst piece of cinematic crap in cinematic memory
1,to me this is one of the most underrated movies i saw this year,to be sure there are plenty of great actors including anthony hopkins who has done
1,the story involves a girl who lives in a small apartment,the director and the actors are very well done though
1,insights to love him and his wife,insights is not a bad film
1,keira knightly was good as the mother,keira knightly plays his father well and it
1,i think it was the best movie that made it in years a day,i have to say that i was very impressed with this and i was really
1,no one was able to act,no wonder this movie is n't a
1,what you have here one is the worst of all,what 's it with a man who loves all sorts and
1,it has a story that will leave you guessing to tears in your eyes and not just by the inconvenience of those who love them and are,it is a pity that there is no justification to see what the producers were looking forward to the original movie but it never does improve
1,the only redeeming feature in this movie is the soundtrack and the fact it 's an action film,the main reason why i rented was one of many of those years of a good chunk of it
1,it 's so bad so laughable that it 's difficult for a film like this,it 's like watching a train wreck with a car full of holes and no one
1,then in this movie i found her role,then the movie starts to end happily
1,definitely a movie for those interested in history and it is n't,definitely because of the acting and the script there was no story
1,the characters get better the more the characters and characters seem more real,the story of the famous american navy in the west during a storm and
1,in the book the writer tries too much to add depth to the movie without any regard to the other characters,in the first of two films this one is really about a man who gets an idea of his own life and
1,in one scene the woman says that she 's a whore and she is on fire but it 's a very important thing that she has,in the end i thought it had potential but it was a disappointment because all of them were just so funny and so damn cute and funny
1,but the film is full of clichs and some really good dialogs,but there are so many reasons why this is the perfect vehicle for
1,like all films the script was so lame it hurts me,like many other countries from my generation i 've seen the whole
1,unless the film does not know the facts of a movie like one and,unless you have n't read the book i 'd suggest you read this
1,however the movie is just boring,however if there 's an abundance to
1,they were in fact the most disgusting,they make this movie very interesting
1,having said anything positive about this movie i will just say that i loved the film,having a child and a girl on a trip she is not afraid to let the world
1,but i was n't impressed with the movie,but what we get is a film that never
1,it is a very enjoyable movie and the acting was great as well as,it 's just a good movie with no plot and really good acting
1,however it 's also very hard not for the actors who are n't convincing at all and it 's obvious they were supposed to have a good,however in the end she has been treated as if it 's been a long time and she is able to do something with her character
1,pranks and the occasional flashes of gore,pranks have a lot of action
1,unfortunately for me that was one thing to describe this movie to those who like the book because we do not know how,unfortunately the film 's failure is the result of the lack that a story could really be made in the first place
1,she does n't need to take a drink to make her laugh,she is an accomplished woman that is trying to survive the murder
1,yvonne is just a girl with a bad temper,yvonne is a beautiful actress who is very convincing as
1,maybe a few days ago she was born in a car crash or the house where it had,maybe it would be nice for the kids who were n't to die for this stupid crap
1,michael dudikoff was a perfect director,michael pare is excellent as the cop
1,in short it is the worst movie i 've ever seen,in a few words that 's not saying i was not
1,ford is an interesting actor and is so much in love with her and so,ford was also good at playing the role of a lifetime of the time
1,also the way the plot unfolds are n't a lot like that of the book with this is n't a surprise,also when a young boy 's mother died and was told to make it a real life in the first place the
1,it was a little bit overdone and was n't much of,it 's like a bunch of idiots trying at school
1,this movie could have been good but nothing else it was n't a film,this is the first of several sequels that i have to deal with
1,however if you 're going for this kind of humor i guess you should,however as a kid i 've only seen a few of the others
1,yeah it 's a bit corny and silly but if you like the kind i ca n't help but feel that it is,yeah it is the worst film ever made on my mind and it 's just that bad taste for it 's own
1,she 's a fine actress and her portrayal,she was very sexy in her life
1,but the film does not offer a lot of good things on stage and to put it all together i 'd say if you have an extra,but i think this is a very interesting film that is very difficult to do with that kind of film or is n't a bad movie
1,wolf and the whale is an interesting and entertaining comedy about a young woman who moves across an isolated mansion to find her,wolf was an old and very boring movie with only the names but it was very much like a typical movie like pulp fiction
1,damon is also funny when a man who is in his position has a secret to the head when his mother dies,damon was a little more than a little stiff at first but he seemed to be enjoying a pretty fun film
1,this is a movie for the viewer,this is a film that will never be
1,if you have the right frame of humor i would suggest this movie for all but the bad guys,if you 're looking for an edgy film with an engaging story and an excellent cast a great story line
1,and the plot is ridiculous the acting horrible and the plot is a joke at times,and when you do n't see any of that it is n't enough and i would rather
1,scarlett is also a strong character and she is a good actor and is not a great dancer but she,scarlett and her brother 's sister and their friends are the ones they meet and the movie is told
1,some of these elements are pretty bad but there are some very enjoyable,some people seem a good idea and this movie is no exception
1,the only good thing is the performances of patrick mcgoohan,the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and
1,in other words it is an excellent movie that will,in this one the acting was pretty good too
1,this is not the type of film you 'd have seen on the,this film was so bad it could not have been any worse
1,i think i have read a book of the book,i have not seen the original play of jane christie 's
1,they 're trying the same way the first act ended,they 've been living in the past of nowhere from the
1,eleanor 's direction does n't do anything,eleanor parker was a fine actress
1,can i possibly have a copy that will leave the film theater,can be the only reason i have this movie is because if i
1,the acting of the actors is very good,the movie has a lot going on
1,the director of this story has created something like that for a few,the acting is bad and there are continuity limitations to get through
1,we get a couple scenes of the film with the girls getting the girl on the road and they are pretty well done in their final scene,we 're supposed for a film and they are just not that memorable but it makes for a great experience for a very short time period and for
1,valjean is sent to a remote jail to locate the land of,valjean 's attempt is the most difficult part in my life
1,5 the story is simple and it was,5 the only thing that gets worse
1,the story was really bad and the acting from the leads is bad,the film opens the door with the inevitable death of two of us and
1,with the first one of this,with the exception the director had been
1,there are a few instances that will make sense to all that is n't,there are many good scenes in this but you have to watch it to appreciate
1,at one stage he was a quiet guy who is a little rough and he has,at some point in this flick i was hoping the whole scene would be interesting
1,i'm sure the producers could have been,i'm glad i watched it all
1,bad editing good plot bad bad acting the,bad film bad direction and bad acting
1,hitchcock did make an appearance with a great deal to go,hitchcock 's film is a mustsee for its historical content
1,4 the story is about a group of college students who want to kill a few people,4 it is n't a horror film in a sense of the word that it takes for people
1,not a very bad name just to attract the viewer with what the director thought was doing the book to the viewers as it was so the film itself was just bad,not because they are too happy but because he is one that 's not the most interesting aspect of the film which is really something like the other films that made it to
1,okay it has got to have a good plot,okay so i was n't expecting a lot of bad
1,once the film gets on the run it 's easy,once there irreversible the movie started at that time
1,you can tell this is going to be a spoof of a tv series but it is so incredibly awful that i just could n't care enough,you see this movie is not so bad that it 's funny as hell though the acting is n't bad it 's pretty decent and the story makes
1,scott wiper is not a perfect actor but his character is well developed as the rest of the movie as the character gets involved,scott 's acting in the other film was the best part of the movie but at that it did n't seem to be quite clear
1,when it 's first time around the film makes no sense,when there was a scene at a club it was filmed on
1,and the plot was just too predictable too boring to be enjoyable because it would,and there is some of them that do n't add anything to the movie
1,or the scene in which i will be humming a song to the screen,or the scene involving the one with no explanation is the one in this
1,this may well have had the makings needed for a better life for this movie that would have made,this was one time when it came the second season of columbo 's season and was the result
1,i do not understand why everyone involved here,i 've heard a few other negative comment but
1,what is with the other films,what is most amusing is that the
1,hera pheri does a great rendition of,hera pheri is a great film
1,it would be nice to see a more talented actor and a woman who did n't get more from me as well and for this film it,it 's not that i do not want a few scenes that have to do without a doubt this is the most beautiful piece ever made
1,the main reason why this movie was so good for me was because i loved a lot of this film and i,the acting is excellent especially the two sisters who are all very convincing and i think that 's why it works
1,if you like watching movies or not i do see that it has to make,if that sounds unfair in the first place it 's a big step down
1,examples of the movie as a tribute between a lot of films and the other one and a great one for its unflinching depiction of the lives of a bunch,examples of other movies in that the same thing has been done in the original movies but it is also a very entertaining film and should make for a better film
1,this is a very good show with the right amount of humor,this is n't a movie you want to be sure to hate
1,i think if you were not paying attention in the end that i would n't be so disgusted as to watch it,i do like these two guys i have never met before but it was one of the most ridiculous i 've ever seen
1,funny moments are when they are trying their,funny how bad a movie can get
1,he is an artist and is a compulsive observer,he was the best man and it was his best
1,there 's even a small part where the movie is so terrible that it is laughable and not,there 's a great cast that is not always on the big scale but with their performances
1,alberto la la putain is set against it 's turbulent and it is n't a film that is set in the present or echelons,alberto de vaca is the perfect embodiment of a film which is a lot better than it was but that 's saying something
1,however it 's really a pretty nice idea,however as a matter the movie 's biggest draw
1,we were supposed the type of movie that 's not only a little too predictable,we also find out a lesson in a new life a young woman who 's in
1,on the upside however the story is a bit too old to,on my own show the two actors did a fine work
1,one of the most interesting films ever made,one of my favorite movies of all time
1,it is n't the best movie you can call it,it 's not an issue of the kind of film it
1,ted 's mother is so obviously the mother that he cannot do anything for him because he believes that they are the only ones,ted talbot is the only actor who is able in a way to get the audience interested in the story of this man
1,closed minded for your own lives of the characters you have,closed is an excellent movie and one of my favorites
1,our heroine is a stripper of the age who is not going to be the,our heroine has never seen anything from such a young actress in the field
1,it 's as predictable if not better known in the,it is the most boring character in television history
1,see it as a film if you like that,see if you are a true fan like me who
1,i had to write this review because it 's a classic with a very strong and thoughtprovoking performance,i do n't really know what to do with this film because it 's too hard to be a
1,this is why i have never been so disappointed,this is a good film but not bad
1,i did n't enjoy this show it was more or more a complete mess of the,i ca n't see how anyone could make a movie this much of a movie
1,ginger rogers was great as the wife,ginger snaps and john krasinski have been married
1,but i have n't read the novel nor have read the,but the real reason to see it was the acting
1,then we see this in its own,then it takes a different approach
1,he is the best actor in the movie and he is quite convincing,he does have that exact and the character development makes no effort as long
1,it 's about the world of a new jersey in the early 1980 another and as a result,it 's a movie that tries to show you the life but is still a little bit
1,at one point he meets in the bathroom scene where he has his wife and dad and then he is,at least i have n't seen the trailer but i have to say that it does n't mean much
1,there is a very subtle scene towards my friend and one of the two priests in a coffee factory,there were some funny scenes in which the main actors are just so cute that they all laughed so much
1,they all play in a very different way,they 're not so much more interesting than this
1,the story is simple at best,the director has done something that does
1,the acting the directing all of the characters,the movie is very boring but in its context
1,the main problem was that there was,the movie is a bit long
1,bring this one out with it,bring to mind another man who is
1,just when you thought he 'd do,just do so on the spot
1,what makes it so funny and why does it have so much violence to it that it makes no sense,what a disappointment this is in the first place the story line was so awful and the actors are n't believable
1,the film 's director is so full to provoke an emotional attachment to a film where he can be so much more than he,the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of two is the fact it has been on imdb so much time
1,it 's not like the first film or better or worse the second was the,it was a great movie for kids and children and it is very entertaining
1,i am also the kind of person who would,i would never even get into the story
1,i do n't know who the hell was,i really enjoyed this movie so much i wanted
1,and i mean come on the ending has everything that was going on,and that 's when it 's not the only movie that i think about
1,ok so i had an okay idea to start with the movie,ok i am pretty tired of this film and its a good story
1,the acting is excellent but not that bad,the script is not a good one
1,this is a pretty good movie,this is the second sequel to the
1,i just did so by the way the story was made,i was so intrigued at the story and the storyline
1,starting with the fact the film is being filmed in,starting with the film is set in new orleans
1,for a movie that has a lot more to do with the characters that you care about,for some reason the plot is n't as exciting as this one but it gets more interesting than
1,everyone involved in this movie should never be allowed,everyone in the movie is just plain boring
1,the only reason i did not waste time,the plot was very basic and predictable
1,at the end he was a bit disturbed,at least i could n't stand it any day
1,some say that she 's not very good but it is also a good thing,some of this is the biggest waste i think i can write to say that i'm
1,other people do that in the same breath i think,other than one word the dialogue was n't that bad either
1,if you like horror flicks or you can handle this movie,if not for the amount of the scenes and of the few
1,other times i thought this movie was excellent,other than that the movie also is pretty bad
1,another good example of this is his wife,another thing that was being annoying is how the
1,in fact it 's more of the same sort of film a great,in fact the acting in this movie is a little too cheesy
1,the actors who play paige 's character are great in this movie,the story is set in a time where the us navy seals up
1,helen mirren plays a very strong and very intelligent woman who is very likable,helen mirren is also a fine actress she does fine work as the main character
1,sometimes this show has more heart,sometimes all that matters are about to
1,in a small town in the city she meets a girl named lena who has been married to a wealthy lady,in the first episode it was so boring and the plot that i thought i 'd get the point to actually see
1,that 's how it was done and it is the same thing with the same exact same basic story,that was not only a big part but the whole thing was just a big pile of garbage that is
1,this is n't a horror movie,this movie has a very small budget
1,elizabeth shue 's performance is one of my favorite parts,elizabeth shue does an amazing job playing her mother very convincingly
1,the whole world has been changed with nothing and the result is one that i ca only comment as a bit out,the actors who played the main character in the movie are just so horrible and you have nothing to root at
1,why would someone make this a movie and why bother with the movie makers,why do you want a film that you do so often the most famous
1,it 's hard for you a movie to fall in a different situation but the movie does not make sense and the movie makes no sense at the end,it does however come from a good family drama and has a lot of problems but it 's not too far from a good tv movie and is not funny
1,if the director of the film had been there to choose what he could do it would 've,if you love watching a film you have to be a film student to appreciate the humor
1,however that 's probably the only question of this,however the best scene is when the killer eats her
1,i ca ca all about it and this is a great film,i ca all about this movie and i do recommend a very enjoyable
1,throw in that you can watch a whole lot better than the first,throw in a few twists but overall you have a bunch in the form
1,lori is a woman who does n't really seem interested and the story continues,lori 's sister is the daughter of a family which makes her a little rich
1,i just finished looking for a copy of the film and had no idea who,i am so amazed by a good amount and good reviews from the original
1,in a nutshell the acting is good but there is n't much of an improvement for,in my mind this is an excellent movie that is worth a watch or two
1,who 's responsible with this project and,who can find this movie boring
1,alec guinness as a young man who finds,alec baldwin is good as the sheriff
1,sorry you 're in trouble that 's why i think,sorry i do n't know where i can go
1,i had high iq and was amazed to hear that he 'd be playing a part of this film for more than,i am an aspiring viewer in paris who in turn is now my favourite of the three and in every way
1,i was able to endure that movie because of the lack,i am a big fan of the series on tv
1,in one of my favorite movies i have seen the new movies,in this film 's favor we have a bunch of actors who are
1,and why is there so many good movies dealing and not that they are funny but this film,and i have a few friends with them and they are a little more depressed about that and the
1,each character is different from them,each time the movie takes its place
1,like this movie it was more entertaining than this,like the previous movie the story line seems to be
1,but this is so bad it hurts me,but the movie is n't the worst of the
1,a real treat from everyone involved,a couple of times when i first
1,im sorry but i would n't have thought that they had to use that,im not sure why it has been so popular since the release of the first
1,anyone that thinks the movie is a genius of filmmaking should n't miss it,anyone that is so entranced by this film will be a little too easy to
1,anyway i think that they did n't have enough money to make it,anyway if only for the music alone it was n't too good in any
1,material is an original film and it is still a great experience in the history of cinema,material is very well done and you will definitely feel the need to make the movie relevant
1,so if you have n't seen the film i would highly suggest it,so he meets them but not the ones he has chosen to be as
1,there was no mention of this film,there was no attempt to make any of
1,there are some pretty funny sequences but there are several other parts in the film that are so much better than you would expect and a few laughs are funny,there is a bit of the film in the form of the film being a comedy as it deals with the subject of the conflict of life and the difficulty of
1,why does n't she run over the,why not have the original version
1,it was n't even so much the same plot as this,it was a shame to have such an intelligent look good movie
1,could have been a very cool film if it had been a bit more tolerable,could they have been a decent director to be able to get into the action industry
1,the acting is bad from the rest of us who are just,the music in the background music adds to the overall atmosphere
1,the acting by all the actresses was wonderful,the story is so thin and predictable with its
1,the acting was poor by all concerned and it was n't that great,the only thing it does is is the fact that all is n't a
1,i think this is a film that i highly recommend,i was surprised that it was released so much of a
1,i do not understand the director 's comments to describe that,i was surprised it made an excellent movie of course
1,it 's an amazing show with great performances,it is all in place and it 's easy
1,the story and the settings in the film is absolutely great,the only drawback i have with this is what is the matter
1,this is one movie that should have never been forgotten,this was not a funny thing at all it was just
1,i 've never had a better movie to watch and i 've ever seen a more realistic movie,i would say that there are a few funny gags but the plot is so weak that they could
1,the movie is pretty good but it is n't,the acting is so horrible it 's embarrassing
1,i 've never ever seen a worse movie so bad,i had n't heard of this on a whim of it
1,and why should n't they just say something about this story in the movie,and the final shot in which they look as if it was cut out and
1,in one scene the boy is sitting in a chair and,in all life the movie does n't have an ounce
1,since i think the main theme song is quite interesting to me it,since this movie was n't meant that he was n't in it
1,it 's one that has never really been mentioned and that is exactly a whole new thing,it 's the kind of film that is so long and boring that there is no sense of
1,and i 've never seen a movie infuriated with such a terrible plot,and i ca n't help but feel that this movie is not really a
1,since i have seen this film i have seen a handful of tv shows and have a,since there was one scene where one of them are killed and murdered with a chainsaw
1,no wonder the story is so bad it has no point in the first place,no one really has any of these lines which is the worst thing of his films
1,now i have nothing against this movie but i can,now you do n't have to be so young
1,if you 're a scifi buff and have a good laugh about it you should see this but you,if you 're looking for a movie that should make a profit to your intelligence and mind you
1,a group and two are invited out to the planet,a couple of young people who were murdered and tortured in
1,but the whole film is a very good,but the plot is n't even halfway
1,roman polanski does a wonderful job as director and writer robert montgomery as,roman catholic killers' has some of the best actors of the time
1,this movie is so bad i actually registered,this is a movie that will please everyone who
1,the movie is also very good and is not the best film of all time,the characters are all very different from the other films i 've ever watched
1,robert duvall is an actor in a very rare and important role as a former cop who gets into,robert mitchum is a good actor but i really do n't want any comparison here with this film
1,karen is also the only one that seems to be the real killer but she does n't get enough into the whole story she seems,karen and the stranger is n't that great or fun to look about if they are acting or the script is n't that bad
1,a very good film for me,a woman is n't the same person
1,the first one and the best that the original,the story is simple it 's just too stupid and
1,after the first few episodes i was n't convinced by a single second it could be a very slow episode,after all is said is that some guy is trying his best to make a movie he plays it straight and
1,it 's a shame that this has the best movie out all the way,it 's like a big joke that they have no idea of how the movie
1,like most modern movies and the best thing to say about this movie i have no idea how they managed to screw this film together,like the character i love his movies and the acting is so bad that one of his worst is the bad actor of the bunch
1,and the acting by the young ryan was so bad i,and it was a bit of a shock to me
1,the plot of the movie involves three friends who decide a couple that are being haunted with a mysterious virus that has been hijacked for the sole culprit of a family,the acting is n't bad the plot is n't bad and not really bad or even the script just makes the movie work and is n't funny enough to make you watch
1,only a few scenes were done well for it,only in a matter is this one to the very
1,alert i have to agree with the other reviewer but for,alert by the movie 's end it was pretty good
1,i would rather be watching them again and in my mind,i did n't know how to describe this movie and it did
1,i really liked it for the first two thirds of this movie,i am sorry that i have been watching the entire movie with my
1,he 's never been an actor and so is his wife,he is an excellent filmmaker and i hope he does n't take
1,the acting is horrible all round,the music was very very well chosen
1,look like a film about a killer,look at this movie at all
1,twins in the woods are good as the,twins have been in a bad movie
1,five years later they find the old man that the father is invited by his son,five years later i had been forced by the bbc for a month to go on and
1,young girl in her high class who plays the wife is also the first person that she meets,young girl 's daughter and his mother have all come to life the youngest daughter and his son who
1,not to mention the incredible cast members who have been on board of work for over,not only is she the only actress and she does n't have much of anything
1,hey it was not as good as i thought the movie,hey it is all a bunch you have to say
1,from the first opening sequence we see what he wants his way back,from what i saw the main characters in the film were really interesting the
1,ms is a very good film with an allstar cast,ms allen was one that would have been a hit in
1,saif ali khan is superb as well as in the role as a tough guy that,saif is a young boy with the right attitude to the heart of a woman
1,the script which i believe is a classic is just as good as the original and it is so far from the novel that it makes the viewer laugh aloud,the director has n't even made one of them so far as he should have a career to make it look like it was made by a group of students
1,you have the recipe for the movie but the first is that we never really know how it,you know it 's been a movie sometime then and it is the best in my opinion
1,fled from a prison cell of the town and the two,fled from the bank this film is a real stinker
1,so i guess i would watch the first 15 or twenty years,so in a way they should have been in it a lot more
1,izo is a film about a man who is a young woman on a journey to a place where his parents can be in his home but that,izo is still a beautiful film about a man who finds himself attracted in his arms in a small town and then becomes a little too passive
1,i saw this movie several times and it was,i do have some problems with this film
1,remade in 1995 it 's a very nice family film and a real treat,remade by the bbc 's company and you see this movie as the first feature
1,this movie is a waste story from,this movie is a must see
1,if he does n't want the audience it 's really pretty much all too bad in the end,if you watch this movie you would love you to think of yourself if your mother is n't so
1,the director has done an excellent and heartfelt job in this film,the director is trying to be hip and funny as the main character
1,it is also a very interesting movie,it 's really a shame as they 're
1,it seems that the screenwriter and his,it 's a movie in parts
1,for my tastes the best performance was for the part of the two of them,for a movie made with no real flair it is simply an excellent experience
1,they are supposed to be the perfect family and friends but the parents are all good,they 're on a journey through the streets of new mexico city which are the only ones
1,yes it 's supposed to get a bit of an oscar but it is n't,yes it sounds like he does n't look like an actor that he used in his
1,and i can tell you that if it makes you,and the movie is also in a different form
1,colonel of the company has a very large role and is actually in the film too,colonel was a real person and i was very impressed by the film the way it was
1,which is the only way to watch this movie that would make it,which does n't mean he 's going to do some other stuff
1,the acting is a little overdone,the film is a real treat for
1,i am sorry i wasted watching it for the longest 30 seconds of the movie and i really do n't even remember anything like it,i had a problem that the movie did not even seem like a real horror piece of action but it had to take a little bit
1,the story line of this movie follows a very interesting subject but,the whole thing is so bad i ca n't stand it
1,but there seems to be little of anything resembling,but even after that it 's all downhill
1,day on the left and a group are made to meet up with each others in the movie,day of fate was a perfect family entertainment that is not only forgotten but it is a good enough
1,your life is n't a huge problem because,your average for this is spinal tap
1,as the film opens with the final denouement it 's a mystery,as far as i can go this movie is one big package
1,while it could be the case of the story of the first one it 's more a parody,while some may claim it would be a bit of a surprise if the viewer is supposed that we
1,the only person who gets out on them is the one that he wants and tries his luck for the rest of his movie in an attempt to capitalize upon his knowledge about the existence,the film is quite a meditation for the viewer to get through but it 's the sort of thing that makes no sense in a film as it just seems like it 's just an excuse
1,this film is so bad it 's laughable it was awful,this movie has to be the worst i 've seen in the
1,so what do you do when a movie is made,so if you 're looking for a good time period look
1,most people who think of this series are stupid,most movies have been very bad but still very entertaining
1,avoid this movie at any time even if you 're a fan like me,avoid this at all costs as the best thing has to say was the ending
1,it is very similar in the roan and the way the film is in the end,it 's like that in a bad way but is n't it is the fact that it
1,denzel 's performance in this film is a hoot as is his character who is supposed to look a,denzel has been accused at his own life as well but he is still in the film industry
1,it is a story of how we have to deal with an unhappy life,it also has many funny scenes though and i think some people will be looking
1,i have not seen that movie but it has the same type as the original,i was so impressed that i did a complete makeover to give the film a chance
1,i just saw this movie and thought i would check it out,i would n't recommend this film to those who like the first one
1,the cast and script are all pretty good and this film is the best of the bunch and a definite must see for everyone,the story is about a group of young adults and their lives who have inherited the missing life and are living in the past
1,the movie is a mishmash and i do n't really know who would say,the whole thing is about two women having an argument and one relationship
1,murphy 's wife in the end is so bad,murphy gives a terrific performance as the leader
1,dracula and her mate 's are n't enough for them and their actions just fall into the heart,dracula is a bit of a hero but his life is so real that you actually wonder how anyone
1,the movie starts with a guy being murdered in an isolated hotel,the film is just the opposite of being a straight girl
1,that 's why i would watch it,that said the film is so bad that
1,so many of the comments seem to be on it 's own terms,so why did hollywood insist on making this movie so awful in its native
1,she did n't seem to have to make her own career but it was very very bad that you have to wait for,she is a little bit more to a little too long but she was the one who went the way i did
1,with the help being the only one the one that,with his next film he must be a writer
1,yakima canutt 's performance is great as he should be but his character,yakima canutt 's performance as the mother makes his mother a sympathetic and very
1,the plot is so thin that i wanted to turn,the movie is a total disgrace to all involved
1,the film itself was shot in black and blue to,the actors are not convincing actors in this film
1,overall this movie was so bad that one must wonder if a director should be subjected to something so bad a movie,overall this may not be a movie i 'd recommend seeing this movie as there are some nice twists and the great special
1,even the soundtrack seems to be used,even as a movie i was just hoping
1,it 's not even a movie as a whole i did think it was just a little bit of a stretch,it 's not as if the filmmakers thought that with the right material a few people would go into the film because
1,it is a wonderful portrayal of life and death,it 's a shame that this film got more exposure
1,if your not that bad this should be a must see for any movie fans,if anything the characters seem to have a real personality as they are in the movie
1,terence kerr does the best in this film,terence howard gives a very fine and engaging turn
1,on the whole while the film is a good little documentary the movie is just plain bad for the whole movie and at first there is no sense to the movie,on the way the girl decides she wants to marry a little girl but instead the boy goes to the police and she goes with the woman to go with his friend
1,i was not impressed by the film,i am a lifelong critic but i ca
1,the acting is bad at worst,the story of a woman who works
1,interviews with the cast are the story itself not the way we would expect but that is exactly,interviews with the actors they do n't seem to have a problem with this kind of picture
1,it would be hard that she could,it 's a pretty bad movie
1,from the start the story is told with the same theme,from the opening sequence the camera work takes the form
1,despite the many plot inconsistencies the movie is pretty good,despite the fact there 's no way to find this movie
1,you 'd never find anything in that movie that is supposed to have so,you will have to wait for it to get a little more fun
1,it is the type of film that makes you feel like watching the,it was so bad they made a joke like the real ghostbusters
1,in addition this is a film of a good quality,in the end we are left to ponder that he was
1,i have to tell you that this is a poor movie and i did n't really think anything like,i have to admit that if you are a real horror fan you will not appreciate this movie
1,do you think that he is a good actor and a good,do not bother with the film unless you 're not alone
1,classe keitel 's direction was a bit of a stretch and his performance is,classe tous risques also suffers a tremendous depression from this point of view
1,but as for the story it 's,but it 's not like that
1,he is an extremely good actor,he was also one of the most
1,the film is very similar to a film where the action is often revealed to us,the film looks good with a lot of blood and guts and there is no sense to
1,if your an action fan like myself you 'll see this,if that is your thing i 'd be very disappointed
1,not so much because it was n't really as funny,not that anyone involved in the making of it deserves a
1,is the film 's only flaw,is it any wonder that the writer
1,as a final summary i must say that it is a very enjoyable film,as the movie continues to get a bit ridiculous the viewer is left wondering what
1,there is so much i do find this movie to be entertaining,there was some good stuff but i never felt like watching it
1,a very bad effort to capitalize a movie,a few years ago i had a great time
1,unfortunately the story begins as they are being pursued by several random villains,unfortunately i am not the only one at this age of that
1,i would give it 10 out of 5,i would give this movie a 7
1,the film begins in a very satisfying way,the plot of a woman with the past of
1,if you are n't going and find a real horror movie you will probably like it for being the least bit,if you have never seen the original series or are in a mood and having to rely on your own life you
1,there 's also an element that was interesting as we are talking to,there were a lot more laughs and the characters are more appealing
1,he also meets another young person whose life is threatened by some sort,he makes it to the end of the film that is so sad to
1,people who were very disappointed in their lives and the fact he 's not a good looking guy in the film,people who know are n't even better at fangoria cinema should not see the movie and the whole movie is n't even
1,the acting is not as bad at all but as i write it i ca n't,the movie was made at mgm 's best but was n't a very special mention
1,the script also allows a group of people who seem to have some good ideas,the first part of the tale is that of a young man searching as the hero
1,the ending of the film is the worst i can hope ever but the rest of it just sucks out,the film 's title of the film is as the movie is told from the outset of which of course is
1,if you are a fan of a great book or if the book was n't going,if you 're in your teens for good entertainment check me out and rent it
1,the movie begins slowly but it really is,the movie also has a bit about the power
1,this is a movie for kids who ca like their parents or adults,this is the only movie i can think of that makes me cry i
1,do n't get it just put it a bad movie and do n't waste time to waste your rental and time on,do n't get my costs and get a copy of a movie to find out that it should be a remake
1,like some of the others i have seen this film is very good too,like the film is more of a mystery than a thriller of the sort
1,of the many other films this is one of my favourite films i have,of all his films he is a master of the art of filmmaking
1,all this was done to us by the fact it,all the characters of the movie were all good
1,i think a lot and the director had to go out and write a movie,i am a big fan of the show and it scared the heck out of anyone
1,scenes have been in place for awhile and i do n't think that,scenes and dialog are so lame that you 'll just laugh hysterically
1,it 's all over the place so as it is i just could n't care what happens,it could n't be more accurate because there was not enough material to make the film
1,this guy is the one who thinks a movie,this movie is just plain bad with nothing
1,aimed at the fact that you are a kid or you,aimed at a couple minutes of screen work on display
1,but when you 've got to see it in the middle of it it can only get the occasional attention,but he has n't done his work for so long and so i cannot even say that he is really bad
1,and the movie has a very interesting ending,and there were lots better movies to be seen
1,nikita was a very good film i think it was one for a rainy afternoon in the summer of 1947 in,nikita has some interesting moments in the book but overall there was not much to recommend it to any other
1,the characters are a group of people the size of their own family and they all know that the best way they can come from this film is,the plot is not bad the actors are wooden and you ca n't blame them to watch the movie and you 've got to get sucked in
1,this movie is an embarrassment for me,this is not a great film if you
1,do not buy a dime or a copy of it,do yourselves for all those who love this film
1,the movie is n't bad in fact it is actually quite good,the movie is based on a play which i 've seen most times
1,back to back he meets his old family friends and kids,back in my opinion this is what we call a movie
1,no one has ever heard of this film as a whole,no matter how many times he 's got the balls to be
1,i have always had an open mind with the film for the first hour,i had never seen the original version which had a lot less action or plot
1,i have the feeling that i am not watching the movie because,i was very surprised when i saw the film for it
1,the story of the boy is really great the character development really was very different i,the plot is not really interesting enough but the acting and dialogue is really awful
1,yes it 's not that bad either,yes the story is a bit thin in
1,i saw this film at a sneak preview in the usa and it was a great film i would have,i would love to know more about him that the movie would have been better to get it better
1,other scenes where the actors are actually quite convincing with a good plot,other reviewers say that in a good part of the series the characters are
1,one of the worst films i have watched,one of the worst films i 've seen and
1,the story starts at a time in which people are getting,the only good thing about this film was the ending
1,fine cast but also a few funny lines,fine in an understated way the film is n't
1,anyway it 's an important point to get the message boards for this turkey in my opinion,anyway it 's hard to imagine that if someone in the cast could n't really pull on the
1,the acting is great but there is no real reason to be there,the main problem in most films from all aspects was to try
1,we 're also treated to some very bad performances,we know he has the power but he gets to
1,anybody who has ever seen the film know exactly why this movie would receive an 8 in the book,anybody can possibly find a good looking copy on the disc dvd extras of the film and have a long
1,light is a wonderful example of how the film ends,light hearted and a fine example in a film that has
1,the first half of the movie is not as bad but that really is n't what 's really happening,the acting was good enough and i was expecting something from the actors from the movie to the big names
1,while it does have an overall decent rating to me it is so hard to accept,while there is a couple of funny moments in this film it 's really a good movie
1,as a film director visconti 's directorial debut is not very well suited to the screen he should be the director of the film,as far from as if a film is meant by a director or writer in which the director is the director andor the writer or
1,i just finished thinking the way the characters interact and the plot was a bunch,i was also impressed with the fact that the film was a bit more than it
1,this is one film that will probably stay with me,this movie had me interested and i had to have a
1,i saw it when they were released in 1987 and i still have a fondness to it and i,i am a big fan and so when i read it i thought it was pretty darn good
1,the only thing that really makes this film is that it has to offer it 's characters and the,the story is very strong and it is a story of love and loyalty between the two men
1,but i guess that the movie was a big disappointment but i found the first to,but i have to admit that this is the worst film i have yet seen
1,the only good thing to see was that the plot was not funny but the execution was really poor,the first half of the movie is pretty much as good a movie and better to watch the film is
1,every once in awhile we get to know the audience about their childhood,every scene in this movie is just as funny as a brick 's mouth
1,this is a good movie that 's worth seeing,this story is a real treat to watch on an
1,but this film has the perfect combination of music to make the,but it 's all a great movie for the whole family
1,days later i was so scared that i wasted 2 hrs of my time watching it,days of the living dead' are being filmed and they 're not only on the top of
1,of all the remakes i saw it was a complete waste and i 've heard all the bad movies and i can,of which to begin to do not have to make this show at my favorite the lists is definitely more enjoyable
1,the only reason this movie is so wonderful,the characters do n't work at all
1,i have always wondered when this film will ever be available on video but i ca n't imagine anyone else doing,i had to give this film a 3 because the acting was a little weak especially from an early actress
1,being in the military i ca n't really be able to suspend disbelief as to what is really happening,being a fan of horror cinema and having seen it for a couple minutes i still remember it from the
1,this was the first time that i had searched to the end,this is probably the worst movie to come out of the year
1,if you 're one to think about a series that could n't get out of line,if there 's a chance of getting a dvd release it 's a good thing
1,what is the matter with a movie,what 's so sad about the story
1,not the best movie by any means but not a great one,not only is it just about the action scenes it also features more
1,and it 's pretty much an homage to the big lebowski,and then the camera pans off to the side when he is
1,i have seen some really good film but this one really shines,i 've heard that you 'll be seeing a bad movie in the
1,as for the acting i have to say that i have,as i mentioned earlier it is a pretty good movie
1,izo is a very poor attempt at humor that is often too obvious,izo is a wonderful film for young children who know what to tell
1,it 's so bad it 's laughable,it is as though the director had made
1,ms allen plays a woman who is in,ms russell is one such an actress
1,they are also in love the two couples are,they are the kind we 've known about
1,the whole concept is a bunch and the action is pretty good,the acting was not good and there were no actors who seemed so
1,her friend has the ability to do anything but fulfill her and is also not happy to see what she is trying for the other to be,her role in the film was very poor and the ending was a disappointment at times but i was n't sure i 'd seen it before
1,i think this was one 's favorite movie,i love all three of the stooges but they
1,without much of an action plot line the action sequences are pretty cheap and dull,without much of a plot the action sequences were not so convincing and the ending was
1,as in many of the films i know she was in,as a result it just feels rather flat and dull
1,the film is about the journey of some old friends and one of a few of the best characters involved in a very difficult movie for the,the film was shot in the same location as it 's a very long shot of the same scene which is not only blurry or handheld
1,especially in the last scene and the scene where she is walking out,especially in those moments you can hear the song and the music
1,if i were in the theater i 'd be the only one to find it 's existence,if i was n't for all the wrong reasons i would have gotten this one out a couple
1,one thing is in the beginning he 's given a little and the camera pans down at the other side and the actors seem to be the one by the,one thing that made this one of the worst films i have come up over is the fact the director did not have anything to do with the script
1,he does so with the help from this movie,he is just an awful actor and that 's because
1,salsa is a typical character in a sitcom and shows no signs that i thought the story,salsa is a very bad character that does not appear even in the least of that
1,and when he 's not the good he was,and the whole thing is like a bunch
1,with her in her life she finds happiness in a world that will never have existed in a big,with these two leads each episode was really the most engaging and funny show i had ever seen
1,everything in this film is a total disgrace and it 's impossible for us,everything is so bad that i do n't want to ruin the movie
1,the film is about a young boy trying out her revenge of her life,the plot was so thin and uninteresting that i felt that there was a twist
1,this film does n't need to be a problem in a genre,this is a film for everyone who enjoys it as much as the
1,even if you 're a mormon and the other who was a great fan like in the original you 'll like this,even when i had seen more of a movie than i was expecting to see that one of the more interesting characters was
1,match in the dark is a fun comedy,match of this movie to a degree is the
1,if you have a chance at this movie you do n't have it on your resume,if it were like the first scene i 'd have to say this is one of my
1,these are not even the ones that are the good,these kids who think the film should be released
1,other people i mentioned here seem surprised by it being the most accurate description to me to be a fan,other than that i have to say that this movie is a bad copy that the director is n't trying to
1,has n't the movie seen a movie,has it ever been a movie
1,i 've always been a huge fan of hers,i was really looking forward to watching this movie
1,if you 're not too young to watch it you will have to sit through the movie,if one can get to see one of her other movies please watch it with you
1,however the film still works out as an interesting film,however i ca all about this show on tv
1,the only redeeming factor is the music,the only good thing about this film was
1,this movie will not make you feel like i 've been in a good film for the past 15 or five times but,this movie is like a movie designed to be something of an art film and that the main characters are very funny
1,following the story of a man with a family 's heart it is very easy and it 's obvious that all the people,following the story of an ordinary boy who is born to his mother he becomes a young boy for the most part
1,second the music was the most fun to watch in this type,second of all there a bunch that is so funny i could n't
1,ms ricci looks lovely she has a nice screen time with a beautiful smile and a strong personality that she ca all of her friends but also to the point that i feel compelled to be,ms page 's performance is quite nice the actress 's performance is brilliant and while the acting has her own good acting in the beginning of that film she does quite good in the role
1,i would not waste the time to watch this movie,i think the director should have taken the character and cast
1,woody laurel was an excellent actor but this movie is not even bad enough it is a mess,woody 's character is a bit more complex in the role of the character rather than a comic book
1,the film is also about the man who dies and is now an outsider in the past,the plot of the movie is just as bad as the first film and the ending is so
1,the film was shot in a studio that resembles a group called a giant robot,the acting and story of these characters are not too far too short i could not
1,though the idea of having a child fight in the past the movie,though the film had great acting all the actors were really good
1,through most of the first scenes of the series the film is set,through this movie i got hooked by watching this film a bit
1,there is also a very dark story of a couple in the early 1900 's,there have always be a big number of movies that i like i 've never been
1,i'm sure everyone 's been interested in the story but the movie is a little weak,i'm giving this movie a 10 out 10 10 stars is 1 the best of the 4
1,the story involves an american businessman who has a nervous breakdown with men who were sent to a,the plot is so simple that i do n't care how i could react to the plot
1,she was in the movie at least she,she has her best in the role
1,the characters were so bland that there 's almost no,the music is just wonderful and adds much depth
1,the plot is weak and the characters act like they are a cardboard cutout of a stereotypical idiot,the acting was ok but i really enjoyed the story and the way the story was delivered
1,stone also has a great role as the,stone the first movie was a classic
1,the film is about an english boy being played with a heart by the,the ending is n't the only good thing i 've seen since then
1,if anyone has any info on the movie you should have to make fun of the whole thing,if there ever was a reason to watch this film would be that i am just sitting around saying
1,all in all this is a great,all the characters are really good
1,the only character to have played the film has a little personality that has to be the strangest of the bunch to win in the end,the movie is about a young boy named sosuke who wants an experimental baby but does nothing to get the girl he wants and his love for
1,the film is so dull that there 's nothing else in it,the story involves a guy who is hired into the world and falls
1,but he 's a very bad guy who,but he is one hell of star
1,a few of the songs are funny but the music is so loud in general,a little more like the typical suspects that have no idea that a new generation would
1,however i am convinced in a story which i have n't seen in years that i can really,however in the end it 's a nice film that has a nice touch at the end
1,but it 's not the worst horror film i 've ever seen and it 's not even,but i can forgive the poor acting of this movie as the worst movie ever made
1,or did i mention one or the other was a great,or why was n't the smartest of the four episodes
1,this movie is so awful it hurts me to,this movie has everything a horror movie needs
1,this is a movie that i would advise you,this is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen
1,the music of johnny and the music is so good and it,the movie is not about the life that is the world
1,whilst it is n't all that great it 's still a good show,whilst the movie may actually be a bit dated this was also an attempt
1,a great deal for an average movie,a very sad and very very very funny
1,but it was made to be a classic movie about the evils and consequences of life in life with the,but the director is trying so it was hard for the audience to take his own place for good
1,someone was trying to explain the movie so that all the idiots,someone said something like this a little bit like the original
1,it 's not an action movie it 's just a bunch of clichs,it is so much better than that i had seen it before
1,in fact it 's very difficult to take anything away from this movie so i ca only recommend this one,in the end he 's a very strong and loyal man who has no choice no more to say
1,john cena did a superb performance in this movie,john carradine is good as a bad guy whose character
1,but this was all about his own creation,but i do n't know who would be really
1,i 've been a fan of his movies for over 20 years,i did n't know who this was supposed or to be but what
1,both are all pretty much as big as they do,both men are attracted to the task of being a member
1,we are so excited that she has a long career in the middle of the road so she decides to go with her,we 're shown that these characters are really not as important as the two other movies but it 's just not enough to withstand
1,the acting was very good although as well it was pretty bad,the director is the producer and actors the movie makers are so good
1,its also pretty good to watch all its flaws and its very enjoyable and good enough,its also a big problem is that it is n't even mentioned as a film for a
1,the film follows a group that is n't really trying and the characters are not as developed as some have mentioned before is,the movie is also the most important portrayal of an artist i have heard of and a little over the top i thought it
1,the first movie was the second installment to the first installment but it 's not,the only problem is that there 's the usual dumb stuff of a movie
1,it 's also an interesting tale of a girl who has to face in order to,it was all done with a budget that the production crew had to put through
1,the plot was interesting the script is a little bit of a twist in the final third episode but the ending is somewhat disappointing,the only redeeming quality of this is that there is a small supporting cast that includes peter baldwin donald pleasence michael clarke michael imperioli john
1,i have no clue why this movie has a lot more to say,i thought i was seeing an old film about the hardships of the lives
1,then you know how to make the first movie but it is still a little slow to watch and the film is not that great,then again i 'll be the first movie to be made that way so as i have n't said i do n't want to waste 90
1,plagued with a strong story that was n't the original it seems as though it was made up to be a bit too long but it really did n't work and did n't work,plagued with the same plot as the first two films i was surprised that this one is n't for everyone but i will give credit to the performance of the young woman who had nothing
1,i had been looking forward into seeing this movie in the,i had to watch it again and i loved it
1,indeed i 'd say you 'll have,indeed the movie is a mess
1,the ending is very disappointing and not that good but you have got an idea,the only redeeming thing in my book is that it is a real movie and not
1,plus the story which is the only part of the movie that really makes you laugh,plus a few scenes which seem to be the only clue to me to watch the final
1,the acting was good in every way,the acting is not really that bad i
1,great acting great production values costumes and costumes,great performances from the leads involved with one another
1,beginning with a great cast including michael j moore and,beginning with the final confrontation is just so bizarre
1,it is also a great performance from john ford playing a detective,it was so bad that they were all i thought were the best
1,another reviewer called this a good film and the acting is ok but i would rate it a 1 but it should not be seen,another aspect the film was made was an interesting character study of how to act and how the world was depicted in the us
1,either my own or the movie just made me want,either way i 'll give this show a chance
1,read in the back of the box if someone asked them what,read the book and you will know exactly what to feel
1,the whole thing seemed more contrived than the movie made,the story is based around the play of the same year
1,sure this was one of the first movies i 've seen i,sure the show is a bit dated and will not appeal
1,this film is quite possibly my alltime top ten favorite film,this is a great movie that is definitely worth seeing
1,bad acting terrible script poor special affects bad acting and the,bad acting and bad acting bad script and lame plot
1,this is one bad movie from beginning,this is an extremely good movie
1,apparently the movie had a lot more,apparently the film is very dated
1,anyway i 'd like to see a good,anyway the movie is a little slow
1,faith is a classic movie of a woman who is a struggling housewife,faith domergue does a nice thing in this movie but not a bad movie
1,and that makes it very enjoyable,and the ending is so funny that
1,this movie has a few funny bits of humor just like the bad movies like anchorman,this film is so poor that i had to watch it for the first time and i
1,the only reason why i rated this movie 1 out of 10 was because it had nothing to offer,the movie was filmed in the seventies and it is a bit long for the eyes that it had
1,for the first time i was thinking he 's a bad guy in the movie but we have n't seen him,for those who know that the whole thing is so funny and a lot of the characters in that movie
1,but it 's a movie that i would definitely want to watch with a better eye for it,but the film still has some good points it does n't go beyond that the whole thing is an
1,folks he did not get that kind of treatment,folks that are not really as good either
1,then it is the kind of film that we should be tempted to endure in some ways,then in a scene of a man sitting on a bench and having a conversation with someone he
1,i was surprised to see the cast of all that i 've got,i ca least see why the director would n't have thought it was a
1,where do you get to the movies,where is the film that 's so bad
1,the movie does have the right blend of humor in that it does n't have an actual story it is a,the only reason i gave it 2 out was it was so low budget could have been done so bad
1,there is a sense for the character who is the real hero,there is no doubt that the director has a great imagination with this
1,he is n't a good actor though he seems to be in fine supporting roles,he then proceeds up to him for what he can do as a boy of his
1,snider is a young actor who has not been a great,snider is a talented guy for the role of god
1,after that we get a lot more fun and more fun than the first,after watching the film i am a young man who 's been subjected in an
1,watching a movie that i was amazed about i had read a lot about it,watching it with the lights open off and being a fan of it does n't really
1,it was n't until i watched the film for about ten minutes,it 's also a very funny one at the box office
1,when we see the movie we learn that the father is trying to make the trip on the phone but is n't,when i saw the preview of this movie my roommate and we both agreed i was in for a good time
1,two years after i finally saw a preview movie i,two things are the best acting in this movie
1,garage whitaker makes his best appearance in the world and he 's always great at playing the,garage of the fireflies was another great film with a stellar cast and an overall story
1,what i really hate about it was,what 's this film about that
1,if only they had to put it the film would not be released if i was on the brink of it,if you have not read the book i do n't understand why some other reviewers here have said this is an adaptation
1,the story is about some guy who falls for a young man to take on a werewolf who lives in the dark future,the whole idea to get a little more interesting than this crap does n't mean that it 's an adult flick like that and
1,they were the ones that were responsible for her in the first half,they did not show this to a film as the movie is
1,another aspect of the film that i did n't like was the scene that was shown in the,another scene i did n't even notice was when the guy playing it in a black bar
1,and when her dad and the guy he was dead in and of the fact he was n't killed,and for what it is an amazing movie it was not as good to me as it was
1,she just seemed like a young girl,she 's the only person on board
1,another character named jesse is a very unlikable woman who loves and loves the family and loves them,another movie is the fact is this is a comedy and a movie that is not funny
1,besides it 's a movie i have never watched,besides this being a very good movie i still think
1,this is a film i would rate,this is a movie worth watching
1,lucy silverstone plays jane eyre a woman with a soft spot at the hands of a young woman who seems the other actress,lucy silverstone plays the mother who 's trying to help her solve the mystery of this mysterious woman in the family and in the
1,no one could have pulled a better judgment to his work and he certainly does have a lot in his,no one will really think that the movie has the makings that a bad film but a good one
1,several people were left at the party to be,several of the jokes do n't make sense
1,proving it could be a decent film with the cast of some of the most interesting characters to grace the entire world for,proving by my friends to watch it i have the same reaction as the old man in white and his black cape
1,all the women of wongo should have stayed,all these scenes are filmed in a completely different
1,you see the main characters and their characters and the plot twists are not just bad things,you know who the real good guy is but it 's the movie 's main flaw
1,at that point there 's an unexpected twist on the film as the film moves on to,at the very least i think the people who wrote this movie knew about the film
1,this is the funniest movie you 'll ever seen but then again i do find a lot,this is my opinion i am not a great fan but this is not for me
1,this is a very bad movie,this is one that you can enjoy
1,sure there are some interesting moments but not enough,sure the story is not as good but not too
1,just a lot more like the real life,just saw this movie when it was on tv
1,or the fact is this is not the worst film,or in fact a movie for a good film
1,at that point the film becomes very long and the end credits were too long,at this the rest of our seats is still as we see the film
1,this would have been another interesting topic to the film that the main,this film is not for everyone it 's not a great film
1,yet this film does not have a very good story or direction,yet there is a very very interesting plot involving a character played on
1,martin sheen gives a performance as always to the film 's credit and one of them is,martin is the one with the golden family and his eyes are always on the show
1,as for the other actors there 's no character development,as the title suggests it is not as bad to begin
1,the acting and dialogue is not very good,the acting by some of the cast is atrocious
1,a man is not a man with all kinds memories,a lot of people seem to dislike this one
1,do n't get me started over my rating for this film,do yourself a favor and watch this film with it
1,when a movie is made i think you will be watching the movie in the first place,when the young victoria 's mother finally catches her son she is rescued in the process of the
1,this is a great film for lovers who want to see a good movie,this movie did not get made even a few scenes were done before
1,they were very hard to take over and put,they even do a great number of things
1,we had to sit through the whole thing,we follow his character from an experience and into
1,luckily if it does not make for tv movies i might have,luckily the movie is not only great but it is not
1,we know that this guy is the one who 's hired the police and he has a fight of,we follow an endless stream of events from an interesting point and never before being done with them
1,leland the oldest son and the son 's daughter is all that,leland 's love for her and of course she was in the film
1,the ending is so ridiculous that i can honestly say i did n't care,the film was shot and the film has been edited over the years to come
1,a little bit slow in places,a good job to the film 's
1,throughout this film all that makes this movie fun is,throughout this movie there was a lot of nudity
1,it is a movie that shows people how to act and act like the movie is,it has no relation for a few episodes but it still keeps a mystery and an aura
1,the movie starts off with the same old man and his friend talking to the dead,the director and her two children are on the road for no one at night
1,the actors are all very good although,the acting and directing are flawless
1,avoid at all costs avoid that movie as i was hoping to be disappointed,avoid at all costs unless you want to sit back watch this movie
1,or why did n't he just kill him or not,or how dare you find some funny scenes when you have
1,one could have a good idea of what the other side of,one of the better of my childhood experiences on the movie
1,paul naschy 's score is the perfect complement for,paul muni is perfect in the title character
1,i saw this film and i am amazed at all the people that say that this,i 've never seen it but i do have been so compelled to watch it
1,charles grodin is a brilliant character,charles grodin is a joy show for
1,i just do n't think this show could possibly,i thought it would be an awesome movie
1,plot line is there the director is in his prime to take the story out,plot synopsis is one of the most beautiful films and one of the finest ever
1,to add insult about the plot the characters are completely ridiculous,to be honest i do n't remember the plot line of the
1,unlike the first time i tried to think of it as i was in the theatre with the movie it seemed to be something of a stretch,unlike the other reviewer i have n't said it 's that simple but it has many great moments and a nice ending which i found the only way
1,in this film she plays a very shy woman who has a crush on him,in a sense this movie should take a very long time to be so happy that
1,you can see it coming from the same director,you will enjoy the acting and you 'll see it
1,a very good film with some funny touches that makes it difficult to relate and laugh throughout to laugh through,a lot of the actors and crew are involved here the story line is interesting in every department it is a
1,it 's just that bad acting and directing,it 's almost an inch to all of the
1,gant 's portrayal of the film is as,gant and dunne are both excellent actors
1,and of all the games that have come into existence i 've been able to,and the story is a very good one and it is so very enjoyable
1,let the other comments here here say it 's not a bad idea to show a movie that could make you laugh,let us tell you that we are supposed to be the hero 's mother and we all feel the pain the mother has
1,as a result i was n't too impressed with the film,as a longtime fan of the genre i thought it was a
1,and as for the acting and directing i think she is not a very good actress either she 's a bad actress and i really ca,and the story is about a very interesting person who is obsessed with his death and his relationship with his friend in a different film
1,if you do n't mind your kids do n't watch it,if you have to see this for the second time
1,i saw in a few years of this film,i saw it for about 5 or 20 minutes and
1,i saw this when it were released at the sundance film festival,i had a great opportunity into a film which actually was one such
1,the acting is ok and you can feel like i was watching the worst movie of a similar theme,the movie opens to the end of the picture of a bunch of women from the war who has been
1,the story revolves around a man trying at a war,the movie opens with a guy who kills her
1,the first 15 minutes of the movie are pretty lame but the whole,the acting was great and it made for a very interesting movie
1,this is a good movie about a couple people,this film is an embarrassment to both films
1,no one has ever heard of it for a long long night,no one has a sense of humor and that would n't be the
1,but it really did n't make sense at least,but this is one of my favorite movies
1,there are only three things that do not even get the job done the other direction was the most convincing aspect and the,there is only one problem i have about his films which are often so far from the most recent films to date
1,michael jackson does an amazing role as the,michael dudikoff is a genius in this
1,the only thing that saved me about this movie was the soundtrack,the first half hour or so i 've seen better films with less
1,while i think the movie is a bit too violent and too brief it does n't seem to be in a very long way and i do have,while the acting is a little too stiff and not convincing enough to carry this the movie fails miserably as a thriller and not so great either
1,this show was n't funny in that sense but it was the real show,this is one of his films in which his father gives a great portrayal into
1,i have n't seen the film yet but it will definitely be a,i thought that this movie is going to be a good idea
1,if you like horror cinema and want to have a good movie i highly doubt this,if not the filmmakers should just go back to the movie 's ideas in order
1,i would recommend this movie as a warning,i had no sympathy in the cinema
1,the director had a very low budget the,the characters are n't developed at all
1,in this respect it is the best movie of 2006,in the end we do n't get too deep as it
1,the movie was n't great nor is that,the plot is a good mix of old and
1,the film is so boring and so boring that,the characters that are introduced are likable caricatures
1,it 's as though the writer had a budget with low budget,it was an excellent show that had a lot of potential
1,that 's a shame because this sequel was a lot more fun then it 's been,that 's what the film did but in the movie it was a movie for it
1,it 's all very very bad even though we should not have been paying much to see him go through his role and making,it 's about a woman who gets murdered and murdered by his boyfriend and son on a road trip to a nearby house
1,he is given a chance to be in the army,he was a quiet genius and not a great actor at
1,it was like watching a train accident in the middle when the actors were trying hard and,it is a story that you should see in every way and the acting was excellent
1,in fact there is no need to see such movies but when they watch it again and again,in fact it is a shame for many of us who would like to see another movie
1,acting has nothing in it for him,acting is bad even for someone who has
1,rest of us are not so stupid as in this show or so,rest of the movie is the typical american werewolf movie which is actually about
1,i have n't seen any horror movie in my lifetime which is so bad i do not even come up,i was n't even sure whether there were any parts of the film that seemed really funny or interesting
1,before the movie i started to think of all the problems in making this movie to be watched,before that they can be blamed to the fact that they can act at the same time
1,luckily it has a good cast and has to be the best i 've ever read and the script is great,luckily he just does that in the last episode with the exception and some of the other members of his crew of
1,it 's not funny or funny at times except the acting,it is one of those movies that just does a bad job
1,i'm also surprised it ended up being a movie about the evils and the troubles of the time it takes to,i'm sorry but i have seen this movie so many of my friends that we can understand why it happened
1,this movie makes absolutely awful sense,this movie made it out of the
1,in fact it is so bad that it could have easily done a better job,in other words i think the best thing ever is if i could find it on
1,i was a very little skeptical at first i thought this,i have n't seen so much in a tv show
1,though the movie is based in a good book by the same title it 's quite easy,though she was n't the most talented character in this movie and i loved her character
1,if you 're looking forward to seeing it do so with the other comments,if that was n't enough the whole movie is a very dull film
1,now i 'll get the dvd,now i would n't be surprised if
1,while some say he 's not all too happy he makes the mistake of,while watching this flick will be like the first hour of your life
1,i would be more proud but i have to admit that i have never seen anything like this before,i was shocked at how the plot unfolds after the film started to become a big success but it had
1,tell me the story of something that is n't in any way,tell them you 're not going to make a good movie
1,and what was it all for this was one of,and i think that 's where the similarities come
1,also some of those actors are very good,also they have to be more stupid because he
1,it is a bit slow moving and very poorly done,it 's like watching a bunch with some leftover video
1,after watching this movie i realized how the world was not all about the film 's message on the subject,after the screening of my first introduction i saw a screener and watched it again on the sundance channel
1,it 's a pity that they do n't have enough money for the sequel because their name is still a bad one and i think they would make it better than it should have been,it 's a shame i was n't so impressed with the end of the series after i left halfway through the film and wondering where it was going to get it 's point across
1,days after i watched the tv series of the same night i thought that all of them were actually very good but the acting was very,days later we get an idea of a man who has been told about how much he loved himself to survive but he does it
1,so the movie is just plain boring not to mention the fact that it 's a ripoff,so it 's not the first and only one is a good movie to watch with a lot
1,and of note there was n't a single word,and why did that mean man did not
1,they should have gone down in the series,they do n't want to go out and buy
1,both are a good story but that 's what they are,both men are not quite up to the task and the film
1,i'm not even sure i could understand the way they tried to make,i'm glad that i have n't seen one of the other ones
1,some people might argue on that but for the first time i could 've had it,some say some of the things they were trying to accomplish but it was so funny
1,douglas mitchell is great in a role,douglas sirk 's score is the best as
1,sadly it 's too long and for a movie it 's too,sadly a bit of the humor is used here and there
1,just the idea of a real man a girl and her mother,just a few words i will give you to this review
1,this film is a perfect fit in,this was a really stupid film
1,the acting in this piece makes for some odd stunts,the film is quite a good watch especially the end of
1,john frankenheimer is in his element as,john cusack as the evil butler
1,the ending is a bit schmaltzy but the film is a real treat,the film has two separate scenes of the three protagonists in their respective respective
1,says to the first 10 minutes or so,says this movie is just a cheap cheap and
1,i'm so glad i rented it,i'm also very very confused that i
1,this show does n't even look like it 's been set in,this is the film 's only color flaw in the film
1,the plot line is so bad the script just is n't so funny,the only saving graces in the film is where the camera zooms off
1,it also shows us a true friendship between the characters and the movie which really really brings the movie back to a film that is still worth a look for,it was very disappointing to see it coming out and that the director was able for a lot of movies from this era which he did n't know of it 's
1,the main problem of it is that the only good thing of it is the fact of this is a good enough film to show in your mind,the movie is full of clichs and the acting was all quite amateurish but the story was so stupid i actually laughed and i loved the acting
1,jamie foxx is a brilliant actor here and he is perfect at playing a straight man,jamie kennedy was a young actor but he was just annoying at times and the whole movie
1,good action movie but good acting excellent action,good action and some action movie making
1,but this film had a bad screenplay,but if you do manage it with a
1,i really enjoyed this movie very much and i,i do n't think anyone would want me
1,until the final revelation it was all just as much better,until the last fifteen minutes i realized a movie was made to
1,i was so disappointed that i decided to give it another try,i do not know what a person could say about this movie
1,in his first movie he does n't really get as much attention as he does,in my opinion this movie was made by a group to watch this thing
1,very little in this film are the two leads from the first,very good film with excellent acting and a very good screenplay
1,i was very surprised by the story line and acting and the plot,i do n't know whether you are a fan or not you are in
1,for those with more screen time in this case it is a little long,for all the hype you 've read the other reviews are pretty bad
1,when you have n't heard about this show before you 've seen this movie,when all this was supposed to be it was about the way of life and
1,the movie is a comedy about a bunch of college people who have been abused and want them to be happy with the old life,the movie has a nice pace that is quite unusual but not quite as effective when there was an actual story of the characters
1,unfortunately this time this is n't a movie for everyone who has to watch,unfortunately the story line has n't been done properly enough to be funny
1,score 1 was the only drawback in this film,score a half an hour but a bit slow in
1,i was impressed by the fact that i have seen that many times,i do n't know why this movie was made but it was a bit
1,while i was n't a bit surprised that at all the acting in many movies i found the film to make me laugh and laugh,while the film is very dark in the way it depicts the lives of these two protagonists it does n't do their work justice
1,this is a very funny action flick and i think everyone will see,this is probably the biggest reason this review has been released theatrically
1,and it 's all for people who,and this is a good film
1,it is the only movie that can offer any entertainment value,it 's like it 's just a bunch to hang out from
1,there 's a few seconds of footage missing out of some really bad acting ability and even,there was n't a scene in which the two main characters were conversing in real people
1,in that regard he looks like a guy who 's been brainwashed by his wife 's past and the last of the three musketeers,in this film it is a pretty bad movie which is actually about the effects and effects of how the movie goes haywire
1,then the ending was just plain silly and it was,then the story moves along nicely and it shows
1,it 's very nice to know that they have had some ideas,it was an early great movie to get a glimpse of
1,indeed it was quite a bit of a sleeper though,indeed they did not have much to do with the film
1,at times the film is so bad that i ca only think twice if the script and production values is n't good or,at the same scene i would n't have seen it in a theater as an adult i do not like the original
1,dressler gives an excellent performance as the troubled,dressler and harris do a great job
1,even a little kid from a distance would kill,even the actors that are a great team are given
1,i had the opportunity and i watched it because i thought the cover is good and i did n't like the character or story line and found the acting as much of the film as he had been and in,i am not going to give a damn about what happened at the time the first few minutes of the movie and the ending was n't just a twist but because it left me wanting to watch it again
1,i think that the movie was really fun watching and it was one of the many times that i had,i was so disappointed in seeing this film i had a hard earned screening in the first fifteen minutes
1,creepshow 3 was a complete disappointment for me though the original sequel was a little disappointing,creepshow ii is one of those few movies that is so bad it makes sense
1,that was the best part in this entire film when one,that 's the question the whole movie is based on
1,for all the reasons i think they are supposed the best of the films of the past,for one person in the film that is what is going around and not even a person would
1,this is a wonderful film that deserves to go on for all its flaws and if you have a,this movie was made in 1978 and it 's not even funny but it is definitely worth watching
1,i was not looking forward to a movie,i do n't know why anyone would want to
1,uma thurman as the heroine is great and i think that this movie has,uma thurman as mrs was an embarrassment to the movie 's supporting character
1,and it just goes for that matter,and the music in general is the most
1,i thought she was very talented i would n't give this movie a,i 've always loved it and it 's a pretty good one
1,i'm not entirely sure how many times i have seen a film that,i'm afraid it will be remembered as the greatest movie ever made
1,but i do not believe i have,but the film is too long
1,i would like it for that one,i am surprised that this film was made
1,instead we get the characters are introduced to us to the story and not in the least,instead i got the impression that it was filmed from the first movie to the second
1,c thomas howell has a cameo as one of the most powerful villains in the whole movie to make this role,c aubrey has made a good film of the film and the fact there are many films of that era that i
1,the only thing that kept my mind of,the cast of this movie is excellent
1,indeed it does manage in this film to the end but also does n't,indeed there 's one great fight sequence and the scene is the end
1,overall the movie has great acting great script great direction excellent direction and a solid,overall i give this movie a 0 and recommend you rent it on dvd
1,even if you do see this movie you will enjoy the movie,even after that movie had ended i was left with the feeling that
1,they had a chance but a little more fun in the story than the,they have a very unique concept of a different person and the people
1,even when it came out the same the,even more than a million or fifteen
1,at the beginning and of course the man is in bed the only,at best it could n't just make them look more like idiots
1,there 's nothing really good for an action movie,there 's absolutely no mention of the real world behind
1,son and daughter have their head firmly planted,son does the best with his performance
1,this movie shows that the film has not been the best,this movie is no doubt in that it is not
1,anyway this movie was great because i think the main character is that bad and he gets to be a jerk,anyway it 's one thing the acting and script are all over for all the wrong ways to be honest
1,um it 's not a total waste but it 's the kind of movie that makes your skin stand still,um do you realize that a man like this was the only person who knew that a human being could be
1,i saw the film yesterday and i still ca by,i am ashamed that this is not a film
1,on the surface a very boring movie that should be ashamed of its rightful merits,on a deeper note it is a good movie though it is the only one with
1,a little later then it does have a few funny moments,a few years later this is another film i do n't think
1,for the majority they 're not in the best buds,for example one night in the woods the mother and her
1,you should do that and the movie is just over and you have to watch,you have seen the movie and not only do it 's thing it does
1,because of this i thought this movie,because i'm not a christian guy
1,the acting was awful and the script was awful,the movie does n't end with some scenes of the
1,this is the perfect example of a good movie,this film had been done in several years and a
1,kate beckinsale was excellent in it,kate winslet is the only way i
1,what a mess it really is,what a great movie that is
1,he is so funny to watch with a group he and it,he has n't done anything like that since his last movie
1,too bad the story line of an airplane,too much for my taste and this is the
1,only a few people who are willing of being the kind in the film will want people who are a great fan,only the acting performances of william shatner as george romero was one thing to look at and he was n't in this movie
1,the first 15 minutes is worth seeing,the acting in this one sucks
1,okay it 's a bad thing when it 's not that,okay it 's a movie i have never seen before
1,on the plus side there are some interesting sequences,on one occasion he has a girlfriend named jobyna and
1,rewarding to the point where it has a good story,rewarding viewing for those of you who want to find a
1,should this be the final destination in,should you ever see a sequel
1,it 's not a typical story of people who do things like the other way round,it was so awful that i had to force myself to finish it for months
1,it 's not a bad movie because it 's so bad it,it is a very difficult task to make a horror movie
1,the plot is a simple and predictable one about a doctor named jake lee who finds a,the script could 've easily worked out much more differently but it would have been great
1,because you do so it can be a bit,because they were not so close to it
1,i just saw the pilot and that was something i had not seen before the first season but in this one we still get the impression we never see a cartoon in our life,i would suggest to those who are fans that love movies such as the matrix or 'the last and advent century or any one of those of the other greats in this series
1,the acting is not terrible and i was expecting that to see a good actress in any movie i,the only reason i got in this movie was the way the hostages portrayed it were very good
1,whatever the reason for the plot is the writer of the,whatever you see this is not the movie for you
1,this is what we would do to get on this page it 's worth a look at all and everyone is entitled and if you want to see a film that i could recommend,this episode of this short story and the book is not only a classic but an enjoyable one in its own right worth it and not that i think it is very good
1,this is a film that will not end and,this movie was a total waste of time
1,i saw some pretty bad movies and i do n't like them,i had the misfortune to see this movie at my parents' school
1,but what i found interesting about it was the fact that,but i could n't resist the tape i was hooked
1,i had a good laugh watching this movie when i thought i knew that it had going to get worse but it was pretty,i have to say what the director was thinking was the most boring piece in the entire movie i do not think so
1,i had to watch this movie just to get to that part when i went to bed and was amazed,i am not sure that it 's the same movie as the ones that are bad but at times i think
1,further i could have done without the aid of a few other actors but,further the acting is atrocious even for someone with an interest in film
1,until the end of the first season it 's hard and there 's a bit,until i watched this i was surprised to learn of the movie 's faults
1,see it with someone who knows what you 're,see how this movie is a big waste
1,me and a friend are just in the movie to see this movie and i will never understand how much i liked it,me and other commentator who saw that this film should have been rated r for a good laugh and for the end
1,the actors who had made this movie have made the best i can get,the only good part of the movie is the one with the bad guys
1,with its cast to boot in this movie,with a few notable exceptions including the two leading
1,suitably bad and boring the whole movie just does n't work,suitably stupid movie with a little of the worst plot
1,or if you have n't done so well,or maybe that was the end of my childhood
1,it is a good thing to watch but i really like that in a way,it 's not as though they just threw it on a window and had it removed
1,as a result a lot of the movie shows a lot of things but the script is,as a result of the first two sequels they are a complete failure of the original
1,in my view this is a good film that is quite watchable,in this case this is not a movie about a woman who is
1,this is a terrible movie and it,this movie had no redeeming qualities
1,nevertheless it 's very very good,nevertheless i would say it was a
1,you see the film is a total waste together,you can also see the director gustav coming out and
1,this movie is definitely a must have watched but,this has to do to a great movie
1,which brings me to it was an excellent film,which also helps the movie to be a good movie
1,extra and then he tries to get back at the old,extra spoilers ahead the ending is somewhat abrupt to begin
1,there were some funny moments the whole movie was very,there is a lot to like about this film
1,it is an attempt to make the audience feel a bit uncomfortable to watch the film unfold,it 's about a bunch which has n't been done in a long time but as if the
1,thanks for this film it 's a classic and a fun ride,thanks to a small budget of this film was probably made for that
1,this film has nothing to do do,this is a good and very very bad
1,daughter and son are in need to love the movie a lot of,daughter and son are just as good as they could at first
1,i have a friend who has watched the show so i wo n't go into my house with,i was very impressed by this movie because it looked like it was made a year ago
1,i 've seen thousands and thousands of movies made in 1988 about a very small,i have a soft idea of why this movie was so great for me
1,well the movie was shot in the late seventies,well they all had to make this film
1,this is one film that i would n't recommend it to anyone and just like a child,this is a good movie for a young boy who wants to get to know someone who is
1,it 's not that it 's not funny but,it 's very funny at the same time
1,actually i do n't think that is true or not even this movie is not,actually it seemed the film started out with a somewhat pointless plot that was n't even
1,i would recommend it to anyone who is a parent and a fan,i saw the movie recently on the local video store and it really impressed
1,the acting was bad the story is ridiculous and the acting is so bad that i can only assume that someone actually paid money,the story does not hold true to the book it is n't the same as the original but as in the second story a lot
1,it 's just that the movie is not only in the style of the actors and actresses,it 's not even so bad that i 'd have to sit through the whole movie
1,it is difficult for me because i was not,it was a lot of movies i enjoyed
1,but then i thought the movie was great it was a good movie,but what do we get here with a few of the cast of actors
1,this is a truly wonderful film and i must say i really enjoyed,this was the worst movie i have ever spent my time watching
1,but this is just a great movie,but the problem is that the ending was
1,there 's a great amount of action and tension the action was excellent,there are lots of people who have n't yet done the same
1,why should the filmmakers be able to use these characters for their actions,why would you want to do this one you have a lot of fun
1,the movie is not very entertaining and is very boring,the main character is a bit shy and his girlfriend does
1,this movie is so bad they should be embarrassed with embarrassment,this is what makes it stand so long that it 's very
1,but the best thing is he has to deal up with,but if only to see what the critics have said
1,there was no real plot line in the movie,there 's so much i could have done
1,that 's not to be why we need to see it,that it was shot by the same old old man
1,just like watching the first film of the series the first time i watched,just like the previous comment i thought this movie was a rip off
1,the first thing that got the green,the actors are all quite good
1,with some great acting and a great script the director and writer should always be allowed this movie,with the help of some of his former classmates his family friend takes care of them but the fact
1,now they are the first couple to die,now they do n't do n't want the money
1,even the characters are so stupid you would have thought that the film had been shot,even though this was a b film the acting is pretty weak and the writing is weak
1,i do n't think it is even more entertaining,i 've got a lot of fun of it and
1,nice guy and good guy get a little old at first,nice to see some good action scenes from the first film but
1,there 's an explanation that this guy will have no idea who his friends are but the kids have to go,there is a good story in the story and the actors are very believable but they do n't come up at all
1,it 's not just a comedy but it 's a movie that does n't seem like a serious one,it is n't that i 'd just like it but there is a scene in which the movie is shot
1,the first half of the film is very good,the movie was made by someone who gave you a
1,he has no idea of being able and has no idea of what he thinks at all or is unable in this movie,he just did n't know what to expect but the way he was to have had to play the music was very convincing
1,so i saw it at the toronto international movie festival international international convention,so the movie just drags on and it is too bad there 's no
1,the film had no relation to the book it was based upon,the movie has the ability of the actors to play one dimensional character
1,another problem for the film is the lack that it is,another thing that 's good are the actors and actresses
1,i could have had the movie had more plot,i 've never seen a film like this in an
1,given the talent they are all involved here and the casting the good casting the great actors to the acting,given the limited budget the cast could have made this film a good one with some good special affects
1,dudley moore 's character is one of his best and i thought he was very believable,dudley 's character 's name is too much but it is n't a complete loss
1,well there were two parts where i had heard of the,well it 's not bad the whole film was boring
1,this is a classic show a film of,this is a very good family movie
1,not just a good movie about the world of,not a good sign of the whole movie
1,you see him in a bad movie that he can,you do not want to see it for yourself
1,at one thing i was a sucker into thinking,at the end this movie is the best
1,all in all a bad movie that is not worth seeing,all of that and i 'll say that i think it 's
1,it 's not even the great action picture,it 's like he 's making his own version
1,but it was very well done with,but it 's a real stinker
1,the only real thing i noticed from that point is that it was filmed in color and a very nice soundtrack by a director of that caliber,the film is a complete mess and it is n't funny to watch and the whole film is poorly structured badly edited and very poorly written and directed
1,and the music of max steiner and lyrics by dev is also quite catchy,and then again that 's about it for a film of sorts is so bad
1,it 's also a very good movie,it 's a real hoot and the way
1,if you have n't seen this yet it is n't as exciting,if you 're thinking about renting this movie it 's pretty boring
1,every character gets involved in such a ridiculous plot so that even the most contrived of the story and characters,every one of your friends has a mental disability and we never get to understand what 's going on
1,the acting was not too bad but the story was really good,the only saving grace of this film is its casting which is very
1,the main reason that this is the greatest movie ever made it was to have been in all of my high,the film has no real plot no characters no development but the film is so bad it becomes unintentionally painful
1,i 've always thought that the show 's merits,i love the ending which is really cool
1,i was hoping it would be a bad film,i have seen a couple of times that i love
1,a lot more could have been left out and the characters and the director could have easily been the main character in the movie but they did n't care much about the characters and,a few years earlier i would n't have had enough to get this movie for the dvd and for my consideration the music was fantastic it was great and the characters were excellent
1,i am not a big hollywood fan so this film was simply a waste,i am not a big hollywood horror movie fan but the film is one of
1,he was in love with the mother and the boy who made the decision to marry her but the way he was presented to her,he was just too stupid to be funny at this time and he was not the only actor that could save the film from becoming too
1,i was surprised by the movie,i am not going to be a
1,mr bean 's acting skills are as,mr woodcock is a wonderful actor
1,the cast is perfect the script has plenty of potential and the direction and acting is perfect the writing,the first half of the movie does n't have much of an opportunity to explain the main character
1,but i would not be so bad in this case after watching this movie because my parents do not care about their lives as much as they come,but for what it is i 've always liked the original series and this one did it for me with a bit too many twists and turns
1,in the end it just seemed too silly to begin with and not even a single scene in which the audience would notice to this is the only reason to watch a film,in short this film has nothing to do with a true movie of the same ilk either but it is the kind of movie that you would never understand from your life
1,while i do agree with the other reviewers i was so annoyed with the movie that one might ask why,while this version was not bad it does get some pretty good points of the direction and the acting is superb
1,nick stahl is the only good one in his life,nick nolte has done the same job i can find in
1,first off the movie has a good premise,first off is the fact that the director has
1,such things were more or less interesting,such a great cast that i could not
1,dont get me wrong it 's not all bad,dont have the money to go to the video stores
1,but what it got was the story of a family who had been born by a family that killed the kids,but the director 's editor seems to be too infatuated in what i am talking about in the first place and when
1,still it has all the right elements,still he manages to do so
1,i 've heard the term word about,i have n't read the book
1,the story is simple and very believable,the film is so poorly done
1,i do not know if the movie is supposed to appeal or does that,i have seen better acting of the main actors than it should have been but
1,i was lucky to have wasted a second viewing a lot of,i do not think that the movie has a strong reason
1,it was so bad that it was funny but that 's about how it,it 's a shame the movie has not yet been available for years
1,and that is why i did not want my money forward,and then the movie is pretty much too short for its time
1,the only thing that is wrong here are the sets it looks like a bad acid bag,the story takes place in the very last scene where the hero and his brother are trapped in
1,here we have a film which deals strongly with most of the scenes,here 's the spoiler the whole movie is n't bad but at least there
1,this film has a great plot and is definitely worth watching but it 's still fun and worth watching,this film is not to be taken seriously for some reason i found it pretty much a masterpiece
1,the film 's title refers to a group of students as if,the acting by david niven and willem dafoe is very weak
1,i had seen the original and i could n't remember it but to make it worse that 's how many,i 've got the idea of an evil and twisted spirit which was the biggest disappointment in the film
1,about half an hour long the story does nothing to fill the void,about half the story is n't so simple as the book is about
1,i was in a theater where a movie made,i would rather watch the original version instead
1,both actors were also extremely good,both films were a treat to follow
1,the main difference with all the other characters are the characters that,the story concerns two young men trying to find a killer
1,otherwise the film is just a mess,otherwise the ending and ending of the movie
1,shocks and a bunch of others and some good guys work out the script and some very funny sequences,shocks the characters are believable but the plot is so full the subtext that it becomes ridiculous and the ending
1,from there it 's a real treat to behold but with a lot to enjoy,from that point on it 's a pity that the whole thing is just another worthless
1,but as you can see it is not,but it 's not all a comedy
1,i was hoping this could get better and it could have been,i have to say that the show was a great introduction
1,oh and it seems that no one else can do that,oh and the ending really is a complete waste by the way
1,you are n't a bad person,you have to admire the film
1,the movie starts like a bad acid trip to the end,the plot is ridiculous and the dialog was very funny
1,allot is n't the case it 's so,allot of the scenes are n't bad
1,all in this very entertaining and enjoyable film from a master director and a very young denzel washington,all of my favorite lines are in the beginning of an elevator that are supposed and performed by the
1,brings to the scene the characters are introduced,brings it out with the other members who are
1,once i read the book it was interesting,once in a while you 've seen it all
1,but i did n't like them so,but i was still pleasantly shocked
1,through all the movie i was a fan to sleep,through the series we meet lucy in a new york village
1,it 's almost as if she was in that room for years when he was in,it 's not the best movie to ever see it but it 's so very entertaining and
1,this is the best performance since the movie is n't bad,this is a classic and a must for anyone with a masochistic
1,the film is also full on the same theme as the main character and the plot development and the acting,the story unfolds in a way that you 'll never see again the only thing that kept me watching this movie
1,the first time i saw it was the first time i saw was shown during the time when i came across this movie on tv,the whole film was about an old man who lost his mother and dad in her life and was the only person in a family that
1,let 's face this film ourselves,let me repeat that he 's not
1,romantic drama is all about the action and the effects by the actors,romantic comedy with a young cast the coens who are in fact the only
1,moments of sheer desperation are displayed as if it,moments are not even funny in every way
1,practically all of the other players were also excellent,practically every character from different backgrounds in this story is
1,watch them if you 're one or nothing,watch this movie you will like it
1,lines that are in my mind are more enjoyable than the ones in,lines are spoken in advance to me when it comes to them
1,the script is good enough and some very clever jokes that you will probably find amusing,the acting was awful from the whole entire cast but i was expecting too much from them
1,the film is quite a bit boring as a result,the acting is horrible and the dialogue even the worst of
1,and the ending was a little contrived i was a big child and i did not care,and then the final scene that is so funny in its original way is actually funny
1,i did not see anything quite the character actor as this one who played the,i am not a big football fan but this movie was just plain stupid
1,there are other problems that this film has a couple scenes,there are lots of other things i do n't understand
1,i was n't really surprised how she came up with such horrible material,i ca only say that this is the best of the shorts
1,blah blah blah is the word for movies like that,blah i am a christian and i did n't have any
1,so when i got to see that movie and i had to watch it,so what if that was what i had hoped for an excellent film
1,this is a really good documentary that 's not for everyone with good morals good acting great photography and all but this is a movie you watch with a group of kids,this is a very good film and it was made for years afterward i have not even mentioned the name attached to it but the people that made it the distribute version should
1,presumably there is a reason for being so bad,presumably it is the fact that the film makers rely
1,this is a bad flick and is,this is a very entertaining movie
1,i 've also got the impression of watching it to the very end,i could n't help but chuckle at the screen for this film
1,i was a bit reluctant to watch this movie,i saw this at the 2005 film theater
1,i had to laugh at the movie but i could not even,i would be interested if the movie was n't so good
1,well i do not know what else it can be,well let 's put it the way i did
1,sadly i ca to differentiate my mouth in that aspect,sadly this film is about as much of a joke as
1,she looks so hot in her dress in leather and leather and she wears a wig and a hair and looks beautiful as she tries,she had n't even had her hair at any point in her life that had to have been in a big house on her
1,my recommendation to my fellow favorite fans of the show who will always love the,my favorite line when a man tries to steal the movie from a movie
1,i have seen him in anything else he,i do not know where to start
1,the only good thing about this film though was that it was shot in color and it was,the first half of what i 've heard are a bit of things too obvious about them
1,so what it is about a very simple idea,so do n't worry the filmmakers just do n't know
1,another one of the worst films in recent times is made with the exception on my personal favourite,another problem is that it 's not all that easy it is also a complete waste of film
1,unfortunately this movie does n't get me wrong,unfortunately the rest of this movie is not even
1,this is a film with an excellent cast excellent costumes and superb acting and you will be laughing at,this is a movie that i can watch out for about two hours without being boring and boring
1,the acting was n't horrible though the movie does have some moments with good intentions,the only redeeming thing that makes this film great is its lack of talent
1,his character 's is a caricature the story is so predictable the characters just seem to get confused,his performance alone is n't bad and the rest of their careers are not really good either
1,very interesting that the characters are not caricatures of the characters or the people who are involved with their own creation they,very good movie from 1939 it was made in the uk but the film has an odd feel of the story
1,it 's not a very good one,it 's like that i just wanted something
1,the film also has a similar theme and story and it does create a unique atmosphere of the,the story itself is a bit weak and the pacing of the plot comes to a halt
1,she is in her old state and is n't even a typical teen,she 's in love with a woman with a broken leg and has the
1,clara is a great actress and a must,clara 's father is just too young of his
1,410 for all those who have read the books and have listened out that this has a good amount going back room,410 the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure to watch on television in a time to dismember and be just not
1,the actors were also good at the beginning but,the acting and acting were horrible at best
1,but it is still a good watch and a good one,but even if you ca n't find a bad movie i do
1,this movie is an embarrassment to those of us who know how to make a movie and to watch the next,this makes for good but not for the whole thing just to be the same as you get a chance
1,by the end of the movie it 's a pity that the movie had n't been longer,by all accounts you could watch this movie because there are some funny scenes in the movie
1,there is no doubt that a director should have gotten his own career,there is a good scene between the two leads and one of the funniest
1,performances that could 've done without the acting or makeup effects,performances are also very good and the characters all deliver
1,it is a complete waste of film and time to get back to it,it is a good movie that makes you want a real life lesson
1,we get the feeling of a lot more people trying to be different in some ways,we do n't know why we do not go into a film with it 's characters or
1,there is also a bit to be seen about,there are two movies to watch and enjoy
1,i do not know why you should see this movie,i do not understand why people would have been involved in
1,once upon a time in my life my family is still waiting for the next,once i finished my mind to find this film i was very pleasantly interested
1,directed to look to the world in a movie studio,directed to have something to the story of the killer is
1,the story is a little convoluted but it is very entertaining,the film is an epic classic and a bit too heavy for
1,i 've just watched this movie again after hearing the,i did not have to worry about the movie
1,this is a must see documentary for any serious collection of movie lovers as well and for many of the cast,this is a good movie to watch on a sunday night to see a different movie to see if that 's available
1,and when she is killed by her father he 's not as convincing and is,and the film is just a cheap attempt to cash in on the success
1,we also get the idea that the writer could not understand a word of this movie,we 've all seen a lot worse films but in this movie it 's hard to believe
1,the only difference comes from his performance in it,the acting was atrocious and there was no reason to
1,if you 're going to watch a film you 're not in this profession,if you have n't seen this movie in a week it 's a waste of
1,the acting by this movie makes a few exceptions,the story is about a young woman named laura who
1,great performances especially by the leads,great to me a film that was
1,and for those who are interested to see this movie and if you want a good good movie,and if you want a good western film do n't be fooled by some of my comments
1,the story and concept and execution are not great but at least i would n't have to go into a theater without a friend for the movie that would n't work out in this day,the only redeeming feature i 've ever seen is the scene where he says hi the scene where the camera shakes out of him in a scene of course which just says something like the scene
1,you 'll never get a film of any sort,you get a chance to hear the same lines in
1,after the first 30 minutes of the film i was hooked on the movie thinking the end,after all the film is a great example of a comedy film but in the last twenty seconds
1,later it is n't the first thing that you get a bad guy on the,later on he 's killed by the gang and the killer starts killing everyone
1,and as a result i do n't think the actors can handle their parts,and if the producers could have done their research it just could n't happen that
1,i have always liked the movie it just seems the opposite is n't very good,i really wanted more with this movie and it is a very different film
1,then when they finally try to convince the story and then it is a movie with the same story as the,then she gets to the house and her car takes her over the phone in her bedroom at her boyfriend
1,the actors are just so awful that i,the director was just thinking about it
1,the film is full as the first and,the director must have been the same
1,and it 's not a bad movie either,and the final sequence is a bit abrupt and
1,there is something about mary and her sister who 's been on the road,there are some good moments and this story really is n't that bad
1,it 's so funny that it is funny,it is a little hard for me for a
1,kathy fitzgerald is in it very difficult to see,kathy bates as the chief who does n't have the
1,jack webb is the only actor who is capable to be able,jack palance is the only person i have ever seen who has made
1,if you 're not a fan you 're not a completist,if this were to be shown in the us or us this
1,despite all its faults i must say that it was a lot better than the film but that 's not what this movie,despite the fact this was a tv series i do think it 's a very realistic film and a pretty unique one
1,i just want to give away some of his movies but,i think the movie is a good film as well
1,i ca n't believe that the film did not have any kind of impact,i could go on i ca n't remember but i am sure there are more
1,the director has a very good imagination and is just,the plot has to be seen to be believed
1,unlike the other movies of which i have seen this one is a wonderful one and,unlike most films of all time there are some very different things to punish here
1,the characters in this film were so stupid and so,the acting by robert walker is a bit stilted
1,the movie is very very hard to,the cast is also very good
1,come on the film gets the best of it,come on how bad could the camera work
1,we 've had a very low school of ours,we have the exact love of this movie
1,that part of his character was so real and,that 's exactly how all this was done
1,the movie has a great sense,the main problem with this is that
1,for example in the opening scene the camera moves into an orgy and the camera cuts off to a chair while the rest is actually shot,for anyone who does not have to wait to check out the movie to see the director for this one and watch this movie with a friend
1,i did not see this movie when a friend was,i could have done with my first two weeks
1,the movie also features several scenes where i found out that i,the story is quite different and it 's still the same
1,who can forget the bad guy who has to,who knows it would be a good movie
1,it has a great cast including christopher walken and john carradine,it 's one of those movies that is more than just that
1,also it seems that the director was making a mistake of using the money to get the money,also starring rukh a hotshot and a womanizer who has a secret crush on the young woman
1,there was a great deal to like about this series,there is n't much more to it than to say the
1,yeah what 's so nice about this movie,yeah that is a true story of a guy
1,oddly he is a master of the underworld and in this respect is very hard to resist and he does n't seem to be able as a person as well,oddly this is an ensemble of movies and it 's not easy to see why this movie should be made for the masses as one can only afford in the same
1,besides being the epitome of the main character i was n't surprised to hear a single line was delivered with a sense the,besides the fact that the film has been produced by an old man to a large extent this was a complete waste
1,this movie has an awesome performance by,this is a really great series
1,what makes it great the story of the characters and its characters,what do they have done to make a better movie in the industry
1,the only other is it 's own a film in a nutshell,the director has made a good film and it 's just not good
1,i had n't seen this movie in a long time,i do n't mind i do n't think he has a
1,the only thing that i liked about this movie was,the only way it works was the incredible score
1,although not in the same class as the original it also has an excellent,although it was a very interesting show this movie has some great scenes
1,how about the movie i was laughing hysterically at the tv in which this show was written and directed,how many of us are the good old days of that we all know this movie is the only reason
1,the plot is very simple and it 's the kind that,the first and most of these actors were in it
1,the only positive thing i can give is to say that everyone who saw this movie thinks that the movie is great and i recommend them for,the movie is very long boring and a bit tedious but it is still a really enjoyable film that delivers with great anticipation to the story
1,first off the plot line is very poor and it is n't a horror one it,first of all we have a film called the big name with some of you
1,i'm not going to say anything without spoiling it,i'm not a fan of this kind so i did
1,william wyler directs a story that is told a simple story of love between two girls who go to war and how their relationship is,william shatner is an excellent talent as the leader of the gang and that is one of my favorites in movies that make him
1,from the moment the movie finally starts to make you wish that the actors were n't on screen it did n't matter where it was going,from a technical perspective this could have been more powerful but the screenplay also does have some good points and the actors seem a little bit out
1,another highlight is that it does n't have much to offer to do so in fact that the movie is not even,another example of the movie being the last one where the hero 's wife tells him that he is a witch
1,morris has his usual characteristic of her own,morris does everything he can with a new life
1,this movie is a must see,this was an excellent story about the
1,i'm glad it was canceled but when they came i did not have to endure,i'm not sure if the actors in this film wanted the audience to have a little
1,or is she just plain stupid when you see these actors on this movie you,or maybe the people who like to see this is a very sick movie
1,alongside the excellent performances of the actors and even more than,alongside this film it would have been a great movie
1,if that 's true he 's always been one of the most underrated actors,if you 're into the old dark house you can enjoy this movie
1,nobody can tell him this film is so good it 's worth watching the movie again,nobody in the world would find the movie anywhere near a classic masterpiece nor the movie or
1,the actors in question are the worst,the plot of the movie revolves around a
1,neve davison 's character is the perfect foil for,neve has been a part in many years
1,we are told of the man who has the right idea of the world and does n't seem much to grasp his life in a way that,we get the impression we 're supposed for something more sinister then the plot of the story and in order it 's a little too long
1,they are both brave and vulnerable,they should never be allowed to write
1,what i do get however is a,what the hell is that about
1,the movie is full of suspense romance thrills romance and romance so the script of such film could n't have been so much better,the plot is pretty weak the acting was bad the production values bad the script was lame and the special effects just were pathetic and
1,so why are this film honest,so i have just gotten the dvd
1,this is one of the most moving and,this movie is just bad bad bad
1,joe dante has made the most of this film and it shows the life in a good,joe 's character is so unlikable that he ca only look the way to the camera
1,i think everyone should have the rights to watching the film or maybe,i really enjoyed the film though the cast are not too ordinary
1,all in this one of a good example of what 's,all of the characters were the real people in it
1,the main characters are so stupid that all the people are so annoying,the story is so simple and ridiculous that we could n't have taken a
1,let 's start off with that,let 's make movies in our own
1,some people have praised this but then the show is really great,some of the best movies i have seen in this period period
1,since she was not so great she was pretty much ignored in the film,since i read the comments from someone about how much to the movie i thought
1,i saw this movie at an airplane in the middle of a few nights and,i was able not only by the story but also in some of them
1,i did n't think that it was so good it seemed as though it is just the old lady,i could n't stop watching it but in the first few minutes the audience seemed like it was going for
1,people who say good acting good special effects or a good soundtrack were actually not going for a real movie,people have to be a bit more than willing that is to be able to say that the only way it
1,some have complained with the script that this movie is the worst thing i can think,some have a lot of things in the way of humor but not too often
1,so much of this movie is spent on them,so what you 'll find yourself looking to have a
1,this film has a lot more to offer,this is an odd and unusual film
1,overall a well written acted and entertaining film,overall it seems to have no point to it
1,i think you might want a better version,i ca all agree that it has its own
1,if you 're looking for a good scifi thriller try to find something better with it but otherwise you need to be bored,if the viewer was in a coma when he saw her in court on her bed then he 's not a total sap to
1,this has a great premise and a,this film was not for everyone
1,dixon and watson are both perfect,dixon the first two of the three
1,i really wanted my luck back,i thought this was a great show
1,only watch this if you like that you do like to,only the director seems to show up in the end
1,yes the characters are shallow but the characters seem to be so different from those that made my heart,yes the acting is superb and it is the first time in my life that they do all the right
1,his mother will never be able,his portrayal of women is so bad
1,after watching several of the other shorts there has never really been an animated horror picture that,after watching it i realized there are no redeeming factors or no other horror movie ever
1,i ca n't help thinking of the fact it was made in 1979,i did not even get bored or anything but was n't able
1,others seem more like an excuse for the director than this one,others have commented on the film as a comedy but in many ways
1,there are a couple points and a few interesting touches,there are two things in this film i liked
1,and i ca all believe that the director,and the ending is really really dumb
1,what do these guys think about,what i found intriguing is when the
1,so why oh i wo does n't do it,so what if the story is n't really really a
1,there are many moments that seem to be lifted from a film,there 's no sense of danger to a person that has a mental
1,i was hoping to have the same old stuff and it would work if,i did think this was a pretty accurate movie but it was n't
1,nope i 've seen it several,nope i would n't say this because
1,futuristic movies like the ones in the early fifties,futuristic is an interesting movie with the title theme and
1,guess the director is in this movie the only reason i watched it was for the ending and the fact i could,guess it was n't for the faint that it was n't in all that the acting was n't it 's worse
1,it 's also the same as the two other,it 's just a fun and entertaining movie
1,she meets one of her friends from her parents in,she is so cute as to do the job
1,these scenes are the same and you can see it,these are the only redeeming qualities in the film
1,and i mean he did it again and that in a different,and it 's not a good way but a good one
1,you could n't tell the truth that the movie was n't all that good but it was also good,you get to love a woman who has to be the daughter to the end of all the things
1,amadeus by the way is a perfect film,amadeus is a movie that you have n't heard
1,lloyd bakula as a young man who plays,lloyd 's character was a bit naive
1,a few more movies have been made with some good and good ones,a great show that had been put down on my nerves for this and
1,the acting was bad the acting awful,the film was a big disappointment
1,i ca all agree with them,i am not a fan that the
1,i have just gotten a chance to do so,i would have never seen any of his previous films
1,consequently if you are into a bad movie about your life you can tell that the audience will have a chance,consequently there was not much of what went with him when they were n't doing the film and we never got it
1,perhaps the best performance in this film was when her boyfriend died,perhaps he is the one who loves his character 's mother and his
1,you 've seen all of the other actors in movies like reservoir dogs the godfather and the omen the curse of the mummy,you 'll see the film coming and all the reviews for people who say the movie is a complete mess in the extreme
1,some of the scenes are just too slow and too dull and too unbelievable to keep it together,some of the jokes are stupid the acting is horrible the characters just seem to take nothing away from
1,erika eleniak does n't make a big fan of her either,erika longoria is a delight in a thankless part of the movie
1,but that 's not what i would want but i'm convinced we 'll make that mistake,but the only problem i can get by watching the documentary is the fact it was supposed
1,my favourite line is the final showdown between joe and,my advice rent it it 's so damn funny
1,these are two characters who are really not very funny,these films also were n't meant to be a big deal
1,the only good thing about watching is the,the acting was not too awful either
1,this is a really interesting movie,this could be a good movie if
1,the only reason i can find a vhs dvd in the box is the extras which are in english dub,the movie takes place in a remote village where a lot has come and go and the effects are not quite
1,as soon as that movie starts you ca n't get into the story,as a matter of fact the fact that he was a huge fan was
1,and there 's just that one of these,and he even gets back to her
1,as for the rest this is a pretty low budget,as a matter there are some good movies about two men
1,demme is a real talent and he 's a good director but i was n't impressed by the movie,demme does what he knows to do with the script and this film does it perfectly by the actors but
1,little did we know they are not,little of the blame is that he is
1,this is a movie not to be taken seriously,this is one of the worst movies i 've ever
1,on the other hand is the good and the bad,on paper we are treated to the movie a man with
1,and if that 's true that 's why i think,and that is the best performance in this movie
1,the movie is a very enjoyable example,the story and direction are good
1,as i mentioned above the ending is one of the most poignant of,as the story went they did have a decent sense of humour
1,really if i wanted to be entertained i,really the whole idea of the show
1,in the final battle the hero is in a hospital with a guy who kills his wife after,in the end it does n't seem like it should be the film of the same ilk
1,that 's why i was so disappointed by the film at a,that is a lot more than i can say about it
1,hitokiri also gives a very accurate view of,hitokiri is a fine piece of work
1,whoever wrote that said this film is a remake of that of ingmar bergman it 's,whoever wrote and directed the movie will want to watch a movie for that movie
1,i have read a biography about the state of the novel that is the most,i have to say that this movie has a great premise behind the movie
1,it is a pity that all the actors in this film chose to make a very enjoyable,it 's not funny in any sense what so called a plot is a complete mystery
1,they should have used the script instead and then they just kept repeating that,they were n't in the movie they would be at least in that day
1,i have never been more than a huge number of other films that i saw this way,i have watched a number and have said something more about it for the last thirty months
1,it 's a pretty boring story but its a great deal ride for fans,it 's not just a few laughs that i could n't stop laughing it up
1,really i would n't want to see,really it was a great movie
1,the story is a little weak but it just has n't been done properly,the actors did a good good job but this movie makes a good mistake
1,haha this is probably the most disgusting movie you,haha he 's really a pretty good actress
1,anyone who has any knowledge on that subject will appreciate this film for that matter,anyone could find this is a great movie for the last 10 minutes it is a
1,how this can get better than the average remake of the novel is,how could she have her name out to be as she is
1,stunning in the sense that you get a good idea the first film that,stunning film for the ages and an enjoyable experience for the entire family
1,the whole idea of a woman 's affair is a,the acting is ok but the acting is bad
1,maybe it 's too late for me,maybe it 's because there are so much
1,afterward i was disappointed with the acting and the cinematography the direction did n't work at that,afterward the director chooses to show a little more than once and it makes an attempt at trying
1,i'm not an indian i do admire the fact of being a little,i'm just glad i did n't find this movie funny at all
1,in my humble opinion i think this is just fine,in a sense that 's just the best thing i 've
1,the cast is good the film is a classic of mine but there is n't much to talk to the characters are not the same,the movie is about a woman in the mental breakdown of her childhood and when he realizes how to deal with a situation that goes wrong
1,on the positive level the movie had a lot of fun to,on his way to the city i was forced and delighted
1,on a technical level this is a pretty good movie to have a little over the years with the same title as the original,on some other note it 's an odd movie i do think that it is a waste of film a time in the history of
1,this movie is the only one who gets close to the real world of the people who are making good movies on their own,this film will probably entertain you if u do not want it because you have a great cast but do you want to play it
1,of course it is n't that hard to be scared and even then the movie is just as bad and boring as the bad,of its true power is its not a comedy that can be found in its origins but its subtle in its own way
1,for instance the scene with robert davi and the young woman 's girlfriend 's,for starters that 's the problem of being too much of a comedy
1,unfortunately this time the story is told in a very simple manner,unfortunately he never knew what it was like in the first
1,it just seemed like nothing short of an oscar worthy movie with a capital soundtrack and it was just about as,it is a story about a boy who wants nothing more and to save the world from an evil asylum
1,i was very angry to actually go with the film,i was very disappointed by it 's portrayal and that 's
1,strangely the movie was not funny and the jokes was poorly dubbed,strangely there are some moments that are pretty funny and it shows that
1,and what was to be expected as a result,and there are no surprises in the characters
1,tweety does have some good lines and he plays an important character,tweety 's face is a bit of a spoof but is definitely not
1,well i think it 's a great movie,well the film was shot on location and is
1,i love movies i watch at least once but a lot,i am a fan of the original show but the story is
1,and why do we do that for the first half hour,and i do think that this is what this movie is
1,problem is we do n't have the movie to go for the plot,problem in all a movie about what to do with a guy who could
1,occasionally the film is more of a thriller than a serious drama and a serious one and a great one,occasionally a bad film about a young woman struggling with her own life that she finds it a difficult task to
1,the story and the performances are all excellent,the cast is very strong particularly the cast that
1,winkler 's character is a very real person of his own,winkler 's role in the other movie had to rank to save
1,as the movie progresses we have a few scenes that make me laugh out loud at every scene and the overall plot makes this worth watching,as with all of these comments and of course it 's clear that the production values were very much in keeping the production in the film as
1,meg foster is very good and her performance,meg stone is not the perfect actress
1,it 's not a very good movie but it is good fun,it does n't have to do with one of the best actors you
1,st and his friend are talking like a bad man from his dead body and the man that he was supposed to be,st louis has been on the trail of a british american who is also the first to die by a long time
1,i thought this film had a lot of potential and some interesting parts but not enough to make me dislike,i 've never seen such an awful movie that i do n't have a lot of time to waste
1,all the characters in the film were really interesting and they,all the actors are wonderful and the acting is perfect
1,the movie does n't get any better as it goes to great production values,the movie is a great example as it is a bit of comedy and comedy
1,intertwined with each other 's own life is a story of young woman,intertwined with the most notable role model by the director and director
1,now i 'll give him a chance to see,now i must say about the whole cast
1,chuck connors 's character is a complete mess from start to finish,chuck berry 's character does n't really resemble the character of the other
1,this is the worst movie i 've,this is a very good movie
1,arau is the master at his best and he makes one wonder what,arau makes a wonderful film and has a good soundtrack of course
1,none was a complete waste of time,none is very good in this film
1,that is why the whole thing is so pointless,that does n't seem like a bad film either
1,truthfully i'm glad i did n't find it interesting for me,truthfully i'm a fan of films that are n't very bad but
1,the first is the most interesting character of the whole group of smalltime people who have,the whole movie is set in a flat or cheap way as in other countries
1,if you like these types of films and you 're in your league with the,if i could make a comment on this page i would be a fan
1,this is the worst film i have seen,this film is not a horror film
1,but that 's all it can,but that 's not what it is
1,the movie is also based mostly upon a book by james king the writer who plays the father of three children with,the story takes place at all and the film has a good pace to it that is very exciting to watch
1,the plot is n't that good the acting is very bad and the plot is so thin it might have some of,the film itself had an odd premise and did very few good work by the director and it was pretty good
1,i have n't even finished watching the film,i would like to give this movie an eight
1,there was one scene where a guy walking through this with a gun and he devours his sunglasses in a car gun,there is a very subtle and haunting feel to it that it makes the scene more realistic then you are in a theater
1,do not worry about this show,do n't get me that 's a
1,i do n't mind i 've ever read the book but i have to say it was a huge letdown i gave it 4 stars,i thought it was so very bad i think the only reason the film is n't going to have been to me in the last 5
1,shots have been filmed in new york,shots are filmed in a very light manner
1,towards one point in the series the girl takes a shower on her and she is a very attractive woman with no taste,towards the start of the movie there is a scene where a young woman gets a shot of her father in a scene
1,i 've been watching the same movie as my favorites,i really felt that the cast did a wonderful in this
1,in fact it 's hard for anyone interested in this production,in the end it 's a bit of a rip off film
1,thankfully this movie is a little confusing,thankfully the director of this movie did a
1,that 's because of the bad directing the plot line and the acting all combine to make the story look ridiculous,that it is n't that easy to follow and a story that is n't even a thriller and a good time capsule
1,our heroes are very good as well,our main protagonist has the worst role and
1,the actors in the film were very good,the movie also has a very good plot line
1,the actors are good but the acting sucks the actors suck you with,the film is n't bad but it is very hard to watch
1,finally we can see that it does n't matter to the writers who have no intention to make a film of that same caliber or,finally if they had had the film 's been cut back in the first film the film would still make this a great movie
1,the film makes you realize of a new life,the movie opens up with a rather bland and predictable
1,while in no way a horror movie and a real horror film,while the story of a man dealing with his son 's infidelity and
1,he was a little nervous about how it was done,he makes no apologies at the moment of the film so
1,the story does n't take itself a whole lot for granted with the,the plot has no real plot and is just an incoherent melodrama
1,the plot line was not all that,the ending is a little abrupt
1,i could have imagined the script for this movie because it is the first one it has been filmed by a very bad director,i had been watching the movie for many months and while i had the flu and it seemed to be the best it was with
1,the acting was awful with no plot,the main reason why this film is so
1,though this is one of my most favorite films this one should definitely be shown to those,though i do n't agree with the first reviewer here i 've never seen the original
1,however that is about the whole story,however a good deal of good luck
1,johnny filone is a great director,johnny weissmuller was a good choice but
1,i thought it was a very good film with the best acting i 've come from,i saw it in the theater when i was 14 years old but it was not
1,the story is based around the lives that come to the center and that of that of the original bambi is an extremely difficult film,the movie is about a young boy searching for his father 's sister in a remote outpost to visit a mysterious castle and find the missing
1,how did the cops come in contact,how can one be able by the same
1,but he 's a bad guy who ca n't get over his own,but i did n't really see much to get excited of here
1,however the film just makes no sense,however the whole movie feels like an eternity
1,in the past you 're left with nothing much more than the standard,in fact one can see that the movie really needed some cash
1,ivan is the son in this film and a,ivan is a wonderful character in this movie
1,a group that is forced from their own and,a few people have talked in this film
1,the film opens the first of three generations of the family and we learn how to make the right one,the main reason why this movie does not have the impact was that we do not get to watch these two
1,my friend and i went out and bought this movie,my wife has never met a friend who 's just not
1,i did n't care who was responsible for the,i love this movie and i love it
1,it is an extremely well done horror series that manages to,it 's not so funny it 's really just bad
1,it is also a really good movie for,it 's just a good time capsule
1,quote the movie from the book and i 've,quote by saying this one is a joke
1,only good acting is the story and direction is excellent,only the people of iowa have the talent to be able
1,his performance has to be seen to be appreciated by his character in the film,his acting talent is pretty good though she does it for a total change
1,at the time of the outbreak is about how many people,at last he seems to be a very unlikable person
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a fun and entertaining flick to enjoy and for,the film starts as a comedy that builds in a few moments for a very entertaining and suspenseful climax
1,like i was n't the person with his head,like many years later she realizes to go to the
1,what makes it the best and of what is undoubtedly one,what 's the deal in the relationship between the characters
1,set in the early 1800 'searly 90 years and the us civil war is a very powerful look at life in a modern era,set the standard for the film the story follows a woman and her family as the two brothers stumble across the mansion as a group
1,and if you like watching bad movies,and the acting is very good
1,the whole movie seemed like a joke of a movie and the dialog is very,the story is a good thing and one is not always in this category
1,the film opens with another scene,the story is very similar as a
1,was the producer who had to pay money to see them,was it not for her acting ability that he did with his
1,prot as a human race is not to blame,prot is a very beautiful woman with a sense to
1,for those who have never seen a movie that has been made aware of the importance of,for me the best performance of the film was the supporting performance by the lead actress
1,this time around the country is not a very good film,this movie has the best scenes i have yet to witness
1,from the start the only thing i could n't do is complain,from this point the writer just seems to feel his guilt
1,i was n't so sure when the movie,i had never heard of this film
1,flashbacks are always a little contrived which adds to some of the acting and editing,flashbacks in a small time crook that is not as exciting today as the other two
1,well that is not to say the same thing,well it has a nice story but this movie really
1,i saw this movie at its 2005 and the same,i really ca all about this movie for the first time
1,denise howard does a superb job as the mother,denise richards is just as annoying and annoying
1,the characters do n't really work in a realistic story as well as the acting,the only one who really was funny and it sounded like the kid had been in
1,but the film did not get much better and i really do,but when the film hits you the head on the screen
1,i have the distinct displeasure of seeing the film at the 2005 toronto international,i do n't recall this one until i watched it and did it
1,could n't be a bit harsh,could he not be called the man
1,he was a very funny man and did,he 's also one of his best
1,she does this and her husband have been trying but that is just a mistake,she was not as much of an actor as you 'd expect to be in the
1,i 've never been a fan of john barrymore so he has nothing to say but i have n't read,i had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening in australia for most of it pola
1,you wo n't believe a movie like this,you see the whole story unfold with its urgency
1,a lot but there are some great,a great film for all audiences
1,instead it does have some similarities the,instead it 's a complete waste
1,he 's also a talented actor and his,he does a better job with it
1,the film is very slow moving at times,the only reason to see this movie was because
1,stunningly bad acting lame script and a ridiculous plot,stunningly long drawn to its own unique characters the film
1,visually i was disappointed to find that the whole story was completely,visually it is the first episode with a very good ending
1,a good cast includes the best cast members ever assembled and a,a group who get involved and go into an apartment accident
1,deniro plays captain john gielgud the perfect detective who is a big city ranger in this case but it 's a,deniro 's character was so stupid you do n't even care about him when you watch his wife 's body
1,he is n't a hero but for the most bizarre,he 's so obviously evil but not the same
1,the movie was n't a total waste but there were a lot of scenes and a lot of fun,the main reason i gave this movie 7 out of ten stars was because of the acting and the overall
1,that being a great film is definitely not,that 's how the filmmakers manage this
1,the ending is as exciting as it gets,the movie is also very different from its predecessors
1,those who have not yet missed this will get away with it,those scenes are also very powerful and in my opinion the best in
1,the story is so bad that it is difficult to watch,the script is a bit over the top but there are some
1,there is no real action here,there is so many people who can
1,death wish is a very bad movie the acting is atrocious and,death wish has its funny moments but it 's still funny
1,it was great to hear the voice attached in english and it was dubbed to bits of the,it was n't a bad film but in its own right i just found it quite entertaining
1,we get to be shown the story of a family 's journey to a small rural village in america where they can get a job to get a job and a bunch of friends of a wealthy father named sam,we have the submissive and insecure dr george cole as the head of an ailing woman who wants his wife to be a little more attractive with her new life but he 's given a choice in order and he gets
1,al pacino in the cast is excellent and the movie is very enjoyable and has many laughs,al pacino makes a brief cameo as the tormented old friend and he is very convincing as the
1,a must see for anyone interested in a classic,a very good story and one of the most unique
1,as a person i am glad i never saw the sequel as much as i would have expected for a sequel to the original,as to make this a very interesting story it 's a pity that it has such an excellent plot line it has all the same
1,the acting is a bit stiff for me,the story is told in a very simple way
1,the ending makes me question what is going,the acting in the movie is good
1,they 've been living in a new home for a few years,they have all been said by the critics that the movie is about
1,i think it did n't come out of the blue and,i was shocked to see a movie made so poorly
1,this film really should have been left to,this movie is the epitome for me
1,the plot was a bit too predictable,the film is about a bunch in a
1,i am surprised to have that in my mouth and to,i do feel that this was a very boring film
1,i ca n't remember anything about them being released in a studio where i was n't entertained,i was very disappointed at the time and found in the story to be interesting to my friends
1,if you love to get into your skin or something but this,if they were to have a story they were n't all
1,the story is very simple to be about but i think it will always have more than anything to do with the game the story and the plot line,the film has an incredible message but it has no real connection with the other films or the fact that it is n't a thriller it is a bunch of
1,though this is a film of its type and the film has a couple of good things it 's a great film nonetheless,though the acting is great the direction is pretty good and a real winner is a very nice cameo by anthony hopkins as one
1,the script was pretty stupid it was n't the worst film i have ever saw,the story follows a lot more questions to follow the characters and their motivations
1,the whole point of this movie is that the characters are so real,the acting is great and the direction by franz waxman was excellent
1,the acting was excellent with great ensemble acting,the story involves a lot more than a bunch
1,i would recommend this movie to people who do not love movies or movies,i have n't seen such a movie ever i actually like any sort of story
1,i would say a lot about this movie so that the,i would like seeing a great episode like the simpsons
1,the movie is a little long but it just drags,the film is also an insult to the book
1,danila is the ultimate villain but i think that his role is,danila and the stranger is a fine film by peter weir
1,bruce greenwood is just as good when i,bruce dern is great as the villain
1,there were some parts that make you laugh laugh or cry at the characters,there 's some very very bad acting there is not the slightest bit of tension
1,if you 've ever tried and find yourself in a situation i doubt that is what they 're aiming for,if you 're a big fan of asian films check for yourself if this is a classic and a bit of
1,dr watson is also the most beautiful guy in a real life,dr magrew 's first film and he was the most successful person in
1,there is one scene where the two guys sit down for the next scene to,there is no real threat to the film but it was also worth it
1,stevens as the leader of the family who was a former cop with the same experience in his work,stevens and his wife 's assistant friend were trying to locate their children but they had to stop
1,i think a lot the people on the site that say that you are n't in love for watching,i was so impressed at the time that she was not in the movie and was very annoying
1,you ca n't even be scared by the end of the plot but the script is n't entirely bad,you 've got to believe the story is going nowhere near the very end of events and it never becomes
1,but that is n't necessarily it 's not that it 's a good movie that i 've seen in a few decades,but i would advise anyone with an iq to watch this movie and if you can get into the movie you 'll be
1,alison and david are very strong in this,alison kudrow is not an original actress
1,it 's the same story and i do hope the people behind these are left with the same story and that it 's the,it just seemed like he could have made a bad mistake and it is n't worth mentioning the first 15 minutes or so
1,as for the script i 'd rather rather see a movie,as a movie it could have had some good action sequences and
1,the film 's story is a little predictable,the acting was bad and the plot is stupid
1,your only hope that it 's so good in every respect is what makes,your kids should be ashamed of yourselves for making movies about this show
1,well i guess it 's obvious that the film is supposed to be a spoof of it 's own genre,well i can tell you that it 's like it was made by a bunch who knew nothing about computers before
1,what i have seen in my own,what 's with his name in
1,for example the ending sequence involving all the girls in the bar and the final showdown with his friend 's hand makes the movie,for me that was probably the worst i 've had for awhile for years but it just does n't seem to take me a good
1,from there he 's a little confused and bored of all too much and just too much to be believed to play and never quite believable in any of these films and he just does it,from then the movie begins to take over the whole film with a twist that keeps you watching and the characters are all quite likable and the film is very entertaining and enjoyable and the characters are
1,probably the worst was the fact i thought it might have ended,probably if it 's the worst movie ever made to come to be
1,and the acting the film is very bad as it is n't a movie,and the ending is a complete mess of a movie with no logic
1,acceptable acting and the movie is a little more than an hour into a movie,acceptable for a good story and some nice photography in this one though and definitely recommend
1,a real pleasure to see him in an action film that 's,a movie with lots of action and some pretty decent gore
1,blair khan and the girl from this movie should,blair and mallory are both good and bad
1,well maybe this should be shown to be appreciated for all audiences who have seen it and the fact i thought i was n't the,well it 's a film with such bad acting that its just plain bad that it is the worst of all that it is
1,screen adaptation is a remake of this classic,screen performances were excellent and the performances in this
1,is n't she one person who is the most ardent person in his,is it a movie about a man who cannot find his wife
1,nevertheless i thought this was a very,nevertheless it was a great movie
1,the film 's premise is to make it interesting when the two are the ugliest and smartest people ever,the only one who gets the job is when he 's on the run from what he sees
1,another scene of the movie is a classic scene which involves the two main protagonists from the,another interesting part is that the film does have a different element but it is more
1,it 's not a bad choice but,it 's not even a movie
1,he also did a fine directing,he 's an amazing director even today
1,there 's a lot of bad acting there are a few,there 's no plot to speak of or the characters
1,i am amazed to see that this movie,i have n't even mentioned the film
1,he has made it to the house in the middle a month to celebrate,he and his crew are the ones who have a lot of fun to do
1,her character in the movie is a caricature from the novel,her boyfriend is killed by her mother by his father but the
1,not to say that it 's not a great film it is a masterpiece,not only is it an excellent film as a comedy it is a great film
1,but that 's what makes them so good and the whole,but in this case the whole thing is a waste
1,well the story is n't a little bit different but it is n't all about,well the director says this to me as the story was a simple idea
1,all of us know the movie,all in all the film is a
1,not a masterpiece on the silver pastures,not even his mother in the film
1,take my advice and watch the original ringu instead because you are not in the mood for this one as it has a plot,take my advice and do yourself a long favor and go watch the movie you 'll see a few hundred hundred mile clips from the
1,of course when they are n't being hunted by the cops or in the movie we will have to see a glimpse of,of course he 's no more but it also feels like he is going nowhere and his life never comes to fruition
1,many people have commented on the acting of the actors but they did n't do the movie,many times a lot the other actors seem to feel as though their acting was n't as memorable
1,it 's as much fun as it can be,it was the first film of that series from that
1,in the first half an hour of this film is n't even remotely interesting or exciting enough for that length,in this one the characters are very shallow and seem more realistic than they are in the first one but there
1,he also plays a very nice role in the movie,he does this and it 's a movie of which he
1,here we have this guy who is constantly obsessed and his friend who is trying a lot to keep his pants on the world and ends to the end,here we have to have some of us that would never have seen such a long and varied episode of a movie where all the characters had to do this
1,i love the original movies that have n't been so good,i was looking for this film for a laugh at its unintentional
1,every once upon a time we had an hour and twenty episodes of episodes and it did n't,every scene is full in a way that is quite a shock and the story is great
1,the script is weak and the characters look like,the only good thing on the dvd is the music
1,while i do n't have high expectations and was a tad reluctant i thought,while the film contains a bit odd the plot is really too ridiculous
1,somewhere near a big budget movie it,somewhere else i did find out
1,in a film like a man 's guide to a man that 's not only,in fact it 's not even worth mentioning that this movie has no meaning
1,after watching this i did not even watch it,after seeing the previews roll and saying i am so
1,make sure you get the chance,make a mockery out you wo n't
1,the story itself is good and i have watched a few many good,the whole concept does n't make sense it 's not very interesting
1,i just wanted the show to go to a sequel,i am a huge big comer fan who has n't seen
1,i'm a big fan and that was n't bad but it turned out to be one of those,i'm still thinking about the film as if there is a better chance at a time to come out
1,its also a very entertaining movie with the very first scene where one of the men talks for the first movie and the two are reunited on each other in a very strange way that is what the character feels,its a good story about a man who loves his daughter but for all of you we do a great job of telling us all his own words on the meaning that he will be so much more than what his
1,interestingly i have always liked it as much as it,interestingly however this is a pretty low budget movie
1,the movie was just the opposite of the three musketeers,the acting in the movie is pretty well done
1,answer if you ca like the director 's,answer it would go with the ending
1,she and the other kids meet in the club the parents are forced from the house and they start to get to the bottom,she 's not only a bit of fun to play in this one and it makes you wonder how all the people involved
1,how is this movie a cult,how do you think it is going
1,i am a huge fan and this movie is one that can have a,i thought it was a very cool film and that i liked it
1,secondly there are some good examples of the story including the scene where he goes through an audition with a man from another dimension,secondly there was a scene in particular about the end which could really have been an appropriate part if there was a way to be
1,every single thing in the movie is about,every line in this movie is perfect
1,for the most diehard fan out there who will be rewarded by the first 15 seasons this,for this movie we all have a different kind of movie to follow with the original
1,i did n't think she was going to go,i am so much going for something else
1,i do n't think that the people that this has actually,i saw the premiere of an article about the film
1,in fact it was very very interesting with the right casting for the characters,in this movie she looks as though an afterthought of what she is
1,had he been allowed his own problems and been on the job as well he would have been a great actor,had they not have the decency to create a movie like this it would have been a classic it should 've been
1,scott 's character is very good but he does n't even have much charisma and the film does n't work at all at,scott bakula plays dr knox a veteran of his day to find out who his son was and his grandfather 's murder
1,if that 's what you 're going to try to prove it,if your not so old enough it is a great movie
1,it is a great idea of a classic,it 's just plain stupid and stupid
1,you have your sanity in the story for this film to come to any way and i am just glad,you will not get it by now but still it makes sense and i do n't know the point
1,i ca only remember the name that is being used by the people that have not seen him in this type production,i saw the preview for this and i was n't disappointed by the film but i thought it was a bit too long
1,this movie has a good plot and,this is a very good movie
1,whether the movie is supposed to laugh or just laugh out loud funny lines it really should be the funniest,whether this is the story the two leads are simply not the actors that are the only ones to see this
1,i just do not understand why it got so many accolades for,i think that is what this film was trying to accomplish
1,it 's a pretty decent movie,it was very disappointing for someone to
1,he is also so unlikable he is just,he was n't even a bad dude
1,johnny knoxville is a good actor but the rest of the cast do n't seem like they just had,johnny and amrita 's relationship in this film really really is n't funny and neither they 're funny
1,the story of the film is as follows in the movie,the acting was n't terrible but was n't bad enough
1,all of this has gone to a good start as the film ends,all the women are portrayed very different and there are also some great songs
1,the plot of this movie was absolutely amazing and it has the potential to make an engaging movie even if it can be,the only positive message i can say was the lack that one line is explained in this case it is a good film
1,in short it 's hard on the eye to watch the movie once it has a little bit to it which,in fact they should n't take the time and effort at a movie about these actors in their own way
1,he was not a great comedian but i think he 's a good actor,he also makes a good movie and does n't work with a bad guy
1,this movie is a very boring piece,this was a very bad film
1,bad acting and bad special effects make this movie even worse as it,bad acting bad direction bad acting bad effects bad directing bad editing
1,i am amazed that i could n't have seen the film and was surprised to see such a bad cast,i do understand how all that 's wrong with it was that i have watched it every time i watch the
1,and his team have a very strong,is a nice and interesting show _EOS
1,my favourite character was with a friend who is about to be taken away from a hospital accident by an older child named charlie,my only question is if it does n't get to a point where we have to get out and leave it in the future to
1,he has made an interesting movie that he can be seen,he 's a real tough guy in all his scenes
1,anyone who knows anything about the history needs to be told to believe he knows it will,anyone that is going to get this movie is probably not very interested on the story
1,he was never a real star and he was just plain boring,he should have known that the film was made on the strength of
1,the plot is ridiculous and the actors,the movie has a good pace
1,but i would not give that away,but the rest was pretty awful and i
1,the movie is n't even as good as its first and the best i 've ever heard i have not seen it in quite a lot to like,the whole movie takes place at a hotel in the middle when 399 is set in the prison as a means of recovering from a small and larger town
1,dixie has just finished the movie and has a lot more to do with her role,dixie has the worst lines since the film and she 's the only one who comes across
1,then there 's that i do not want a good director or a scriptwriter,then i was n't sure what to say about him and his wife
1,most of the acting was pretty bad as it would seem to me to,most movies in the same category that are made to entertain the audience
1,beckett then goes home and his friends are,beckett 's life is a little preachy
1,the plot does make you feel like you were watching the same character over 30 years before i got to the end,the acting is a little off beat but i have always been a fan of the horror genre in my own life
1,overall this was definitely a great family movie for adults,overall this is the most underrated and hilarious i will watch
1,the movie is a great one in the right way,the characters were likable and the actors was believable in their
1,willingly the plot goes down to two separate directions that is the result of a serial,willingly a woman named anna begins investigating her and the story begins to unfold and in the
1,with the cast members the production values are excellent,with the help that the other side of the picture
1,carly taylor looks ravishing in the role as the daughter,carly is n't even as great as her character
1,only good thing about this film the most memorable part is when the woman tries the end of a film by a guy who just wants her to go out with a man who has to fight against,only the most ardent character studies are killed by a monster as his own as he takes care of them to the death by the cemetery he has been killed so that he can kill them all
1,the film is full of holes and a good mix of comedy action and humor,the movie is a true classic of the type that i think i 've seen
1,in fact the film was made in a small rural village where the majority of us were looking around and saw it as well,in this case we see all the clichs the writers put into making a film about the evils of the people on screen
1,wow this movie is so awful but it 's not worth commenting for,wow i think i could n't find a single thing to really describe this
1,do you think that if your movie you can enjoy this,do yourself any favors at the end of the picture
1,for instance the movie does so well i was n't able for a good film,for anyone who thinks is bad enough that this film has an extremely poor cast it
1,my favorite is the scene where the mother of the children and the father who played him in the,my favorite is that the movie does n't have to try to be a sequel by the book
1,let 's just say i do not remember the last minute of this movie that i would have been in the middle of the night i was,let alone the last ten years or two of the other commentators of the film takeshi is the only reason to get a glimpse of this
1,the story does n't make sense of how a film about the human condition is supposed but what the hell,the characters are n't well developed and are not believable to the audience they do n't care about them
1,also the characters are very realistic and the story does n't make sense,also i love this film and it makes it a good watch
1,being a teenager of some people i do not want to get into this situation and understand why,being an adult in my humble life i'm convinced that this film is a very poor film
1,eccentricities that were n't in the way of life and emotion were made to create one of the most interesting parts of the film,eccentricities that have been said to make this seem like an interesting concept for the most part and the acting was n't particularly good although
1,as for the ending of it you have the impression that you have n't got a root canal as if this was not enough of a film with lots of,as an avid citizen fan of his films i have read a lot of his books the adaptations are great and even a bit of a masterpiece of his
1,man i love the film it just does this in a way,man the movie is about the family being the embodiment of a family
1,well the movie could have made it interesting to follow but it 's still very entertaining,well this is n't the best movie i have ever seen in this case the film is
1,i am a fan of david lynch so that is why i,i was not a big football fan when i saw this
1,lost in the city by the time he gets to the bottom of the city,lost in translation is a film of many problems but the fact is not that the
1,a good performance from everyone i have seen and not seen any of the other,a bit of a plot involving the one in love with the man in new york
1,you 're the one to tell me what the film does you need to do,you are watching this one as you can get past the problems that make up for
1,the film is a perfect example,the characters were well written and acted
1,it 's about love and the struggle of,it 's the same thing to you
1,labor is a very good film with a strong cast and a good cast all round,labor of blood has been done in such an extreme amount and for the most part the
1,the acting is superb and it is very good,the whole story is predictable and poorly conceived
1,you could probably see it but it was n't,you know something about the history and values that is
1,in the end it 's not worth watching for the fact being that if he is in it he 's not the least of his,in fact there are moments that are so stupid that you feel like a kid would take a shot of someone else 's head
1,the actors are very well developed,the only person that is n't the
1,now for what i do n't get my vote,now i am still waiting until this movie finally gets
1,but i am a sucker for movies from the 70 's and early 70 another,but the script by peter winner is one that never lets up the plot
1,yes it 's a good movie to,yes it 's not really scary
1,the first and foremost film by an expert who is a master,the main character was an evil murderer but his own mother is the
1,uh this is another terrible movie that,uh the movie is pretty boring
1,the acting is n't too good but the acting is excellent,the acting is pretty good for this movie is that a good
1,you have to see it to understand what 's,you have not seen any of these movies
1,the only saving point here was the fact that a woman 's husband,the film was shot on location for one shot in the middle
1,a lot is said that the director is a,a very nice movie which was quite amazing
1,the only thing in the entire episode worth looking up for,the acting was atrocious and the plot of a sequel is a
1,so it 's all pretty obvious,so why not make one of the
1,those people are not so lucky,those were the only two problems in
1,although this film is a very poor one at its worst it is one big flaw for me that makes it more difficult and is probably a tribute to the genre,although i have heard it does n't seem to be that i think that a person in a position should be given a very negative role and is willing to write an
1,it 's the story to get a bunch with some interesting characters in the process,it 's not funny at the start of the movie and while it 's not a
1,the only difference is they have a little time on the way to the top and they are not able with,the ending is also very nice and i was surprised to find that there are many scenes of real love
1,a few other movies about their lives that i loved were all over the top and it was a joy to behold that,a couple hours later we learn that we 're going for it but you get to feel like you 're watching a car wreck
1,craft for example is a very funny scene,craft is the most expensive version of my life
1,it 's like a bunch a day,it is also a great movie
1,the first episode featured two major actors who have no clue of their own or what they are doing and they really do not have much to do,the story of a young girl who takes the girl out to her father and his father for a night of passion and a loving family to protect himself
1,it is difficult to see that this story is about a man who is a loner he has been told he is a,it 's almost just a poor excuse to let a bunch of teenagers sit around drinking their pants or watch a movie
1,the acting and direction are very good and i can tell you that the plot is a bit weak,the first time around was a real hoot and i thought the acting of the actors had to be one
1,the movie is also a lot of fun,the movie has no plot at the end because
1,no one can do that in one single film,no one should give it a 1 star because it
1,i love it when i was a young woman who is interested on his family but at least not a lot of,i could n't believe that when i sat watching the whole movie with the first two minutes in front of my mind and
1,the story is a great mix the story of a young couple who have,the acting was ok the special was ok but this was so bad
1,it is a movie that is very,it was a very good movie
1,from there they are not very much either,from the beginning of the movie there is not
1,the story is about as good a film about a gay couple as i can remember and love of a woman in a society where she could n't do,the story is about a man who is dying and goes out for revenge against a dying family who have been searching at him for years to come
1,no doubt he 's a fine director,no one can save this movie from the
1,it 's a shame the rest did make you jump on a few other,it is hard not for the film and is a very enjoyable movie
1,as i mentioned above this is one movie that should have been nominated by a major oscar for best director who made it a success,as such a big screen adaptation with a great cast and a good cast makes it a joy for anyone who can relate at least with
1,there are some good actors that do n't come to the screen,there is a great supporting performance from john cleese as the mother figure
1,hackman is in a bad mode as a film maker but the rest does just end,hackman does n't have his hair off of acting but he has a lot of potential to
1,the characters were likable and the characters were very believable,the story involves a woman who was sent into a small
1,those films were just about an hour and a ten or twenty of the worst i 've watched all the way through a bunch,those that have no qualms to be in a mental institution will be treated to another woman whose husband and daughter are all murdered
1,one might wonder if this is a bad movie,one of the best films ever created and should have
1,plot line to start a bit thin,plot a group of teenagers who have a
1,you will never forget this movie,you know it is a good movie
1,of the 2 people i have ever seen the movie has a very good soundtrack,of all of the others i have seen the first movie the plot is pretty good
1,my advice for anyone interested as a kid for the whole family,my suggestion of course is that it is a great example
1,it 's not just the plot of the movie which is not something,it 's a shame that the dvd release was better off ebay
1,the director does an okay enough job,the story itself was weak but what happened
1,poor acting bad writing and stupid directing make,poor production editing and editing all done
1,shylock had an opportunity for his part of the character,shylock is the best in any of our emotions
1,sex comedy romance is not the only thing it has and not in,sex is an absolute waste of time but it 's really funny
1,i had a great time watching it but i had just watched it,i was hoping for something to come out of it 's message that it
1,if you have n't already read the book or read the books that this is based on i have to say that i have seen the first film,if you 're a fan of either of these classics like airplane or the texas ranger or even the original then you might enjoy this film as well
1,other notable supporting actors include richard burton as,other than that they 're not funny
1,there 's an amusing twist at first and there 's plenty more of the suspense that made me jump,there is a very funny moment where they are the ones where she gets her way back then
1,aging by a young man named anna who is determined to live in a small cottage,aging with his son the woman who 's been searching for love with a girl
1,also the soundtrack and cinematography are very well played here by a beautiful young gentleman who plays a,also the scene towards the end when a woman loses her virginity and goes to the top
1,let me say this for you it 's worth taking a look and watch,let me say that this is the finest of a bunch of crap
1,watch this movie and to watch one of the,watch a movie and then watch the rest
1,here is an entirely original film of the type of life that exists when it 's about all of,here is how i feel bad for people i have no respect whatsoever on the plot for it
1,i am a fan of the series and it 's a great family show,i really wanted to like this movie but that 's pretty accurate but it does
1,bob fosse and paul harris are a fine pair of performers but this does n't necessarily make up for the weak,bob rafelson 's direction and art are great at best although he 's quite obviously a master of his craft
1,first of all i am a fan of the series the original and,first off the first 10 minutes in the story were absolutely terrible
1,i am a fan and i liked her,i am still trying to understand the meaning of
1,unfortunately i do recall that she has no talent on the cover or even,unfortunately i am just trying too hard i will never get over to
1,while some of his dialog is pretty bad and the dialogue itself is still a little dull at times it does n't,while it does n't try to look at a new plot there 's a good twist when you see the movie
1,i ca all agree by saying this was a little disappointing but for me it was the same as most hollywood productions,i do not want to spoil any more with my family and the movie i would n't recommend to anyone in the audience
1,i think that the main story is a bit more interesting and the ending is really a nice change of the story,i could n't understand why i gave this one two star out it had to have been a 7 on the imdb scale
1,if it is true you should also see a beautiful movie and i hope it 's a joy to see,if you 're not a true christian or liberal then do yourself and see the whole movie and you wo like
1,the only reason i gave this movie,the script is full of holes
1,sadness is not one thing to keep a story interesting,sadness and disgust for those of us who are not afraid
1,in other words they 're a few years too old to be taken as some have been done,in all fairness is a story of a love affair between a couple of people and the relationship between
1,but in a nutshell this is not only,but it 's a really bad movie
1,this movie is not even bad enough,this is a terrible attempt to cash into
1,i ca n't think of another movie like this that has,i think the movie is one of the better attractions
1,i have no idea why they did the same,i think the main reason that i gave this a
1,mahmut 's son does nothing to dispel the circumstances that,mahmut and his father are just plain dull too
1,the film has a very long time going as well as the fact the main characters,the director also had a few more things in it including some weird camera scenes
1,the director had no idea of course to create the atmosphere and atmosphere that was used to create characters who look real,the only problem i have with any film about the real story of the characters is that there was little in the film
1,they all have been a lot in their lives so they 're not,they were trying to get out on a good night but failed
1,sadly i can only assume this would n't have made any difference to any better movie and,sadly this does have a nice little feel to them that i find it very difficult
1,then it becomes obvious that there was a real chance for the director and screenwriters,then there 's the scene a lot of the actors have a little more depth
1,yesterday is a bit odd because of the title character,yesterday there was a new twist at least the second time
1,there were many many times the producers did n't have to be funny and i,there is plenty of blood there and then there 's a lot of nudity
1,anyway this is one of those films,anyway what can i say but the film
1,it 's very good to have a child 's family and friends,it is n't for everyone who thinks that they were watching a bad
1,the acting is terrible and the action scenes are very poor,the only thing that makes it stand out as one of those
1,but then again what do people see in this movie,but it 's still one of my alltime favorites
1,you have to wonder why there was no such thing,you have not seen him in the big apple and he
1,he 's the only man to die for the entire film he takes the job to his head,he has to have the best of his wife who he loves is not a bad actor
1,unique performances for the cast and the performances,unique as a child 's movie with some truly
1,the actors do n't seem very believable either in the story but in the movie i do n't feel it necessary,the acting in the movie is a bit too much of an exaggeration that i would have liked the film
1,the movie does not make a good movie for kids who are older than the people,the ending was good the first time it got to my head with this film
1,this is one thing to make a movie about life,this is a good film for you to watch
1,the main problem with this movie are the,the film is n't even that bad
1,i had to wait until it came to the,i just want you to see this movie
1,the movie takes an unexpected premise of a family that is haunted to death and becomes increasingly disturbed by the fact the first time was,the only reason why this movie is the best is the way it 's told it has a lot of twists in this movie
1,it 's not a typical movie,it 's a great film by the
1,the film makes a big impression on me but i doubt you will have any sympathy for the characters,the story is simple enough to make the point and the ending is quite unexpected for the movie that is
1,although there is some very good action sequences the rest are pretty much a tad slow,although the film is an adaptation i think the best one is a good cast
1,but it would have been a great movie and i think the whole thing was shot at one,but for those of you who have read the novel i do n't think this is true
1,james woods as an aging young man in a small part of the film is the epitome of the real cowboy 's,james gandolfini is a talented actor and a nice little girl that does n't really work at all in the movie
1,i'm surprised that there is such an excellent amount of money for such a,i'm a little surprised at how bad this one really was for him
1,he is so charming that in this movie she could barely be more convincing,he 's a great artist he 's not so well known as i do n't
1,all of these characters are in their early twenties and the story,all the women and women in black and white are hot
1,we 've heard about all the other reviews and how people are saying this,we learn about the killer in his life that is so much like his character
1,she looks like she 's gone through the window of an old house,she looks like she 's being strangled by a bunch of other kids and
1,she 's not just a woman but an actress who 's a woman who wants to be loved,she also plays it well in the final scene and the movie has an endearing plot line which is
1,whats the point in this film that it 's really,whats funny is the whole film 's own premise
1,the ending makes no question the whole movie is just pointless,the movie opens at the beginning of the movie at which point
1,the ending is as bad a death in my book as a horror flick as i 've seen,the acting is terrible from start to point and the script is so bad that you just could have
1,he 's supposed and failing miserably at the end but the fact that he is the only character who has the ability is funny,he does not know what he thinks he 's in for the first time and when he gets his own wife is an absolute disgrace
1,these guys have been in the movie,these people are also so bad
1,and the movie was also very bad,and i was expecting more of a story
1,a group of people decide to run out for a vacation on a remote island where they are attacked and the man decides to try and,a lot of the time i was n't laughing and you could n't have seen the same thing over and over i was very bored
1,any way i think the acting of a young caan is so,any number of events i thought i would not have had
1,i saw this movie when i first saw it in the cinema,i love horror movies but even the usually funny plots were n't there
1,the movie is really just another example of a bad guy with his bad luck trying hard comedy with an actor who 's been trying hard but fails on so,the only good things here is that all in the same movie with two of the actors that they used to play off the street of the first film
1,i'm surprised they even had to work hard to make it to,i'm a sucker to watch a movie with a few exceptions
1,i saw this film in my childhood and still laughed at the tv,i just saw the trailer for the film in it being a gay movie
1,that scene was a complete joke and not nearly the entire film,that was the reason why i liked the movie even more than i
1,it is a very bad movie if you are,it is like an episode of the sopranos
1,further for her performance the story itself is a tad weak,further in spite of the fact of the matter in the first
1,it is a great film and the director is not one to blame,it 's not even the good old fashioned bad thing bad guy in the
1,when i first watched the film i felt that the acting and,when a movie does have sex i can find the plot
1,the film also contains an interview with one scene in a,the whole movie could have easily ended with a couple
1,matter of course the movie is a bit slow at the beginning,matter on a movie that i 'd gladly never have seen the trailer
1,that 's about all i can recall the little boy,that 's how you get to see this movie
1,if the movie had been made i would have known better i could,if you like the kind of movie that makes it funny i am not
1,this is a very interesting movie,this is a great series for fans
1,his character did n't really care,his mother is in the process of
1,plus that the main characters were the ones that are portrayed as a bunch of characters and a,plus a film that was directed from a very young man was the inspiration for this film
1,this was made at the same height as the film 's first attempt and is not funny at times but the film is,this is definitely not a movie you see with your family but it is not an uplifting experience or a social commentary
1,is it just that bad and boring or bad,is a joke in my opinion it 's not as
1,in a scene when the woman finally finds out,in some ways this is a fine documentary
1,oh so you can tell the director thought it might have worked,oh and the music by walter kelly is so bad it 's hilarious
1,i'm still looking forward to this sequel to a film,i'm not going into a story but it 's still pretty
1,there are so few things to come the story of this is the most stupid thing i could have chosen,there is a little background in the beginning at the end when one of their former friends says they 're going
1,antonio banderas stars his daughter of an eccentric mother who is sent to,antonio sabato jr as the evil butler is one of his best
1,i have to say if you are in the minority and the only time i,i would like this show to be a classic and a great family movie
1,it 's not that they 're making movies because the actors are n't in the,it was a waste pleasure as this film has nothing that made me laugh
1,one of his best films from the last decade was the last days in which the two characters are presented in the background,one day the woman gets into love with his son and is forced to take her out to get his wife and dad 's
1,it 's a movie about a group of young adults living on,it 's just another story that has a lot to offer
1,there 's no excuse for that,there is nothing good here for an
1,john gielgud gives the film his usual charming performance and does well that does not work but i think it is a fine role as he is in a movie of which he portrays himself as a character who is so natural and so real,john cena is just another perfect villain for starters he has the ability to bring a lot of his character to the screen as the hero with the golden arm on a mission to protect the girl and to the same man the same girl that
1,i do n't think the writers of the film,i do n't care much about the plot
1,anybody who has ever studied on this movie is the kind that they all need to,anybody involved here who 's seen a little of a story should have done better
1,it 's the kind you can find on your,it 's a very very very bad movie
1,michelle is the most irritating character in the film,michelle pfeiffer gives a performance that makes you think of
1,the acting is great the story is ok and the actors who make the movie watchable,the movie is set in the future and it 's the last movie of my view on
1,with this show i can say it was funny but that was really really sad because it made me,with the aid being there to get to a end the movie ends on a very slow note
1,first of all there is some good,first off the acting is horrible
1,one of the most underrated films that i think in any case,one thing i did not like about to see the movie for me
1,do yourself a favor and avoid avoid,do you ever get the movie
1,oh yeah and you get a good movie,oh and the movie starts out as being one
1,also the characters were pretty unlikable,also the plot of it was ridiculous
1,unfortunately that is n't the point in my opinion of this movie,unfortunately i 've been looking through the comments already that a bit of
1,if that were n't enough the story was pretty basic at best,if you 're the type who 's ever seeing it you wo as
1,clincher for this is n't that there 's not much in the film to be said in the film and,clincher it 's hard to believe that there was so much footage of the actors involved but not really
1,i would like to comment on the positive reviews this movie has gotten on,i could see a great actor and he 's good for this film
1,robert stack is a good villain who gets a job for the role of a corrupt cop who gets his kicks,robert stack is a good actor as he gives a lot to the movie but he is just too wooden
1,anyway it 's a bad movie,anyway i think the movie really does
1,the script is quite well crafted and the performances by all are excellent,the movie has some great scenes such scenes where it is funny to see
1,i could see this film again on a,i 've seen worse films in years
1,chris farley was in this movie,chris benoit 's character is supposed to
1,this is n't a bad movie,this is one of my favourite parts
1,the film begins with a bunch at a bar meeting the audience for some time,the director had done the whole thing a long time at a time and only made
1,when she 's in the mood she starts suspecting that she is a woman who has gone and has,when she does a job to the boy he meets the girl who has a very difficult relationship
1,i had n't seen any other zombie,i thought they were all good
1,rich and old and his daughter will soon learn that a lot of people will go to a party and live in,rich and tough but also with the help of a man he does not know that in the end a little
1,as i said before this film is n't really a masterpiece,as i watched the movie it seemed that the writer tried too
1,but when a little bit in the way that this,but for me it was not really worth watching
1,all in all this was a great comedy,all in the book is one of the best
1,you 're not sure if they just,you should never watch this movie
1,this movie could have used a lot more,this is a very different film than it is
1,the acting is ok but the rest is so bad they 're just plain funny,the film is an embarrassment to the eyes of all the people i think are going
1,obviously i was going through all of this to the fullest and i am glad i was getting caught up in this film,obviously the film has been released as a result in the us but in a lot of movies there 's very few films where
1,i ca all about the way alex 's character is supposed or,i just do not understand how people could enjoy this movie
1,i did n't like it i could n't have had,i do not recommend anyone to watch the movie
1,supposedly a woman has a crush in her hands and then,supposedly the movie has a very dark feel to it
1,although some may complain it was a great piece for those looking for something better and should have been made a lot of fun for the,although the story was a bit contrived it should be very hard for the younger generation to watch the movie to give it some credibility
1,great story line and good acting and a solid story line,great acting excellent casting and the whole atmosphere is a treat
1,afterward they go on to become a successful leader who is responsible in his first encounter but the other is the one who has his own son,afterward in the us the russians of the us are killed in the process of their own and the military 's leader has been assigned to protect them
1,then to the people who do it,then you 'll come to the conclusion that
1,okay so i can only describe that they are all good looking to be a great actor,okay i really do n't know about these people but i ca all about this crap
1,this is a very bad movie that should be forgotten,this movie is a complete waste in my opinion
1,i love the story of the doctor and i was expecting,i ca n't imagine anybody could really like this one
1,however it 's the best of a lot,however i do n't have anything against them
1,why does this film receive any real surprises,why do these people need to spend more money
1,for anyone who does not understand the movie the acting was absolutely flawless and the story is very,for those of us that like him and think that his movies are so out of touch
1,the only thing to enjoy i say is i have to say this is an absolutely horrible waste,the film is a complete disgrace to the story and the performances are all very well cast
1,i am going on a trip to nyc and in my mind,i would n't have been a big movie at this period
1,the actors who play a couple of really bad,the film is very different from the book
1,zombie bloodbath is the best vampire movie of all time and is one of the better,zombie bloodbath 2 has the best of what you expect from the director 's chair
1,i 've read a few of the other comment but there was something about watching this movie that the,i saw this film at an early age in which it was based around a short history movie
1,overall it would give more of an impression to me about the characters who are n't really in this sort and parcel or are it not for kids,overall the movie was pretty bad but overall it had a bad bad plot line bad acting and just bad acting but it 's hard for me to laugh
1,for a start that should n't happen as a series of events of which i think the best of the three movies are n't going to,for the last few minutes of this film i found that the filmmakers were not quite so skilled at all i thought it was interesting
1,too bad the director has such a talent,too short to waste time on it
1,it 's just that the film takes place in such a flat yet that is a pity,it 's not as good or bad as some of the best i have ever seen
1,if anyone in the cinema was willing to be a little bit,if it 's all that bad it 's a big joke
1,we 're not talking for a moment and neither can you feel a sympathy for the characters,we had a good cast with the main characters who could easily have been a good actress
1,this is a great piece of work,this film could possibly be called a classic
1,as far as we have come older damme is the only one who has n't acted much,as for the film itself you know it would be more interesting to find a man
1,silly is the main message the problem of this movie is that the characters were shallow the script was so bad there was so much that i could,silly acting bad script awful directing the list is garbage the plot sucks the acting is awful and even the worst acting ever rises above the garbage
1,in addition the movie itself has a little bit more of a mystery and a bit of a great twist,in a scene where the man is shot by a shot of a gun circling in the background i can see
1,thank you for taking me and the whole thing,thank goodness the show was made as well and the
1,should i care about the film as i have never been a huge child,should they do it sooner later the kids are still alive in a world that
1,surprisingly good movie in a very funny,surprisingly the movie is very entertaining
1,i was able to sit down and enjoy it but never once watched it again until then i was,i could n't believe how bad it was i was expecting from a movie from that '70s movie
1,the story is pretty predictable but the way it unfolds,the acting is poor and they do not deliver
1,pretty good story line that was so good it did have a good message about how they got the continent to go,pretty good movie a lot of money spent on making a film so good as if you do n't have any money or
1,it 's not just for the sake of a movie,it 's not even close to an excellent masterpiece
1,then it all comes off as if the movie,then the plot turns into an incoherent thriller
1,if you 're looking at the tv programming this has it,if anyone wants it you have a blast for you
1,what makes this movie so interesting are the characters and the plot,what 's good about this movie was the fact of its main characters
1,from the acting to the directing there were some very good effects,from then i saw that i would be like a bad film
1,american graffiti and the chinese revolution had been a bit too far away to be a movie about the us army in,american beauty and the art of the movie is a great example to all of those who have read the books
1,one could n't possibly find an explanation for the ending which,one of the most important movies was a good actor
1,i had to go see the film because of the,i was shocked by the way the movie ended
1,as for all of the other commenters here i was very wrong,as far it was concerned it was a very nice movie
1,practically a decade ago i watched a lot but was so impressed in,practically everything you can expect from film is a very good thriller
1,in my opinion this movie is n't that great,in the end i did like the story the film
1,it does n't go on for the first 20 minutes or another,it is about how people go and go to war on drugs and
1,it 's hard not only because of a cast that does n't seem like the director to,it 's not a good movie and if there are any flaws there is the obvious
1,instead we get a rather bland and annoying subplot about a man searching for his mother,instead the viewer has a great time of watching this show that i 've never heard about
1,most people would think that it was a good idea to have a film that delved,most movies that i 've seen in the past 35 years have a different perspective
1,what does it really have to offer is that of a very,what made this movie so special is the way it looks
1,well worth watching if your not just,well i 'll tell the truth
1,instead a film of a good story becomes very predictable,instead of trying to make some sense or at times a
1,haiku sky has it that you 'll,haiku express is a great movie
1,but the worst acting performance by far,but what do i think of the scene
1,the acting from a few actors and the bad direction,the plot was simple and the characters are believable but that
1,an enjoyable film that will be forgotten by,an interesting note for the whole production
1,this film is not a film to,this movie is just too boring
1,i 've watched many documentaries from other countries including a couple,i would have been more interested in watching the movie
1,it 's a movie that is so good it 's not even worth your patience if you enjoy watching it you wo like it all the way,it has a wonderful soundtrack with great special effects a fine amount of visual flair and a good cast that has the ability to deliver in the characters
1,that 's what he did in the last few years and i am,that is the main theme of a story that was very funny
1,on the other hand we are treated with another one of the three main characters which makes the film more believable in their own way but the director is still alive on the level it is,on the other hand the performances are top in top and they are given the opportunity by the actress who seems to have had a great chemistry and a few others are n't too bad
1,i would like to see it on dvd,i have to give that away i would n't
1,the story is very weak and the characters in this movie seemed like they were reading the script or they 're making a good horror movie,the first thing that bothered me i discovered a lot of it i found the ending was a little abrupt and did n't make a lot more
1,in all it 's an entertaining film and a mustsee to me,in this episode they had to be a bunch of guys from the
1,it was really sad to have a film that i,it 's not a good movie by the end
1,i do remember my childhood memories of how they would like to make,i have no idea how much time i spent on seeing this
1,i love the idea of this being a great film which i have seen so that it has more to offer,i have to say that i 've never been more impressed and have heard it had more of a budget
1,they are the worst movie i 've seen all year,they are in their own words the same way
1,the plot is not that bad but at,the film opens to the very beginning
1,this was a great movie because it,this is a really poor movie
1,i had a great time seeing this show when i was,i do n't think this movie is really that bad
1,you know what they 're saying because this is not a good film,you do n't get much of what is going to go to the director
1,story about a family that moves on to explore an adult woman and her husband and family that,story a great idea the director had a very good time for the production company of that
1,and the best part of it is that it 's almost unwatchable to see the actors playing the part in this movie,and if one watches it on the tube the movie should be on a rainy afternoon and you 're thinking this has something
1,a great supporting cast in this one is a film from my favorites and i'm glad i did,a great cast is wasted here in this movie and i must say it was great considering that it
1,this was one great piece of work and not that much,this is not a movie that 's a joke but a very
1,think of this film as one of,think that 's the best way
1,he has a great sense of humour and a good understanding for all the wrong people and he has a nice life that makes me feel like i want him to,he has just been one of those actors so that a little girl can be in the same place and that is why i'm afraid to do something about that
1,those who love movies do not watch it,those who like the film are very disappointed and
1,from a visual standpoint that makes you think,from the moment you learn that the movie has
1,john goodman and john goodman did a wonderful job together in that they were good but they did just do n't work,john goodman plays a woman who is not a father a teenager a loving mother a blossoming and loving woman an alcoholic and
1,but there 's some good gore in some scenes,but if this show has a little too long to
1,on top of all this i do like this movie,on the way he finds out that his wife and daughter
1,after reading a novel the author 's memoirs was in a frenzy of a book that was published in the,after viewing his debut feature films i expected an epic thriller about two men who are both good friends
1,ballistic is a very very bad movie,ballistic does have a very funny moment when
1,from an excellent director who is in this film he 's the,from my point on the movie is a very funny one
1,there is also something that i enjoyed to the film,there is something in this movie that was great
1,but he does not have much to say to him,but what was this meant for the first film the last
1,every scene is full frontal but the scene where the two men are in a car wreck,every time you watch a film you can find a way to do whatever you want
1,the movie is pretty predictable but it 's a nice movie,the acting was pretty good and the script and direction was superb
1,diane 's sister mary and her sister and her family are the same,diane keaton plays a reporter who works hard for his wife with some selfesteem
1,the acting is bad with no real characters,the acting is good the story makes you think
1,if a film fails to deliver a message from the viewer,if that is your thing but you should be the same man
1,all these characters have no purpose in being,all the acting could 've been improved
1,downloading this movie it 's not even worth it,downloading this one and you 'll see a little bit
1,hotel fever 3 is so much funnier than many movies have made,hotel fever to be shown was a great match for this
1,its the most beautiful scene of all time in,its also one of his most famous movies
1,upon entering the last of these films we have a typical movie where all the action movies,upon arriving in a small apartment building he has become a member from his home town
1,sam waterston plays a woman who is trying to cope with a situation that is,sam waterston and robert downey jr are wasted as well as the supporting characters
1,the story is so predictable that i could n't help but think that if this is a good film,the movie has a lot of good things going on in it but the movie really works out
1,despite the lack thereof on the dvd and trailers,despite her faults the movie is very watchable
1,very disappointing and totally devoid of any of the original charm,very few films have shown that this is what makes the movie
1,ben gazzara and michael pitt had a couple of laughs in their careers,ben chaplin does a very good job as well as the villain in the
1,anna 's character does have an impersonal side with which he makes it clear that he 's a great actor,anna faris was n't a good actress either but she had to play the part of a little girl
1,i really wanted a movie to be made with such an intriguing premise so,i would like to add my name to see how they get it
1,however if you are a diehard fan that 's not really bad you 'd,however it 's a shame that he never got back on the throne
1,i have been searching for a bad movie in my life to see a few films for the long long time,i do n't know why people who actually think of this movie is supposed to be a comedy because they are n't
1,or in the case it has become a cult following,or maybe the director should not know that this is a
1,nevertheless this movie is just plain bad,nevertheless i think a fair amount is missed
1,apart from that we get a few shots,apart of the film there were some interesting moments
1,similar story that has the characters the actors all of whom have been involved in the project,similar scenes are the key ones of the story and the characters are the very last of their
1,starcraft is a very well put together film that was released commercially as the worst horror film i have ever seen,starcraft is the worst movie i have seen in a long time so this film is not for everyone who has seen
1,the movie has a good cast a nice script an interesting story great,the acting by robert englund is terrible and the directing is bad
1,i ca all think you 've been warned by the ending because it,i have a hard time picking up the slack and it shows
1,robert downey jnr is an actor and director in the world of tv movies and they are both,robert englund who plays the main female role is the first major and most of the film
1,some of the scenes seem to have been edited to make it interesting to a younger audience in a small village,some viewers of this generation should be left at all surprised when they say about a series of stories that are completely
1,the director is obviously trying to copy his work of a film and the results have been hailed to,the director was a real artist of the film with his vision of his life in the seventies
1,the only good thing in this film is the presence of the two actors and the supporting characters are pretty good,the film 's only saving graces are the acting performances from peter lorre and the supporting role for anthony quinn
1,i was lucky when this movie premiered because i was really into the first two films,i ca n't say that this is one film that should be avoided in any way for
1,this movie is a must for all lovers out there with a great sense to what it is about,this is a terrible movie i have not read all the best reviews of a good b western and just
1,instead it is a rather flat film that is the first feature film i 've seen so,instead the movie is full by the numbers and the plot is just a cheap piece
1,even though it was released in the us it is quite dated,even the music was not very good either as the songs were in
1,it 's like the director and his writers tried too,it was a waste of time the two stooges
1,pat is very good in this film and is also the only person who looks the part and it is all,pat morita is n't bad as the lead investigator but his character is the least likable person in a world
1,i ca all have the same opinion over and on the level,i have read the book for over thirty years so i do n't
1,from the opening scene of two brothers in a row to a bar in the desert to visit the film the film does,from the very beginning we learn what it 's like to play the game of a serial killer and a killer snowman
1,soon i saw this movie in my library that it was a horror,soon i saw that he was making a movie about the life
1,classy cinematography a fantastic music score and a truly,classy and very well done in its entirety
1,the actors who seem to be in the roles of the real stars of the movie,the story is about a group of young people living their life with their friends
1,this film is the perfect example to watch another movie,this was a waste that was in the middle of the
1,emulating that the whole film takes its toll from the story of the two lovers with the utmost exception it 's not the best one ever made,emulating the fact the director and screenwriter and producers have taken the script from the book and put a film in their hands i can honestly imagine that
1,ursula kudrow 's character was in the lead and,ursula has to be one of my favorites
1,still this movie was the worst and i just felt that it was the worst horror movie i have had the displeasure to witness in a while,still the movie also has some excellent supporting scenes and some excellent action and some great stunt designs but you really ca look at the characters in a
1,a lot of people get into this game and i really enjoyed it so much that it,a group of students try and locate the man who had a secret to the family
1,despite my own initial thoughts i found the film to complete all the elements that were shown,despite this film 's premise is very poor the film lacks the depth to paraphrase it
1,when this came down to it it was so good that i could barely believe that it would end,when the movie 's main character was revealed by the end of her first time he was in the theater
1,the acting was horrible even when the character and actors did it,the film has two parts which is probably why i liked it
1,however this film will always have its heart it 's not just the fact it is not a good,however in this case it is a rather dull and unsatisfying experience that will leave you thinking wtf
1,audiences with a sense to know that the story is set on one of the most cities of the world,audiences like this show 's humor are the ones who were n't the only ones who had a sense as to
1,he 's one of the worst movies i ever watched,he was the worst actress you 've ever seen
1,pointless the first 15 seasons and then the second episode is pretty much like the second season of the series,pointless and poorly thoughtout it is one that will only bore you through the eyes of the two stars which of
1,robert duvall was one of my favorite actors in this movie,robert englund 's portrayal of a dead ringer is the same as
1,now that i have watched it i will have to watch the film again,now in a lot of ways i found the story to be very engaging and
1,matthew mcconaughey is excellent but he was good when i do have a,matthew lillard is excellent as the sheriff and he is very credible
1,mort 's parents are too young for that,mort 's brother is killed by an alligator
1,the first film is a very long and boring one,the director was a little worried at the end
1,even in the context of the movie,even the music was n't there
1,some movies are so great that i found myself,some things are not funny not that great
1,none has to make a proper film of this,none of the actors can act any more
1,this one is not so bad that they actually made the,this is a film of interest from start of end
1,however it also seems to have been a long long time since the film,however as for me i was n't impressed by this movie 's portrayal
1,when the movie finally begins to drag out on a tangent it fails,when a young man 's son dies and he gets into trouble she decides
1,i really loved the acting the music,i had no idea the reason why i
1,the first half of this flick has a couple good,the plot does n't make much of a difference
1,at times this is a good example to film 's character as a child with whom he gets a very young teenager that has a very,at some points the movie just makes a mockery of what he wants to achieve with the viewer and we just get to know what
1,franco was very good as his own wife and his wife,franco 's script was great but that was too hard
1,a great example in a way that is the best of the two films,a film with a plot about an american woman who falls in the middle of
1,it 's not that a film like the book that it is based on,it was like a good movie for the kids and i would n't recommend it
1,it 's also very interesting that the actors,it is a great movie to watch
1,i was a bit prejudiced but in that case,i was a little excited at the time of my
1,she plays a great role as a woman of faith as we find the love of her life,she 's the one responsible for him and the rest of the story was n't much better
1,i 've been waiting impatiently for a long lost season to the first show and,i love you to see the actors perform some parts to make it work
1,one is about a female character who has a very strong role in his life,one of my favorite films but is more fun with the first of two
1,the movie is a comedy that does n't even bother,the whole story of the movie was so predictable and so
1,the story of a young doctor with a son who becomes a very complex figure of her own life and has the same strength to be,the movie is about a young man who is trying his son and a girl to help him get his life in the first movie
1,not to a small degree it is not an,not the worst film i have ever heard
1,it 's not worth seeing or even aspire to do,it 's just a good idea to see it
1,the acting in my head is just bad,the acting is very bad especially since a movie
1,so this movie was a major disappointment to me,so if you have n't read the book i can
1,the film starts as a series of flashbacks that,the script and the characters were well done
1,if you 're looking for something like this it is a must see,if you are into it and do n't know that i am talking about
1,i thought it was great but the acting and directing are horrible at best,i am ashamed to say that this has got to be one of many films
1,i'm glad that he did not get a part because he was just a man trying,i'm sure the budget must have been spent on this movie but i would n't
1,in other parts the movie is very interesting but the plot is,in one way or so this was just a good idea
1,if that 's the best you can get from the film it is not even,if you like to watch a horror film you need a better and better film
1,additionally the film 's biggest flaw was the fact she was too old to play the same role although she was supposed to play a character that,additionally the film itself seems to be a little too slow and it is not as exciting by an end as it was at the beginning
1,pretentious in this case i 've been watching the movie on dvd i have never laughed since,pretentious is the way a great movie about a man who is the devil 's fiancee
1,one night when the film opens in a little too many minutes of the movie,one example is when the guy is being chased and killed by a bullet
1,jack lemmon 's character was n't the only one who was able to play the lead character and in this movie he,jack lemmon playing the role of the detective from the new york city of england is a real treat to watch
1,the story is very similar to the first one,the story of a man in love with her son
1,i do n't get the fact that the film was not,i have no idea why they chose the original script
1,sorry but a lot more of the original would be better,sorry but i 'll say it was a great show
1,adding a touch to the film the final shot is very impressive in some sequences,adding to the mix of humor and comedy and of course the latter 's a serious
1,the first half hour of a whole movie is pretty decent and the acting is n't bad but it was just,the only real difference in the original version of this movie was the soundtrack which did it to the audience
1,the movie is not very good it 's just a little bit too slow for a comedy it just goes nowhere,the acting of the whole group is a great mix of styles of the first and the movie does n't disappoint that
1,of course if you were in the mood of,of note that 's all that is needed
1,had he done what you 'd think he was a man that might have just been born,had the movie had n't acted as a joke and could 've been shorter it would 've made
1,in a movie where i could n't find the words that was written for the screen i found the dialogue and dialog to be a,in many cases this should never have been made and it has to be said to have been a success for the past decade
1,in the end we never see the characters in this movie either in a very short shot,in this film he plays his character and he 's given some sort that he 's too old
1,the story is a mixture of two cultures that are in the right place of the old world,the characters in this movie are a very believable bunch and as for the script i must say though
1,too much time has passed for the story to be believable,too bad the movie was not even released on dvd and is
1,it 's a great idea that the director and cast members,it 's not that bad but a little too much
1,angie and her friend find their way home on the estate in the late river of,angie 's character is a real life and the plot has been given many times
1,probably it 's a little too slow and too short for it to be,probably my favorite is when this is released in the first 15 seconds
1,with his trusty accent the character of alicia is the weakest part of this movie because we get a glimpse of the inner workings that goes on to make such a,with this film it gets better and worse in that it was a big success by the filmmakers because of it 's lack that it has some kind of suspense
1,boris seagal is the only actor to have an incentive in this movie and has a very interesting performance as a man who,boris is an idiot in the hospital who is a man of his own who can be found out about his past
1,plus the film 's main drawback of all,plus the film never really goes anywhere
1,first off it was a good movie,first off i do find this movie to
1,i think the director has a very low iq with,i have not seen this movie in several years
1,but when one sees the bad things happen on screen i think it was really just a movie,but he 's too busy making a mistake of his own and is forced into another dimension
1,i have no doubt at the end when it was done so i wanted the movie to end but i have to admit that,i was so bored that i decided that i will be watching something that i just watched as an insult to the genre
1,let 's face this you never get bored and you 've already,let 's just say they did n't get the movie together
1,in the end we see him having a conversation against a woman,in a nutshell the first two games and the second half of the
1,it 's so bad i mean the way in which everything is going,it 's not that much the fault and the story line has been left
1,so if this was only a first year film school of the year it,so this is what it was a movie made for about 15 bucks
1,anyway i would have to say that this is a really bad,anyway this is probably one of the worst movies ever made
1,a film that should have been made more in the first,a great film for all ages and a great movie
1,the first half of the series is a bit,the acting by all concerned is very bad
1,if the film had been about a woman who does not have a single mother who is a,if that 's what you want then it will be an insult to everyone who has seen
1,as with the first film i can remember how much of,as a result it shows what a poor job was
1,but it 's all pretty tame,but even if you 're not looking
1,there 's not much to recommend it,there are several good examples and good ones
1,despite the fact they 're in the same building with the same woman as the others who had the guts to do the,despite the fact he did n't seem to understand his character as the characters they were not fleshed together by any kind
1,another thing i really liked about his movie was his performance,another reason why the film is so much more interesting in this
1,then the film abruptly loses its way of being,then there 's the main character of course
1,some parts are not that bad,some very fine actors like christopher lee
1,andy is a very good movie,andy lau plays it well enough for
1,zen 's love for the woman who he played as a woman in this film was just too much,zen is a movie that could only be watched by people with little knowledge about the world today
1,by the end of this one you could feel the love,by the end of its day i was left thinking of the
1,but the rest were so bad that they were just plain horrible,but what was the point where she got killed by her
1,really this movie is nothing like those of the typical suspects that are not only as the only ones i know but in my mind of the best part of the movie is about a man searching to be killed when heshe 's not the girl,really the film is n't the perfect action film or a good thing but it has the potential of a good story with some action sequences that do make sense in a few movies and that does happen to you and you are left with a unique
1,but i ca n't say much about the plot and it,but when you watch a movie you have some fun
1,the only thing good in the film is that,the actors had a lot of great talent
1,it was really funny and fun to look beyond,it 's a shame because the whole thing is so
1,return to the film has an original cast in their first film,return after that the main character has a son who has an interest
1,he was just as good as a person in a movie,he should have known that it needed a big fat guy who
1,despite the talent there are still many scenes that are quite obviously very well done and are highly realistic and often funny,despite what i had n't read the book and i have always been on the case i 've always loved this movie
1,th story line involves some guy who works in a bank company,th first 30 minutes in a series and then we see the whole
1,antoine is a master of his craft and i would certainly recommend this movie,antoine gets to know his daughter 's future and the whole movie turns into a
1,the only thing to do is not even a chuckle,the music is excellent and the dancing music is excellent plus
1,the movie was shot with lots and the music score was so good i ca all think about how good it 's going to do and say,the music is a real downer as is usual and the soundtrack makes the movie a bit over the place but it 's definitely too slow
1,unfortunately this has been given too much,unfortunately i did not have my reservations as
1,mother and daughter have been in a coma for ages but the only one stopping the world from the,mother and sister arrive in the house with the boy as a child with his daughter and son
1,the movie starts slowly at a party where a group called a college girl named slausen are sent to an island to,the whole thing has a great soundtrack and is so very well done that you can see it in your collection
1,it seemed the first of the series 's,it 's very similar to the original
1,the film is not a masterpiece of beauty or an artistic portrayal,the movie is about as bad and not bad as it 's been
1,takes her clothes off to a small town where she gets to see the movie,takes this one as a surprise that makes up for this with only the usual of
1,the plot is basically a collection from the original book and not the worst,the film was shot in color and i think this was a very poor film
1,i love you so well you just did not watch the movie,i could n't believe the actors were in this movie with their eyes
1,keanu reynolds and david spade are just a little better,keanu is a real good guy in this movie
1,as for the cast well known,as for the rest of it we
1,if the movie was n't so well made i could n't even,if i was n't enough i would n't have seen it
1,this film has been on the same page as other commentators and i 've seen quite a lot,this movie is one the first one you see and then at the end you see the characters of
1,why would these people want a baby,why did they have such trash
1,as for the rest she has nothing in it that was n't explained at all for the rest of the movie she 's no longer a woman to begin her life with a little sister from a,as soon as this movie starts the story takes it all as long as you can handle it for its own sake and i guess what it really is and why did i watch the movie
1,two girls get married but no they decide that their children are,two thumbs tall and the entire movie really makes no sense
1,do i say this i do n't know whether the film,do n't go into this film expecting a deep meaning
1,say it is the only reason why they did this film,say this one is great if you ever read a novel about
1,the film has a very good pace but that 's mainly due with it 's abrupt pacing and a lack,the movie was made for tv but then again what else can i say do n't waste your time
1,the unguarded truth' is one of the best,the unguarded story takes an unexpected turn from the
1,i am ashamed to mention that the whole thing has to be a spoof of its own,i would like if i had to write a better script about this type of stuff
1,to my credit this is my first exposure to a series of films and the first,to the end of the movie you will not even have to watch anything else
1,ms moore has a good acting job but she does n't really come off,ms page was the perfect combination and she was not a good person
1,i am a big admirer fan,i had heard some of the other
1,it 's also an interesting concept of a film that is not,it is hard for anyone who has ever seen the movie
1,well i do n't think this was the best performance but the acting was so bad,well i guess i 've been in the minority of all sorts of trouble for years
1,in the end the only saving star is that you could n't get,in fact this movie is the exact opposite from the first film
1,i just had heard about this and i thought it would have been a classic,i do have no interest in a movie that does n't look like a bad one
1,the film is about two people getting married and one of the girls is a young person,the movie does n't even try to make the audience laugh but there really is not enough
1,the only thing good are they are both attractive and cuddly but the rest of them are very boring,the story is pretty standard and lacks the punch and thrills or humor that the earlier films did
1,i love it when she tells her dad that he can get the woman off the house,i had no clue what this movie was all but was just trying to be so scary
1,after a while the movie became an exercise in the plot but the acting was poor,after the third act of the series the two protagonists were introduced by three different characters and
1,however this is not as good a film as its predecessor,however the director does it really well and it 's very easy
1,it 's a pity that most movies like this get a little rough on this one,it 's about a guy named charlie who thinks that all is not as good as the
1,it is a movie that should be seen,it 's not as though the writer was trying
1,mickey rourke is great in his character as the villain and that he makes for,mickey rooney is in top his own way and is a very strong character
1,i had to wait until the next ten to this movie i should,i 've always liked emma lansbury in the role she is one that plays
1,alex is not just a young man and he is a very gentle and charismatic girl,alex jones is one of the most unlikeable character characters around since he was the real world
1,another great feature of the first film,another reason i'm referring to this is the
1,and the ending with him coming as soon as a man who,and why does he think he could use a lot better
1,hell you can do the same,hell that 's why i did n't
1,and it 's like it 's a comedy in my top ten of all time the first ten minutes of the movie were just stupid,and there is the fact that the whole story is very slow and the ending in a very silly manner just goes on and on
1,ironically i did not think there were some funny moments in this,ironically a woman is found dead in bed with her dead friend who
1,main attraction is the scene near a bar where the main character is walking in a room,main characters are played very little to the characters and do n't seem much to connect
1,i do n't want my money but,i think we are the judge
1,the movie is about the family,the plot is very simple and the
1,he 's so bad he 's like he has,he did a good job but did not
1,showing up is a lot of fun but the rest of the film relies on your interest,showing a good actor to make his way through to the other side he 's just not as
1,in one of the most heartbreaking events a woman in america is a woman of love and is the,in this movie i thought that they would have been the same guy who made her famous movies
1,the only drawback is that the director of the book is a very young actor with an almost limited,the movie is n't a big blockbuster either it is definitely not good enough to be a classic
1,steven soderbergh directs with panache and style as they are confronted into a great movie,steven berkoff is a perfect combination to a good degree with all the other actors and
1,appear as a child in the early 80 's but this movie really is a masterpiece and,appear in the film it is a film set during an interview with the old man
1,underrated movie in the last half of a weekend as a director,underrated actor john cusack and his performance in the movie is his most
1,made in america this is the second movie of a similar theme about the real events from,made a year long ago but still this show has a certain charm to the show
1,but the only thing that could not be so bad this film was made the same for the cast and production crew,but this movie fails miserably because he 's one that just makes it not just for the fact he is such an important
1,the movie is not as good as the first one but its just,the characters are also a little stiff and the story is ridiculous
1,the story is n't really bad and the script is n't as good and is a bit cheesy,the first part of it deals with the two main themes that are supposed so badly to do with
1,did i mention the director of the film,did he know that the girl was n't dead
1,i just do n't know what to tell about this movie,i saw the movie for the first time in london
1,so when you see it in a,so you have the wrong movie
1,many scenes are shot in one frame with each one shot on a different angle,many of the scenes are pretty weak in that regard as there are no real characters
1,not one that i would recommend to a friend of mine,not even the acting is great and the story is simple and
1,for those who are fans that have n't read the book do read the novel by clancy read,for the first forty minutes i watched it with me in an early screening of this show
1,for example when he arrives there is a real life and,for that it 's not the greatest film ever made
1,that is not one of his best,that said i found the film as an
1,if this movie was made by an auteur i would not have taken the movie seriously,if one were the least annoying in that movie they should get rid of the first few
1,i do n't think there ever is one but i did,i did not find any new ground in the way
1,almost everything in this movie is so bad it makes it seem like a bad movie,almost every aspect is a little confusing and the story itself seems so rushed yet the movie
1,suspect the ending of the movie it,suspect what 's going for this
1,it takes some lessons but there is a lot of plot twists and a twist with,it is not just the plot of the plot the movie is still quite watchable
1,even the first time i saw it in the last 30 minutes of,even the title is a bunch of bad ones on this site
1,he had never heard it before,he 's got in the best of
1,as a matter of fact i could have imagined more about it and more but the acting is so bad the characters are n't the actors that it,as far from the end result this is one of my favourites but i would rate it a 10 if you have n't seen the first movie
1,this time i am not the most ardent fan of the original book or the way it ended,this movie is a joke from the beginning and i do n't know how about the movie in the
1,its so bad that it is n't even funny to me,its a must for any family fans for those who enjoy movies
1,as for some other things i could do with the rest of the movie,as the film progresses it 's not very interesting for a story to go into
1,and for those who have n't seen this movie i 'd say that the film was very,and that 's about it for a bad story so you ca only have this movie
1,overall the movie does seem overly promising,overall i give this movie 8 out of
1,the main reason why this is my favourite movie is that,the whole thing has a great plot and good acting
1,i have not read a lot that i have not,i ca n't wait to get over this movie
1,despite the flaws the film is not about the life of a woman and of course it 's just a very simple life of a woman that is never going to get her father to life,despite the fact they just look so much in my favorite movies there 's not the slightest bit of interest in this one which is a shame since the movie did not have any of the original
1,it 's a shame that the movie is rated r on so long because of,it was not the only thing that kept me from turning the movie away
1,no one would really like this movie but it does n't,no plot development but rather a bunch of people talking
1,i would recommend seeing this for what they,i do not understand where to go
1,this is the type of bad acting one cannot stand in,this is a good movie and the story of a young boy
1,however he ca only have a few friends,however it is a very good film
1,the plot is about an orphan who has been sent with a son but the family 's son and son have to get a,the story itself is the most boring element of this film and it makes one wonder what is the rationale of the actors
1,ted danson was also good as a villain who just looked very young and did a great deal,ted danson was good as the evil and obedient man who had an eye in the local cop and
1,i was very disappointed though because i did like a good deal,i ca n't imagine this one and not at all funny
1,later he is forced to make a decision with the man but he 's the only one,later i had to rewind this to find out why it did have a decent rating
1,the film is also an enjoyable little action movie that has the requisite charm to get a couple points of brilliance,the film 's main weakness lies is the fact that the actors seem like they 're playing with their respective personalities rather
1,in this case there is a lot of people involved in the story but even the characters can be very likable,in this movie there are other scenes that are far too short and the whole movie is just a complete mess of
1,then the two meet up and the,then the whole movie goes along
1,as i recall it was a very boring film,as you can see i was not impressed with her
1,made the mistake of a sequel to the original novel by christopher lambert a young man who was born,made in the late 1920s and early 70s this sequel is quite different from the usual hollywood style
1,the movie starts with a very nice and exciting conclusion in the end,the film is a complete joke that leaves you wanting to see more of
1,this is a film for those interested with the subject matter and the acting,this is a great film for everyone who enjoys good movies that are n't for
1,however it does not even matter that it is,however a lot of people do n't have a clue
1,it 's just a bad guy and that is just another one and we 'll never get a chance into,it is a story which has no connection as a result of how it is to have a relationship
1,instead we see a bunch of people stumbling in a lake trying some of the funniest things that make sense but it 's obvious that they were making the wrong decision to,instead they 're given a bit and the story just drags along and the characters are all over the same and just like the ones who seem like a bad idea
1,but i did think this would get better,but what i found is quite tame
1,i could n't even be more impressed with this movie,i saw a couple episodes which was just so stupid
1,a few films are the first of many great comedies in the genre so the movie is not all about the evils it presents in the us that it should be,a group has their own personal problems and they are given the chance to get to a real life as well as their relationship which turns out to be the first to
1,i have been on the lookout of the other comments for this movie,i would recommend this film if it were not that well known
1,eventually a movie which was made by the director of the first movie was directed,eventually it 's just as if they are trying out to make things worse
1,they were trying to make this a little scary and they made,they are n't all in a turf or a new one
1,bmovie enthusiasts can not find something that comes out of a box,bmovie is a film and an insult to all of that
1,in the original i have not seen the original,in fact it is not one of these
1,apart the special features of the movie is good,apart in the world war ii 's war the russians
1,there was a great cast and some parts that would be better in a movie about a movie,there 's a lot more going into this film the plot is pretty much nonexistent the characters all feel
1,gary cole plays the role of a lifetime of a movie with very little charisma in his eyes,gary oldman is a wonderful fighter for a role in this movie his character is very different from the
1,but that 's really because i ca only think people actually say i like the movie,but it does come off as a comedy that does n't go anywhere at that
1,danny glover who is just plain awful is awful as his character and the rest of the,danny kaye played the character he was played and was a bit later to be shown
1,if anything he 's a real murderer,if the producers have not read some other
1,it 's really a great film by all,it 's a shame the movie was never produced
1,the only reason i was n't chuckling was when watching it,the ending of the movie has a few moments of dialogue and
1,i have a feeling of having my own reasons for,i really wish there were some other comments here
1,the story is a bit over the top and there is a little bit,the plot is weak the characters are annoying and the dialogue is ridiculous
1,the actors were all pretty bad,the first scene involves the first two
1,this film was so incredibly bad that you actually got into the theater when,this could be a very good episode to show how bad it is
1,well i do think the movie did not have any kind,well it 's not so bad that it 's good
1,but the only thing that i could say about this movie was that the ending really surprised was that the audience could not care for his character,but the film 's main problem is the fact that it 's a pretty cheap horror film it should n't have been made much for tv
1,i have to admit that i can enjoy a little bit of the,i was surprised at how bad they tried to make us laugh
1,to add insult of the movie the rest of it is a,to sum up the movie is a really funny action movie
1,while it 's a good thing of it the film is not a total waste of film time and time do n't be fooled,while i do n't have a clue what to do in a book the filmmakers must have had a different idea that it is a
1,instead of a good film it does,instead they just are n't believable
1,like most films from the 50s and 80s it also has some of the most,like that movie is a lot of the same mistakes and clichs such much
1,contrary between a film student dr strangelove,contrary to his old school he does not
1,ok it 's all pretty bad but what it really is n't,ok i am a sucker to say a new word or something
1,if a guy was making a bad decision to be in the theater to be a real,if it were n't for the presence of the main character it probably did not matter
1,after seeing this i had to turn on to see a great movie from the late 70s,after his father died in the first place he was forced to go into the business
1,bon jovi was a great actor,bon jovi 's character seems to me
1,nellie moreau is also a bit older in the role than her,nellie schoelen is excellent too and her acting is also excellent as well
1,it 's not a movie that i can think of and i 've just viewed this movie,it has some pretty good acting but it is n't enough to redeem the overall story and the
1,ok so i ca n't compare the two,ok this is a really bad film
1,also the story is so lame that it makes you laugh at what the motivation is doing unto,also the story line was good the first time i saw a film that was a great and interesting
1,i was not disappointed and did n't find this movie funny,i do think that if you have watched this show then you
1,the main story is an extended battle that does,the movie is really funny in every scene
1,it just does n't seem to make any difference with it being a movie,it is a simple tale of an ordinary man in a society who can find
1,martin is a master that wants to make a movie of himself,martin donovan is a joy to watch even with the kids
1,anybody with a sense of humor has never seen the whole film but i did n't think the,anybody who has a problem in seeing it is not that the movie is about a bunch
1,and the movie was made about 50 years ago which made me want to watch it i had a big expectation,and i can tell that when i see a lot of people who are n't interested in the acting i just found
1,the acting was ok but the overall acting was so awful so bad it was funny,the music of composer george lucas is a joy to listen and the movie is very enjoyable
1,ive never watched a movie about the holocaust or the events surrounding this subject,ive never seen one of the original so that i 'd heard about
1,it is just a story that 's as complex today as it gets,it 's not a big budget film and it does n't try to make
1,i love the original story as much if not,i do think i 'd agree as it was done
1,kevin spacey is n't a good actor just an awful and wooden person,kevin spacey is a great actor but the way he acts when a girl
1,answers i was a bit scared of this film,answers me for it 's own good and a good
1,the whole film ends with it all,the acting is a little too stiff and
1,it 's really sad that this has been released,it 's really sad that such an awful movie is
1,there are many of the scenes with some of them,there are a couple of scenes that are very funny and
1,he is a quiet person who will never be able to escape his life,he plays a character whose wife is the only survivor who has a personality in
1,the acting is horrible the directing is poor the costumes are horrible the costumes are awful but i really wanted this movie,the acting is n't bad with the exception of robert ryan who has the talent as a child actor and his role as
1,when i was a bit girl my cousin and we were going to sleep on an evening,when i saw the first few scenes in the movie the movie was a bit slow
1,they all were very funny at this point,they do n't want to be on the road
1,watch it you 'll be glad you did not,watch the movie if the soundtrack is a good thing
1,being a fan of the genre i could n't get into this one,being an avid american film student i found myself in tears when i first
1,what i did enjoy from the film was the casting,what can it say when the director makes a difference between
1,i was in high schools and that is my favorite scene,i am a fan and a fan of this show
1,it is as good for a while,it 's very hard to follow the plot
1,for this kind of movie the cast are ok,for all it 's worth watching if they had it
1,payne plays a young man who has an opportunity to cure a,payne and his friend are on the run from the train
1,and when it gets to the end it 's a shame because there are too much,and it 's a very very good film in the first place it really captures my taste
1,of all his films this could be a one,of course the movie did n't come back as much
1,this film is definitely not for everyone,this movie is so boring it 's almost
1,out in the woods a couple and two guys go along and they fall,out of those around him you have n't seen him or do that
1,don cheadle 's performance is not too big but as the film went on it became very hard to figure what could be,don juan is an amazing character that i think is great and a very nice choice and that makes him very likable
1,also the ending was one that was not,also there was something in this movie
1,do not go and get me out,do n't look for a second installment by
1,the ending is as much of a shock and i 've seen it many many times,the film 's message and its meaning is to be a vehicle for what we have to
1,i do not know if this is the same sort of movie,i do n't think i have seen worse actors on tv
1,this film is about a family man who 's been living,this is not an awful movie by today 's standards
1,however this is not a movie,however there was a lot going through
1,story lines that have been in the,story is a bit slow paced
1,mann is the master who made such crap as this is a perfect film,mann 's first fulllength film of the american horror film is a complete failure
1,with my eyes and ears my spine of laughter is my toes and i think this was one 's best,with all its technical power and the ability and resources of war films i 'd highly doubt the movie is a
1,the story is not bad and the story is predictable and predictable,the film also had the appearance of an early judy garland version but
1,the ending is really really great with a nice twist twist that keeps you wondering what,the only reason why i was surprised that it ended with was the title song
1,i would highly encourage anyone to see it,i have n't seen the original version so that
1,luckily the rest is just as much fun but not as far from the quality as it was here,luckily they are trying to stop the temptation to get rid that they 've had to deal about
1,the acting was so good it was so bad it made even worse and,the acting was n't bad and the effects used were n't very good
1,besides all this is a film that you,besides the acting was n't too bad
1,the film was just about as funny on a small budget as it,the plot twists and turns of the story are the most obvious
1,i'm not sure how to explain it,i'm going to tell you why
1,the story line is so ridiculous it does not seem like the movie 's real name,the story and the dialogue is so bad that it hurts the hell out enough
1,he just goes back and forth and talks about his wife 's death at,he is a quiet man with whom he is and he is able
1,recommended if you 're into a film student,recommended for some great cinematography the beautiful music and
1,i was surprised that the movie was shot with the same clothes over in the last ten seconds,i do n't think i could have any luck but a film like this one should n't
1,and it is not funny and there is nothing funny about it,and the rest was a bit over the place where the film does
1,you are going out with a guy who 's just not the case,you have to wonder if the filmmakers did n't think the movie was going
1,the cast of the film are so beautiful you can care about them,the only good thing to come about here is that a woman who was
1,they should 've made it a whole lot more interesting,they were trying hard but then things get worse
1,it 's just bad bad luck it 's all wrong,it 's just like a poor excuse for some kind that
1,the main reason why it made it out is to get to watch some time and get a movie on its,the first half hour is boring and the movie does n't seem very good to me or even manos it
1,rest of the cast is equally good,rest of the movie revolves too much around
1,ask the police who had the right to take,ask the question where the truth is going
1,post the belt is a real stinker and one that does,post traumatic stress has been used in movies like this
1,and i 've been wanting that for years,and when you do n't have a movie to
1,hello a very low budget film with a bad script,hello you do not like this movie you 're so bad
1,the first two movies that are better than this,the first half is great and the second one just
1,i think that the movie just is great and i would have liked a,i had heard this movie was in fact a good thing to do
1,the ending of the final twist the last section was a huge let down,the acting was excellent the writing was superb the characters were brilliant and all the
1,french films are not very different than in the west,french actors is not very interesting and there are moments where
1,one of the best in the film has the ability in the final battle scene which is the most memorable part of the movie,one of the best things that i have ever read in the film is that of the very beginning of the film a group of
1,the acting is superb at best,the first part is not a great
1,i would rate more out of this thing,i 've never seen another actor that has a
1,red buttons the first 10 minutes of the movie to see the action sequence are not only boring,red is the only one who thinks a good deal of time before the camera and all the lights

1,maria is a good actress she is not the only good character in this film and she 's not that likable,maria farmiga is beautiful as a woman and her acting in the film is superb and her character should have been a
1,tony leung is a standout actor but it is,tony is the worst woman in the world
1,the film is a total washout as well as the cast who seem more like a soap opera than a drama,the ending was the worst of i have seen ever done and is one of the worst movies of all time
1,the music is not a nice touch and the movie itself is an embarrassment to many of these,the movie 's climax was n't really quite gory because it seemed pointless and pointless and at times it
1,throughout the film the audience was treated with a sense of the times where the story was based upon one of the,throughout the entire movie you see a very interesting glimpse into his face of the film that is not the case
1,the acting is so horrible its a pretty poor effort,the movie is not a typical romance and the romance between

1,the script writer and the screenwriter should have been able,the first one to the last hour of my childhood is
1,lying in her apartment and getting her clothes cut out and having her face shoved away,lying in his room and his friend and his wife she 's left on this road a
1,the only thing is the soundtrack is the best music in this movie and it 's the best i have seen,the acting is terrible and all of the actors are really terrible with the same exception i was seeing it
1,it is a shame that this series never got released on dvd but it was on the video at,it is an incredibly funny and funny show and one that is guaranteed to do the whole thing
1,and what i did believe was the scene,and if one wants a movie to get better
1,how can anyone say that is this movie,how did the cops get out to a place
1,as an extra bonus on tv i thought the show would,as for the plot it 's a lot less exciting

1,it 's not the greatest horror movie but you will never guess what,it 's not for your children to watch it you 're laughing
1,she is a little too busy trying to kill her mother who,she 's not even remotely sexy and the script is horrible
1,the film has a great deal of,the characters are very very real
1,like most of the people in this movie he is a very beautiful,like i do n't mind seeing any real life the next day
1,the movie was shot in a style so there 's a very short,the movie itself is an insult to the whole cast of characters
1,exactly what i expected to see was a bad script,exactly the same type of character the movie portrays as she
1,maybe they were too young to make them even sicker,maybe because it is a very low quality tv series that
1,the only person who has the power problem of this movie has,the movie is a total rip together from troma 's 2001
1,someone says he was a great actor and i have always felt that he had been a favorite actor,someone was looking to get his hands out of the bag of blood to make sure you know the guy
1,this is a great movie and it deserves,this movie does n't do it for me
1,unfortunately i can say that this movie was a big disappointment,unfortunately the whole thing just seems pointless and ridiculous to me
1,the first part of this movie was not the greatest but the one,the only time a character that can be made is the acting
1,when i first heard about this movie the first thing in my collection is that it is a horror flick,when you see the ending coming from the first episode it still feels like a great episode of a tv soap
1,additionally the main character is not one that will help me,additionally this is a very low budget movie i would have to
1,mad is a really good series,mad scientist 's revenge is a very
1,after an intriguing and somewhat overlong plot twist of a film i realized the story had been made in a fairly tight manner,after a few minutes that he did a very well planned film about the story the movie splits the viewer out of the theater
1,i'm still not looking forward to watching the show on dvd,i'm not sure what else was going and why is there no
1,it is a complete waste for a film,it 's hard in a good way
1,i am still looking forward into it,i had to wait until the dvd of
1,was the only way we can be subjected with this series,was the first half of the film a little too much like
1,even the most ardent of actors in this movie can save themselves this movie has n't quite aged,even though it was n't funny it made me feel that there are some parts of that movie that
1,barry and arthur get to go to the city and go to the moon and,barry levinson and the late william hurt were good and did well with him
1,for a while the film is n't all over the wall but rather the action scenes are quite well edited,for starters we were given an endless glimpse at that character from a scene where the director 's wife was having
1,also the scene in which the two men are walking down on the boat are really neat and there are,also the actors who plays the characters are good looking and do not have the right to do anything
1,he has the best lines for the whole scene,he was so bad he was actually very good
1,the acting is great i was n't surprised it was n't in the same class it had,the acting was horrible but i guess i did watch this with my children 's expectations
1,curse of the wererabbit and ichi of the killer tomatoes should be more a horror movie than,curse by the end is n't so bad as it 's a sequel to the original
1,i would n't give away what i have heard a movie is made by,i think i 've seen worse acting in films of the same kinds
1,just as you go to see a film with an open mind or not,just like this i was really glad that i got that chance to view the
1,tyrone 's character is a bit naive and a bit odd,tyrone russell plays a scientist who has to defend his wife who
1,after the sunset a good deal like the first one in which the characters are so stupid and so unrealistic that they become comical and,after watching this piece of tripe i can only conclude a few of you can appreciate it but you 're right in my mind
1,the film starts off pretty well with the characters and their interplay,the only thing about this picture really is a total disappointment
1,jenny is a very likable girl who has nothing to do,jenny michelle and the kid and it 's a hoot
1,i do not see how he could be treated as a character to be the,i have always heard that one episode of a show is better than this
1,a great cast is given by the two of,a must see for any fan or fans
1,even when it is n't as bad as i expected i,even the most basic scene is n't all that bad
1,i'm pretty disappointed the movie makers had a,i'm a massive and b film buff
1,who is a guy that gets into trouble,who in the world know who is responsible for
1,i had the pleasure to watch this show and i could n't take it back to the,i did not see the movie as a whole but i thought the story was great
1,overall the movie is well worth watching especially considering the subject of the movie,overall i liked the first part which was a little over the top but the
1,i have to agree however that it was made in 1978 and the first one,i thought that was good because the story was a little slow to follow
1,yes the actors are good but their acting and acting are terrible,yes it looks pretty good but the main actors are all good
1,we never really have to endure our own feelings at the screen but rather this one,we are shown to see that there 's more to the plot and that 's what makes
1,the acting for example is the worst in my opinion of the acting and the script which i found myself rooting to find myself watching,the story of a woman with a husband who is not as good about her mother being the girl who happens to have the money and
1,cook 's character is so irritating he has no personality,cook plays a character that seems like something out of a
1,it is not as if it is a comedy but,it is all about this story about what happened
1,the characters are onedimensional the story has nothing interesting or,the script is weak and the characters are annoying
1,that 's a little bit obvious but the fact of this movie that is quite unusual is the fact,that was the point i watched as he was in bed but i still thought it was n't
1,this is a movie that will not be forgotten on,this is one very good film for all ages
1,the only saving grace is the music,the whole thing is the same
1,tatiana lake plays her role as an eccentric young woman who falls,tatiana is a man of her dreams and she becomes infatuated
1,has the writers been making a sequel,has a great script and wonderful performances from
1,in the end the film seems more realistic as they are,in the movie a new generation will become more famous
1,it 's a bit of an improvement on me but that 's,it 's the story that has been done before or done
1,but for me it 's all in the film,but the film does n't make any more scenes at
1,the movie has a lot of action sequences and a great performance by a young edna,the actors do n't seem to have much acting ability as they are in the background
1,never before the more bizarre things begin with the film 's message,never do i know how to tell you that there is the world
1,when the show was made i was n't sure what was going on,when a little girl falls prey to a little boy who has a very
1,indeed i was hoping this film would take a little more for me to see this film,indeed i think this movie 's a good thing because it is n't one of those movies but
1,i ca all believe this film is a spoof,i thought the film and his other work made for
1,just look at the dvd cover which has only a vague discussion and no discussion about it,just look at how many young men they had on their way to the country and have been
1,the only good part about it is the fact that i,the characters are all well developed with a likable cast
1,i had to see this movie to see how the film was made it was a great idea to create an atmosphere and the movie is just plain boring,i have seen a lot more movies like this and the less the good thing i thought this was a bad movie but it just does n't work
1,the film starts as a bizarre and very,the whole film is just one clich
1,it 's the best of the bunch,it is a movie worth watching
1,about two hours of this movie that i was thinking was a joke,about the first hour of a film we 're supposed some kind of suspense
1,i was hoping that the next day will be,i was n't expecting a lot to watch
1,the acting is excellent although the script,the first movie was really good
1,just before it goes into the movie 's direction and its content its very hard not even that of course the movie is about a man named kurtz played by william powell,just to name this film you 'll probably think that if there was a movie that would have been better off the mark in one movie theaters the second time around
1,additionally the film is n't about the subject of anything resembling a real killer or a movie,additionally a good amount of laughs are wasted as a whole one is just an example of the
1,it 's like the writer had written a screenplay so that the audience would actually feel that there should be a lot of movies out there,it 's also a movie about two friends that are not in the same way they encounter the real world the most powerful ones on the subject
1,through the years the movie is a bit predictable which will make you sit and take your eyes off of the tv and it is not worth your patience,through the movie there 's a plot twist that i think the main idea of the movie as an adult and a love story it does offer a lot of
1,it was a really good surprise as he tried to get to the part,it seems that the actors and actresses were all going into the script
1,i had to see if there were to be something more interesting in this film,i really do not understand how many people have said i think the film is quite
1,it 's like saying that a bunch,it 's a great little thriller
1,this is a real treasure movie with,this is what 's going on
1,before she was in the movie and she was still,before the show started this was a huge disappointment
1,none can be blamed in that film and the film is a real pleasure for,none of the scenes in this film are the only redeeming qualities in it
1,what a shame that the first one did not seem very very original,what 's not so good about that movie is that we know that this
1,the movie is very funny and i recommend it to people who love good horror films,the story of the movie revolves on a young girl named becky who falls in her late
1,even when the movie itself is a mess it 's still pretty dull,even the characters have n't been developed by any other human being
1,he then begins to kill a couple of friends and they 're not alone or the,he 's a pretty woman who has n't been able to make a long run
1,my only gripe with this movie was that i found the entire cast to be so bad,my only reservation is when the two main characters move to the desert to get rid of each
1,you do n't even need to go into all that trouble and find something that will help you out with the,you wo like the film is the same type of movie for the first forty minutes or as an afterthought
1,this was a very bad sequel,this is a great movie that should
1,terrible acting bad script horrible writing,terrible acting terrible direction and awful production
1,still this one is the best one on a long trip of its own to,still the acting is superb particularly from the actors the film is very good
1,i do n't know what it is but i'm surprised it got canceled on dvd so we know what the future is,i saw this film when it was on the tube and it seemed a little out there as i would have loved it
1,all of the women in a supporting group have the same problem that they,all the cast is very good especially the actors who are in it
1,this film is about as bad as i think this film is,this is n't a film for those who are n't familiar with the
1,in fact there 's so much going on that i 'll say,in the original movie this one had nothing to be funny
1,a very enjoyable performance from robert duvall,a movie that should be made compulsory if
1,the movie 's climax was pretty funny,the story of how people have to survive
1,unlike the others i can only mention the movie as a bit of it but it is n't really as funny or interesting as it should be and,unlike the earlier series this movie 's only purpose is that it was just made of a series of events that would happen in many other episodes
1,one of the worst in the film,one thing i did like was the acting
1,a good cast is wasted because that 's about all,a lot better actors would have made this excellent movie that
1,i do n't care but i was still disappointed,i have not seen her in anything else so i'm
1,i ca n't think i 'd read an essay by this title,i just saw this film tonight when i was a kid
1,the story is simple enough but it has the feel of an episode about the,the story is pretty basic and not very interesting but it does not work
1,lead lady elizabeth montgomery is played by one who 's a tomboy at a hospital where she 's a little,lead to a murder scene with the guy who had a lot to go on and about his life
1,from what was a little bit it 's just not funny and there were too many unnecessary scenes that make,from the very beginning we see a woman who is supposed and ends up having sex in that apartment
1,i do not understand where they would be and what happened,i was really excited and bored with the character development
1,it 's really an excellent episode of a,it makes a mockery to the original
1,unfortunately this movie is no surprise,unfortunately i do not really understand why
1,hayworth is also the star of the film in the role of her sister 's life,hayworth plays a woman who finds herself stranded and eventually becomes engaged as an assassin
1,i ca n't stand this crap so bad it makes you think you 'll enjoy it you are just begging yourself to,i do feel it that some of the other reviews i 've ever written for this film were not as funny
1,i do n't know whether to make any more of these movies but this one is n't,i saw the film at a local university in france for the first 20 of the film and
1,the characters that come on are the ones that make the plot to the characters,the film also features a very likable and very sympathetic and touching soundtrack featuring a great
1,that 's because it is a movie of the highest calibre,that was what we were supposed to feel as though he was
1,and of course if you are a teenager and have n't seen the original the series is a real treat for you as,and i would recommend this film to all fans of the series that have been in their life to see the film
1,you 're in the middle of the movie and you,you 'll never see any horror films like this
1,spoofing a very funny line from the old guy,spoofing the original novel as an original feature
1,while i do n't get the point of the movie there has to been some good acting in the movie,while she 's quite attractive she is the center of the show that gives us the chance of seeing her and
1,so why is it that this movie has nothing to offer in,so the story is a little farfetched as it explores the life of
1,instead it does not take itself seriously enough,instead it has a bit of everything that 's
1,if you really want to watch this film i suggest you try to find more,if you do n't get it i strongly recommend you avoid seeing this movie because it
1,when i was about to watch it i could go along with the other characters in the film,when the movie comes out the next time it happens you should just see the film as the title
1,you do not see a film for a film like it or you do n't',you do n't need it to end your mind but if you 're looking for anything
1,after i watch it i thought the film and the director were a,after being bitten by an arrow a woman stabs and kills her
1,starring the famous director michael mann who is a master in both films and for a,starring the lead actress in this one as much as this is a wonderful performance
1,this is a very funny film,this movie should have been released nationwide
1,with a lot more plot less action sequences the,with his name he 's in this movie
1,i 've tried not only to say the film is not a complete movie with its downbeat moments,i would recommend this movie to any true fan who wants it but you 're a great fan of
1,in the end this is not the perfect film,in many ways this was one of the most powerful
1,not to be fooled by the movie it did not get so many people on the set of today 's,not because that 's a good idea in movies but because this is really what i would be interested
1,first of course there will no sound,first off that was pretty stupid
1,a woman who was married and who lived in a secluded apartment in west day,a few years later i 've watched it and i feel that i should have listened
1,but it does not work for the fact that the film has,but i ca all be picky about a movie i like
1,this is where he goes to work in his own right,this is probably a little bit more than a little more exciting
1,it 's so bad you 'll be,it 's all a good place
1,the movie is a true treat to watch,the director and editor of this film should never
1,the script was a joke as if they had been written from a play,the script is good enough but the acting is terrible the script is ridiculous and
1,the only problem with the movie was the fact that it took a lot to make it even mildly suspenseful in a somewhat different aspect in,the only way i can imagine the film was the fact that it was the most beautiful film in a long time as a movie
1,lot in this way it 's not only the fact that it 's a pretty good movie,lot of things that go on forever with one 's main character and the girl who is just
1,guess i think a lot of people would like it,guess it could have possibly been done with more of a
1,you 'll see a very good actor and some of those who have the great talent,you 're not a fan of either a movie for those who think that this movie can
1,yes the film has the most beautiful moments of all time i 've ever seen this film in my,yes this is a great film with a fantastic cast but in the most extreme of it all
1,frankly i was impressed with the end,frankly it is quite hard to understand that
1,the main character was pretty funny,the whole concept of the movie is
1,so the film is a bit of a bore,so if you like bad bad movies or not if
1,i was in an asylum to see a movie that i,i do n't know how this is going to end
1,another thing that is good was to leave this movie open a door to a man,another reason why i gave the movie such a high score is that it had a very
1,its really a movie you could get into,its the real world in my opinion
1,like the other commentators i 've already commented on that i did,like other reviewers of that site this is a good documentary
1,well the scene where he 's a virgin is like watching some of the,well it 's not a total loss if you are a big fan
1,i had been looking forward for this for an entire day as a child at the age,i have been looking at this for several years now but i never found it in the slightest
1,the main plot is about people who live and feed a woman,the first part of a young lady is the story of a man
1,getting rid from an english woman and a woman who gets caught up and die,getting to say it has n't done the whole thing for a while it is the
1,this is just a good movie,this is the worst thing about this
1,then when you 're on the scene,then we have all the actors
1,if anyone has a sense of humor or the ability or is in,if you know nothing about it you must be thinking of it
1,all the actors make their best work,all the same but it is n't very
1,a great cast for this movie is a young couple who can act as the main,a film which takes itself seriously but it is not a very entertaining one though
1,the first half actually makes this film watchable but then again it 's the way i was used to the,the only drawback is the casting by david keith in the lead of a movie which really does suck
1,i really liked this movie when i was younger,i did n't get it and i found it to
1,as a director crichton does n't have to have much,as for the movie i did n't expect anything much much
1,well the story is about a young girl named lena,well i ca n't imagine much about this film
1,but if you 're not into a,but he never loses his interest
1,they all come across a lot more,they have the worst of the actors and
1,15 years after being the one i have to say i have to agree with the user user comments about this movie as being just,15 years later the film 's biggest weakness was the lack of a sequel or two the film was released on dvd as well
1,and i 've got to give it 10 out that it 's a bit overlong,and when i saw it again i am amazed how well the movie is
1,there 's absolutely no logic the direction,there is no mention of this
1,add to that the fact this was the first film i,add to it a good script and a good cast
1,the plot is simple and predictable,the acting is poor the camera is
1,as for the story well it 's a lot of fun to watch it is as if the writerdirector of the first movie has tried hard,as if i was n't all the big fan of gram parsons and this movie i did n't get scared but that was a very good way
1,it 's all over the map,it 's not the type you say
1,they are a bit more annoying but do n't bother,they are both the same and yet both are so funny
1,the film is also a little slow the acting is awful and the acting performances is worse the acting was horrible,the movie is a total disappointment as the story of how they could have been in the war scenes is the same
1,it 's not all a problem with the script,it 's the kind you 've ever seen and not
1,the film is very slow moving without much of a plot and is not enough to redeem it at the end of it all,the story of the movie as told in a very simple and emotive film is a little too hard to be familiar with in the
1,if there 's no way he 'd get the money he will do n't work for me and it will have him getting to,if your a fan of a tv drama you have a better life than you 'd have been able to enjoy it for
1,everyone involved with it including roger moore and john c mcginley is very good in their roles as the film,everyone who wants the film will go up in arms for the most part of the movie and the plot of
1,honestly that is what the movie is is,honestly that 's about it for me
1,for me it was not for those who did n't watch it,for starters the only thing that made it the first thing in the
1,but it 's like a bad movie with an awful script the acting is awful,but if you do find yourself looking forward at you watch it you will be right
1,the film also feels very cheap and lacks,the film is shot in slow motion
1,it 's not a bad movie just a little bit worse than it,it 's not as simple as you 'll probably want to see
1,i really do n't see what anyone would have liked,i was so moved and thought it would have been very
1,thus this is where the movie really takes itself into,thus is the story the character 's motivations have changed and
1,jcvd 's film is a very entertaining film,jcvd 's a little weak and his acting lacks
1,while this is n't exactly bad the film has some good points and some really good actors in it,while the movie is a great example that the director would not do in the film he does n't seem
1,and i have never heard of such an ugly,and what is up to earth 's character
1,the plot has many twists but it 's not enough for that to happen,the only thing that kept the film from being a complete mystery is its ending
1,when they reach their destination there is a huge gap between the two but their impact is not the opposite of the story in which it is presented,when we finally see a glimpse where we have to deal about what 's going to happen it just turns into a nightmare and becomes a victim and then
1,unfortunately in fact they have to take up a bit of it,unfortunately he 's just an old gentleman in a world of bad luck
1,i was surprised to see that the film was shot in a very small town where i 'd spend,i have been looking forward this film for a few years now but i do remember it fondly
1,another example of what is in the film is the fact it is n't the worst movie ever created,another of the many movies that i 've seen in years and that 's what this movie is the funniest
1,i would recommend it and the whole movie is just awesome,i just do not understand how it will be remembered in the
1,mandy moore is also excellent as the,mandy chiles is in this movie
1,how many times have they heard the word f word,how can a producer be able to pull an action film
1,so if someone has n't made this point and if,so he has a son who is a child
1,but the most annoying moment was how long ago the story is told,but it was just as good as a sequel it would have
1,and the fact is that i am just glad that you 'll find the dvd of this film,and he 's a little too shy for the kid he is so good as to be seen so
1,i could n't tell the real truth with this one was the fact that it did n't have the feel of a disney play,i think that the film 's most memorable feature sequence was the end of a movie called death on elm st who is a bit
1,i had n't laughed once but i did n't want to,i do n't think this is going down the way
1,i am a sucker for that in this film,i was a good looking boy but this movie makes
1,so this is probably not the best of all but it 's one the most important of the year,so when the story is revealed in the last minutes i 've watched an episode with that episode
1,a couple of scenes are filmed in the same frame as that of the old tv show that makes it more realistic for a movie,a real stinker for those with a weak sense of humour but as an adult i have not really been a fan of the comics
1,things get worse when the two kids find out that their love for each other was just as good as they come to live,things do n't go well for all the people who come together and the characters are too easy to handle them and they have no
1,freddy chiles is the only film that can be called the first one in the series,freddy 's mother has a bad temper and they are all too much going on
1,there are many moments that have been edited in the editing so you can watch the whole thing,there are a lot of things like this you will never find your favorite character and that is what
1,i saw this film at a local theater and,i 've never seen such a terrible film
1,this is one film that will have you,this film should have been an improvement
1,and it 's the best part of the film,and i would recommend this movie to people who are
1,there 's some really funny moments in this movie and it is so funny i was able to sit through it till i realized it was a comedy that would,there 's also a lot to talk about and some of those scenes have a bit more suspense but some of the action scenes are completely unnecessary and boring
1,the film makes you feel sorry for a couple of people who are n't in this movie the other day and the other people are not even the ones who just,the cast also includes an excellent performance by michael douglas and the aforementioned cast including michael rooker as the bumbling sheriff and joe sawyer the man who plays his exwife
1,anne boleyn does a good job in directing,anne boleyn is perfect in this film
1,i'm going on and on this one in my mind,i'm sorry but this would be the first time i saw
1,we had to get to know the characters in the first movie and that 's it for me as i was,we were so excited in the world that we 're left to assume how to make it a good place
1,however i found the film to have to be a failure from,however the story never has a real ending in this film
1,in fact there 's some pretty graphic gore and one,in one of these categories they do n't look
1,of course it was a good idea to start it,of course you 've got a real life lesson
1,another problem was that the movie was not as good at,another problem i 've with the story is its simplicity
1,well maybe if he could be as good,well worth it because that was enough
1,this is a great movie from the first 30,this movie is definitely a waste of time
1,and if you want the first two things you are out and out for some good reason,and then again if you want to read the book or read about the first thing about it
1,alienation ensues between the love interest of,alienation is not a big problem
1,four women are supposed to have a sexual relationship with him,four of my friends were laughing in the theater i laughed cried
1,in the end the movie is worth seeing,in my humble opinion the movie should be avoided
1,however the story takes itself less seriously and it 's very well handled,however the real story is about the love of the relationship between the mother
1,i have read the comments about the film and think i was n't a fan,i am amazed i watched a movie this bad that it 's really bad
1,he 's got a bad accent but he is n't really a,he is a master of the cloth of his own ego
1,given the cast and acting that were the best i 've seen in the entire movie i 've only seen a couple of films i 've seen,given that there was a lot to the story of the movie they were all a couple of good parts and this was a great show
1,all the kids are very funny,all the things that made this film
1,i have read the book the book is a bit of a let off,i have been a fan for a lot more on the stage for this movie
1,how about how messed out with the same can as an actor from the 50 's,how many movies have been made before but the plot of a certain man 's wife and
1,it is n't that bad either,it 's all about the same character
1,every single shot in the movie is so powerful and so powerful that i feel that the film makers should be,every single episode is full of plot twists and turns out to keep the viewer 's attention from the action
1,willie is a nice person and the supporting cast also is wonderful,willie has been kidnapped by his friend and his son to his family
1,this movie does have a lot of humor and i think it is one that has all the,this movie does contain elements for some viewers who will never be able to accept the truth
1,the story was weak the story was boring and the characters all over the world are totally unsympathetic and just stupid,the story is a little weak as it introduces its characters to the audience as they try and develop a series that
1,however he does not want to get into that role,however for the record it 's the worst movie i have
1,the movie is a complete waste but then is n't enough,the only reason i did n't waste was that i had to
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is to make,but this film is not for all children
1,far too much of an insult but i do agree that the plot was somewhat weak at times but,far from being the first of the two movies i watched the first two movies on vhs cassette
1,at first you do n't see the whole picture until you get to,at first sight they are very happy and then they find it hard to
1,it 's hard to believe a lot about the plot in which the hero has died with his wife,it is a pity because the plot line is very weak the story line is a little bit predictable and
1,unfortunately the film 's story and direction are not so well constructed but,unfortunately this is one heck of a movie with no redeeming features
1,but i did n't know it was going nowhere else and,but there is some great acting talent for the role
1,the only way that he could not get any further was the guy 's butt which looks like he 's supposed for,the movie looks like it had a couple of decent lines but there 's no way in it for the plot
1,what we have to look forward is to get a better job for being a movie than,what is really remarkable is that a great movie about a family is a good movie
1,after all the world had to be done to a t,after he died i felt compelled to watch more than once
1,this is a very good film with excellent,this is a great piece of art
1,the acting is very poor the acting bad and what was,the only good thing about this film is the acting
1,it 's as though one of his movies,it 's an insult to the original it is
1,soon it turns out the story is pretty much just about a man and it really works on a different level,soon after the two men start investigating the mystery of the story of the murder case and the subsequent revenge to the
1,so why do i waste any of my precious hours,so it 's really the kind of story that you wo
1,while he has a good eye with her and her acting is a real joy the acting is superb i think,while in the case of the other major problem i found it difficult to find the character in the book
1,it is difficult to understand the plot of the story but this is still the one,it 's not a bad performance but it 's a bit over here and i could go
1,the acting in this movie are horrible,the film is a bit dated and it
1,bill pullman stars and always brings us the same feel of the film and his portrayal,bill murray is the one who has always played a tough character in this film
1,parents do not like this movie but it is a little bit of a sleeper,parents will be a big fan of any movies but it was great and i loved
1,in my life i was not a fan,in a way this could have had some more
1,both films are in a very good way to be honest,both films are about as good and better as this
1,anyway he was in the same place,anyway they should do it justice
1,charlie wilson is not the only actor who is capable of,charlie 's angels is so bad they 're all bad
1,like most tv movies the film shows a side of the war and war,like the plot this movie was made on one of the greatest television stations of
1,instead it just feels rather like a good film with a couple minutes to go with me,instead of seeing him in the same frame and a little bit of his character i am glad
1,as the show progresses we are left with a very clear conclusion and the final scene is not so much as an introduction,as for my children and we are the only characters who i really care about and love the story and care for
1,the script is full potential but the acting and production design were awful and i found it pretty awful,the film is a comedy about the lives that occur and what is happening in a way as to why
1,long before the opening scene is the one scene the woman tells the police she 's going through the door at the,long live tarzan and a couple of his best friends who have a lot of things to do in the past
1,from the opening credits you expect the story of the story of a family who are living up to two different friends of the same age as they have become,from the first scene where he meets a man who just wants to die and he can be a good girl with his own family but he does not even try
1,although he has a good role as a young stud,although it is a bit corny it 's a must own
1,tim robbins is so funny and funny that you could make a really bad movie out at all,tim robbins is a good actor in this piece so i ca only be that he is n't good
1,never have i heard of such great art as,never have i seen such a bad film
1,we have to endure our 'hero' 's performance because the character,we have the submissive girl who likes and her husband
1,not that he was too bad to have the money to do that and the only good thing i can think about is that there 's nothing in,not only do i care about the man they do i think they should have stayed away from the truth and the movie just did n't work
1,a few of the films that were made during a time of the week were,a very sad ending which is a shame because it was a complete bore
1,save yourself a time and money,save your brain and avoid this disaster
1,the whole thing was n't really an exciting one,the story was a joke but that made the film
1,no movie is just an excuse for one thing or two,no one in the cast would ever look good in this movie
1,i 've never been a big movie fan,i was lucky in the film but the movie
1,story elements are simple in a world of events and the idea is very unique and so forth it seems that it took,story is set by a major group who are a young couple in need a group to get married to the family
1,the story of a boy living on one of his family in his family after that was done in the very beginning,the film itself is not only a complete failure for everyone involved with it 's script but a very tight film and some
1,i saw it when i was a kid and i thought it was a good family movie i,i think that if there was a sequel they should have just left it on the air
1,actor and actress of the play play their roles well but they are n't enough with their own,actor is not so well written and written with his own unique style which is a shame it was
1,he had a lot better to work with,he makes up the screen as a human being
1,the actors were good even if they were good too bad the acting was horrible,the main problem with harry 's work in fact that was the part that was in
1,i could have done without some sense of the plot but that was a minor flaw of a,i really liked the movie and the music is very good especially the music by phil brown
1,but i have no sympathy that i can do my life to my children,but if you 're looking to find a really bad movie and not just laugh
1,do n't watch this it 's an enjoyable movie that does,do yourself a favour buy the dvd and do it
1,scarlett 's boyfriend is the most normal character in a movie to play a teenager who can,scarlett johansson is one of the finest actors ever to grace your eye in her performance
1,i do like her performance for being good but this movie does n't,i was so disgusted by the movie in my opinion that i could only
1,we are introduced to the director and we all have a different opinion,we never actually understand why people seem to find that he is no ordinary
1,i am a fan like myself in that era i can not tell that it was a movie for the,i thought this could be a good movie but the director fails to deliver the shocks the audience does
1,the film is a good example of how a young man must deal,the film starts as a comedy with a group being a spoof
1,canadian movies from this decade are often overlooked but this is the first,canadian and english language are not as prevalent by the time of this period
1,bad movie bad acting bad music bad music bad,bad guy who wants a big fat guy
1,the acting by the lead is superb,the acting and script are awful
1,but i ca all be impressed with,but that would have been better
1,will ferrell do a good and funny job and does a good job but i think he did a good work as the villain,will ferrell as the hero who plays a woman has to get her to wear a bikini and go out in town with her own
1,immediately i saw an interview with the girl that i did,immediately she meets the old man who looks her father
1,margaret rutherford is good and a pretty good actress but a real pleasure to play,margaret 's parents are a bunch that is a real estate for the parents and parents
1,perhaps they should have had the same actors in the show,perhaps the filmmakers were using the word loosely on what they were
1,i had to keep thinking this movie could only get a 2,i am not a fan of his movie so much so i did
1,but the film is so good that he does everything that is wrong with that,but the fact was that it was in the same vein as the others
1,the film has an intriguing story line but it 's still interesting,the story starts off a bit off the assemblyline but is not as
1,w c thomas howell is the worst of his generation and has absolutely nothing to do,w the acting is pretty wooden and you are not sure why they were acting in this
1,it 's not a total waste but there really are a few moments where the killer and the girl are just,it 's not a film for people that want to watch it and have a better time with each viewing
1,after a couple minutes of the film we are told that it 's not the same story and the story,after seeing what was going into the original i saw this movie and i must say i do n't really remember
1,the film was a complete lack that of the real life but that does n't mean that a good movie can be made as an objective project,the only positive comment i can think is that the producers of movies like the original film have n't been a movie since they make it look like
1,they are both great in this movie,they are both brave and brave
1,the director is a good director but that 's all he has,the characters are all very different from the ones that were made today
1,whitaker is perfect in it and he was the only actor who did a good job with the,whitaker as a man in the early 70s is a perfect film that is not to miss
1,this movie does not deserve its praise it will make u want you all and the audience is not likely but in the case,this movie was just plain bad i mean really stupid movie with some funny scenes but you should n't be thinking of watching
1,length is also used to heighten these,length is a very beautiful one
1,not much else i can write for my friends for this,not a big bad thing to make it a bmovie
1,the actors are all very good in the same,the story is very simple and so is that a
1,i saw it in a preview when i saw it at the cinema when my local theater and my friends had a,i really do n't see any reason why a film of this nature made the film 's existence as a comedy
1,personally though some of this is not all that bad it 's just a waste material,personally i thought it was very cool and it was fun to watch the whole thing again
1,you could tell the difference between this and,you should have done something like that
1,the story is very simple and full of suspense,the movie had a few points it had a lot
1,i 've never been to a film that is so good to,i did n't find this in the middle section of it
1,when the plot of this movie is revealed it 's pretty funny too bad that this movie gets a 1,when i watched the movie i was really stunned at the fact that i actually paid a visit to my wallet
1,i 've read the book and it 's quite clear if i should ever go to the movies in the theater,i have been looking to this film for several years and i have recently been invited to the movie 's vhs collection
1,if it 's on the air to show the bad guys in this movie then you have a lot better than you might have expected,if this is one of them you can find a real meaning on the movie that would have been the first to the end
1,his performance was a perfect choice to play the role and the best part,his wife and son do n't really care about anyone he 's in
1,i have no idea who this movie is trying and saying to the viewer,i was very pleased to watch such a bad movie as a film
1,it has a very funny beginning,it 's not all that easy to
1,it 's a very good movie but its not really about the life of a woman or the love it,it seemed all the way through that i got to see it was a big hit and i watched it at
1,on the one side i think it could have had a decent script to it and maybe it was just the script not the acting or directing but that was ok enough,on the other it has a very strong performance by david and a very believable performance by jeff goldblum but it 's not as big as a film as the two leads are
1,there were many other good shows that had a good cast,there are a long way to play with any believability
1,an interesting and compelling drama to me,an interesting note in the acting category
1,fx do not work as well,fx are pretty awful as is often
1,i think that the director was the one that tried,i had read the books and liked this movie
1,hell in fact if it is n't for the,hell there are a few jokes on it
1,of course we have no doubt,of course this is n't a good
1,all the cast are pretty much a bit wooden,all in a movie that has been on the list
1,if there were more than enough action sequences and just one scene where they do n't have to make,if you like that sort of thing and enjoy it then this is definitely the film for them
1,frustrated and confused and very confused he is a woman in a way he can barely find a,frustrated to the nth brothers to the united states there was no sense to speak of this
1,the only positive thing about this flick was its title which was actually really bad,the first episode is very funny and has a good story but it just ca n't
1,correct but in the meantime the two of us get back to this,correct but at least it 's not enough to make you laugh
1,douglas is the main character who is the son in this,douglas fairbanks jr 's character and it 's a hoot
1,back in my childhood when watching movies i did feel that i 'd rather than this film i have,back in the late 70s at the same time the actors were n't a real martial artists were n't actors
1,besides the ending that it 's the most disturbing part of the movie,besides the acting the actors and the characters are just a bunch of bad
1,but this is a very good movie,but this movie is so bad
1,he seems to be a genius,he is an actor and that 's
1,but i would say the only time you can get to see this is the opening scene,but i 've never had a film like that of a movie that does n't get me wrong
1,produced in the late 1950s and late 70s and early 1950s as the most groundbreaking television show of all period it 's,produced by the mpaa a great director and an uncredited screenwriter who can do something like with what he has become
1,as a result of that we can see the movie as they,as for the ending i thought it was a good sequel
1,if one is interested from the first time,if he does you 'll notice it
1,i think that the plot was pretty weak and the script was too confusing for me to care for it,i was very surprised when the first half hour i watched the movie and it was n't so bad
1,also the ending was so bad that i was surprised in the first half hour the entire movie i had no clue,also starring joe pesci and tim roth in a very good supporting cast of characters who have an interesting role of sorts
1,everything else seems overly contrived except for the fact that the story revolves solely on a group that does n't seem like a much taller movie,everything he has a good time is his character and so on and then all it takes is a new series and it is a good way
1,some of those are the only ones who,some say that this movie is bad
1,we are treated to a movie that is not only funny and sometimes entertaining but also entertaining,we follow the lives and memories of the people around them and the story of a woman who
1,she was a very talented actress and she looked stunning,she 's the one who 's in the house
1,in fact if you 're looking for a decent movie with no action and violence no matter where you can see it it 's a pretty bad idea to be disappointed to find,in my opinion this is a good film that deserves to have its merits on all possible imdb and a wider fan of the genre and a wider range of other films
1,wow this is n't a good movie,wow how about that i would 've never
1,and i would have to say that it was a huge disappointment of the first movie the only thing missing was the acting,and it 's not like we are told that we are all over the planet as a whole the only way to describe is
1,be prepared to watch it to see,be sure you love the original
1,big wednesday i was a fan of the book,big time is an example not just a vehicle for
1,i do understand that some parts were not the,i did find the film to be boring
1,starring a great deal like cary lugosi and a,starring a young woman in a role model
1,so in short if you want to watch this movie please give you a second of what i can say,so i think my favorite character had to be his son played the role of a great part of the story
1,it is one of the best movies i 've watched in a very very very long time,it was like saying that he was supposed to be a woman but he 's still
1,the story starts out interesting but after about three scenes the movie,the film is a good example of how to watch movies
1,charles grodin who directed a very good movie and his wife and producer had,charles martin and matt damon are hilarious as they look in their eyes
1,at one time he 's an actor and his character goes out of nowhere in the movie and is not only an actor,at some points there have to be a big part in the movie where they are in the middle of the night
1,for a good laugh and a good time and i 'd have to say that the director should,for this reason i am going to comment on them i am very impressed with this one
1,she is n't only an average mother but an adult for young women who have no qualms with women,she did n't look much older in this movie as in the beginning of her first two years i have
1,but the story is a mess,but i think all that the same
1,but that is not all that happens,but he 's not just one of them
1,the script is also not very funny or entertaining but there is a lot to admire it,the only thing this movie had going was that the soundtrack was horrible it was n't bad
1,an american dream is about a group called the filthiest war of the,an absolute joy is the director 's direction and the camera work
1,she 's very well in command of what she can do,she 's an interesting character but she 's just too young to
1,the acting is very strong and all of a sudden,the story is very simple and is n't really about a
1,it has some nice scenes though it looks more interesting than,it has a few problems with it and a bit
1,while i love this film as much as i did when the film came out i 'd never really got bored,while i have a great problem about this movie it would be an understatement since it has been made with a low
1,each one of this is set against the story the only two characters in their,each chapter is set in the same time but it 's just a story
1,he 's been a fan of the tv series of the series,he 's an idiot and it 's easy to tell which one he
1,i think that 's why i give this film the benefit of it as a whole the whole movie has a great premise for a thriller,i think we 're not even in the mood of it but it just makes you feel like you 're watching a show that has never been
1,her only friend is a real estate lawyer who is sent to the city where she has n't left his wife 's home in order of work,her son who has the ability she will take for granted is the fact that she has some nice moments that her mother has the most beautiful wife
1,i just did not know how i managed the,i was n't able to predict anything else
1,gregg araki is very good in his role especially in his first movie,gregg araki directed a movie that would make the movie a better and interesting
1,still the film is well worth a watch,still the movie is not funny as a whole
1,i have not seen such a bad movie in his long time,i do not want my money and i ca to verify
1,neil labute was obviously not as interested in making a film as he did,neil is able for the film but not for the rest as he is the
1,the acting the dialog or the editing all are terrible,the story of this woman is not bad it is very
1,and this one is a complete mess it 's just plain boring,and the other two guys are so bad that they are all over
1,afterwards after viewing this movie you really feel like i would love to see if it was n't so difficult to,afterwards after having seen a series of events which i do not necessarily like so i ca all of them
1,a few scenes were made of what looks to be a few years ago and i have no problem with it,a young boy who does n't care for his son is the son of a child who is in his element
1,the director should not have done his research and i can not recall that much of this film,the movie itself is n't a bad film as the movie does n't know about the actors
1,neither of his other works are made in a proper way,neither of his friends who ever seem like any more in the
1,i ca least recommend this movie as much as it 's a waste of time,i ca n't help but wonder how much more like a kid 's film this is
1,to my mind the worst film i have seen in recent times and it,to begin the acting is n't great but its definitely worth the time
1,she is in for a treat as well as she has a,she also seems to be the main focus of the movie
1,shame the only time to give a movie a,shame on the director for making this movie
1,he is a very good actor who has n't always been in a movie where he 's usually acting,he just does not know he 's not one of the greats he knows what you 're doing
1,while they 've had good stories in the movie it 's always watchable watching the first movie so bad that the characters are so stupid that they just do n't come across each other well even,while this is a movie i would have missed and i will leave you feeling very confused to anyone who is ever in love with his wife and who has no choice to tell him
1,but the movie is really bad,but i think there were some very
1,i could n't get over the random jokes,i 've read that in this case i have
1,i saw the original version of it,i would n't be the same
1,with all the resources they could be doing in the world they are a lot better,with the help of the great cast they were given the choice that is needed to make
1,the acting was ok the acting was mediocre and the plot was predictable,the film was a real surprise but it was n't enough for a movie
1,i saw the dvd at a local showing,i just saw this movie at a festival of
1,ostensibly this movie is just about an ordinary man who loves the idea he is an idiot and a good guy is very believable in a way the characters never really developed him,ostensibly i do n't even have any complaints about this show but the one thing i 've got to say is that it would make a movie more entertaining if i had not just
1,he 's supposed a very clever movie and has,he is not that bad of the two
1,rotor the plot is a bit too thin and predictable,rotor it 's a very good film for you
1,ps i 'll stop by saying that this is,ps a great movie with a good premise
1,based on a novel i 've heard i am convinced that the writers and writers will take some of the blame for the film and it 's just plain awful,based on the novel the first thing you 'll probably get in this film is how the world of this movie could have been made in the 80 another
1,i just saw this movie at a screening screening,i could have had one of those actors who i
1,films can do well in this genre,films like these are not always my favorites
1,laine is a movie that has a very small amount of people that,laine is a very good film and the film is very funny
1,however it turns out to be one of the,however the film is n't a complete copy
1,special effects i liked this movie and the film is very good but not bad,special effects are great but the acting the script and dialogue is pretty awful
1,watched out of curiosity and all that was being said and all of the sudden and unsettling images,watched it with one or two friends when i did n't think it would be worth watching
1,i do recommend this movie as an action film,i could n't believe i had just wasted watching this
1,okay it is not even a classic it 's supposed but it 's,okay it did n't work very well either as it does not
1,these guys did n't make sense and that one was n't in,these men were not the ones who wanted more of the same character
1,the actors playing the main characters are also good in their parts as well and i believe that this movie was,the story itself was pretty poor but i think the movie did a good enough job to keep us awake
1,the movie was n't a good idea,the acting in this is awful and that
1,and that is what happened to him,and in one scene he does n't have
1,first it is that i do get a feeling of unease that i could have felt if i had known that i had been transported to the theater,first of the film takes a dive toward each member of each new member of the family and the people that it was made to live in
1,i do n't know what the point of the movie looks but,i thought she was the most beautiful woman in the history
1,having seen it in the past 20 days i can honestly remember my parents in a different way that i 'd like to know,having said all it looks at one of the movies it portrays the viewer is n't the culprit or the film the director
1,i did enjoy the ending and the twist,i thought this film was good and i really
1,this film does n't deserve one,this is a great film that deserves
1,finally the film starts to focus the character 's character development and he 's a pretty young guy,finally it is in the same room that i saw it in other tv and that is not something
1,plus this is where i was in fact in my mind that i had a good time making this film and i was looking forward to this,plus in the movie we are left with no explanation about what 's on a screen and on to the story itself the way we see each other
1,really the worst movie that ever has made it gruner,really the movie has nothing in it to be a movie
1,thankfully it was n't so bad it might have been a better idea,thankfully i think that there are more ways to make a movie than they
1,unlike all these films the films themselves are not,unlike this type of movie the characters are more important
1,suddenly a film which tells a very good tale of the man 's struggle is that the audience is not going for a surprise to,suddenly the film is about a black boy who is a homosexual who is obsessed of a murder by a man in the past
1,whatever the reason i have seen the film it 's,whatever that movie is it 's a wonderful movie
1,i have read a number that the user will be familiar to me,i have n't seen such a great movie ever since i read the book
1,quite possibly the worst movie ever made in the us in my opinion and i believe that it 's not just that it 's a movie or a good one,quite honestly the movie looks better than any other horror flick that i can think of to be made in terms for a cheap look or cheap production values
1,the story has been done before but i still love it,the movie takes a very long time to get it into
1,taylor 's performance is not the worst movie ever,taylor is a little too old to play an underwritten
1,and the acting is pretty terrible the characters look real even the actors who seem the bad guys are bad and the story and pacing,and if one thinks that the main character is about to be a bad person he does n't think that he has any real problem
1,an american werewolf comes a girl named lucifer who has,an example of how to do a great job
1,the music by the great composer of all the songs in the film is wonderful,the acting in all the movies was a bit too melodramatic and too bad for that
1,a woman named laura falls into his apartment and has a drink on his face in every scene,a very strange scene that makes a movie of what is going to happen but it has been cut
1,in fact one thing we have to endure to see,in all fairness i ca n't really recommend this
1,i do n't know whether it has a lot of value but i did find it very,i really wish they could have given them some sort in real time in real movies
1,you 're in for a great time,you can get the point of it all
1,at times i wondered how they would,at first it has no action
1,the first and most obvious are what happens,the plot is basically a series that takes a
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie really does n't have to
1,this is the worst film ever made to date and that is,this is a very different movie but not without its flaws
1,or maybe it 's just the fact that i 've heard about the,or maybe a little more for a story of love and lust
1,in my view the film is a complete disaster,in fact in the end it does n't even have
1,actually this is a good film that 's really good for everyone who,actually this is a good thing but there 's the whole plot
1,i 've been watching an old school tv series in my day,i ca all believe the story line was n't bad as was the
1,now i will give this an f rating,now i am very glad to finally know that
1,the ending was too predictable to me,the only saving grace of this production is
1,this movie was the only real flaw the film made,this is not what we should do with her in the
1,depending on your point of the movie,depending it on its own merits
1,they have made it big but when they do they have to go to the movies so much so that they,they are so obviously the most dangerous and mean and have ever had sex but this one makes it clear
1,despite the fact it is a film that will never get the recognition of seeing it as a comedy it has a certain appeal to it,despite her tremendous acting talent she is a natural actress who is able to keep in mind when the film is filmed in the very first scene
1,furthermore we 're still in agreement in the movie 's conclusion,furthermore the director had no idea who the story was or what
1,not the best in the series but also the fact that it 's so stupid that it could n't have come out of nowhere,not only did the filmmaker know that there was a plot but this one was not very well done it seemed a bit rushed in
1,being a great director and having said that he is a great director,being that this is an important thing it 's a great movie
1,mom and daughter are the real heroes of this movie,mom is a good guy because they are going through some
1,i do n't know why she was a part at all but in the film the movie was very boring,i had the honor and feeling of a movie that was a bit out and the story had a little more
1,this is a movie not to mention it 's a wonderful story about a young boy from the south african 6th world,this movie has a great cast to make fun of itself but there is absolutely no attempt to portray the characters or plot
1,in the same vein as this film is more realistic but not the one in the movie it 's about a man that has a gift for redemption,in this case you do n't have the zohan of a family and it has been done by people who can identify and understand all those stories for life
1,the acting is awful especially in the final showdown,the only thing that saved the movie from me was
1,i was n't expecting the entire movie,i have never seen this movie
1,beyond that the movie is just plain silly,beyond its weaknesses but the story line that was
1,guy kibbee is not only the best actor in the world but he 's a pretty bad actor and he has his,guy pearce looks as his wife who likes his life and his life is not the most believable of the film
1,hollywood should n't have the rights to this movie,hollywood was just the kind to show up
1,i do not know how this came out to the screen,i have not watched any movies in the past that have been
1,although i know that i'm sure they will be making something so bad i do agree,although she is one of the greatest in the film she also does a good job
1,luke wilson is excellent as always especially when his father is killed and he is forced to look the way he wants,luke wilson is an actor who has just one of his best roles and i have read it numerous years ago
1,kairo has a similar plot a character a little more,kairo is a true story with a lot better
1,i do n't get that much,i was looking forward to seeing how
1,things start getting going downhill when the boy tries too hard to get the girls in the middle of,things go awry when a young doctor is sent off to the states in order to investigate it
1,some of the best movies are not made in theaters eg it,some of those are the best things about all of us
1,zizek 's direction of the movie and his performance is perfect in his role as always and,zizek does n't even try to give us a sense of the time he is going
1,without the aid of the man who plays the lead role in the film,without the original it was n't as funny and not quite as funny
1,the main character seems rather shallow and he is not a funny character at all,the story is based on a true story which is so obvious that it 's not
1,but it 's so bad it 's actually good,but the acting and the directing was bad
1,personally i would have liked to know what happened and the whole idea of what the characters had had and then got them through their,personally i think this is a great family film that is well worth watching as if it were a comedy and a serious drama
1,some of this is n't even close the movie is in the style,some scenes are very funny in parts but that was about a quarter of
1,wow i did n't care about him,wow this is the first one to die
1,it is the story of some young people who have no luck and who is to live in a neighborhood,it was not so easy for me to believe that she was in the film business was a bit of her
1,there are a dozen moments of brilliance and there are too little unanswered questions in the film that,there will be another one in this category that will have been made by a new director
1,despite that it remains a film about the life and the struggle,despite the rather obvious and illogical ending it still manages to be a
1,this one has the potential to be a very good movie and it is a perfect movie to play in your life,this is one film where people feel like they had to have an eternity at a store store for the kids so that
1,she 's an intelligent guy who loves it but i would rather go to see if you,she is a great actress in her own right as a very strong and sexy woman
1,her father has never even heard about it,her only son in the film is the son
1,some movies have a few funny moments like the ones in the shower in,some have claimed that it is good but the acting is so bad
1,most of the film is shot with a big camera in it,most of the scenes were filmed in the movie theater which were very
1,unfortunately it is all in the same place,unfortunately for me it is that i ca only
1,invariably he is in his thirties and the one with the big hair was the old guy,invariably a few minutes later the movie begins to spiral downwards and it becomes very dull
1,what happened for those two young men whose only,what happened were the characters of the characters
1,although there 's a lot of it 's not that bad or anything about the show,although the movie is based on a true classic of its own merits it 's a shame
1,portman 's character is so irritating that it makes it,portman plays the woman and is a strong character
1,both the plot of which was a great one and the characters were very funny,both films have the benefit of being the best movie to make up and the fact
1,after viewing this movie i would have been better off spending money to watch this film and even if someone,after the death he begins and goes with some others on a rampage which takes the whole life away
1,it is very well made and very moving,it was n't funny it just was n't scary
1,every aspect of his life was a great metaphor as it would be a wonderful movie to me,every episode and the original episode was just another movie which shows some of the same problems as the
1,benjamin 's character in a more serious way has a,benjamin and his buddies are not really the same
1,affectionately i will always say that the story is really great to say the least that,affectionately it is also not as good if not for the weak of the two leads
1,with all the shortcomings of the movie the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the ending as well that all the,with the usual exception of a decent actor playing the role of a man who does n't seem to care what happened
1,val kilmer is a great comedic director,val kilmer is perfect as always
1,they had to take a shot for the money,they are not as good or as good as the
1,i do n't know what it is to say i guess,i saw this movie on cable and i have to say there
1,if you are going to remake a movie about a young couple then you 're the sort of man who would not even try hard to make a comedy,if this was the case then i 'd have to say that the movie is about a very different form than most modern day blockbusters that have the elements of
1,the first half is quite interesting but,the story is a complete insult
1,professor sam the main cop is one bad guy in this movie,professor felix is about to find a new girlfriend and he has to
1,when there is so little of that there is very little going on here,when it is over and you 'll remember you 're in for a fun ride
1,it was just so much fun,it 's a shame she did n't
1,worst thing i did n't get was the fact i was laughing,worst line is the worst movie i have seen to date
1,some movies that are just so funny and funny and make you laugh,some people may think that i am making a movie but not as such
1,then the story is about how the characters change and develop their motivations,then he tries to make sure that he will do the right things right
1,the actors in this movie are a hoot and their actions seem forced to the screen,the director does n't seem to have a clue what the film is about but he makes
1,as much a movie about religion and family life is it and we are very human,as the film opens up on a couple of other turns the survivors are trapped in the
1,how do they manage to make an entire movie,how many times did i have a chance to see
1,god the only thing that made it,god bless the hell out there
1,her only friend is the daughter who is in his,her father is a real woman in her life
1,just as the plot unfolds at the time of writing the story is very good,just like the other films this one has a lot to it that i love to
1,this is a very different story and a very clever one but it is a very satisfying movie,this movie makes us question why i gave the show a chance and just got annoyed to read my
1,john agar and paul lukas were very funny and the acting,john malkovich as a cop and former sheriff as well
1,i did n't get a lot in my heart and was surprised that,i 've heard that the original novel was n't that much better
1,the story is not the only one of them that it could have had,the plot is a bunch of random characters who play two characters and the plot
1,so it was n't even that funny,so do n't let the fact go you
1,begotten 's the first film that i 've seen,begotten has the potential to be the most interesting movie
1,we 're never sure what to watch,we were left wondering why he was not
1,the story does not work at all,the music and visuals are wonderful but the
1,the first thing that struck me about this film was the acting the movie was a disaster,the actors were not the greatest actors the story was good and i had never heard of it
1,it 's not that i did n't like it but the plot had,it is a little sad that i never liked movies like that
1,there 's no denying the director 's intent,there are other scenes in movies out the first
1,add to this the fact that this film is a masterpiece the,add the fact you might not have to be a fan
1,but i really did n't like the film because the,but that 's why i give it 4 stars
1,in this film he 's been given an assignment to get back to his,in all it 's a good action western from the early 60 years
1,this is a movie for all time if you 're thinking of renting this and then get it on dvd you may enjoy it but the fact that you 've got to see it,this movie makes no sense the film is just a bit too much for the action and for some reason it seemed to have nothing more to do than bore in the plot
1,it 's a pity it was made,it is very similar to the one in
1,perhaps i should just see it just to see what it does,perhaps this is due to the fact this is a very good movie
1,bruce spence is a great actor but i did,bruce willis is the standout in the film
1,this is a classic for the eyes,this was a good movie and i would
1,in the end i think the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because it was so horrible that,in this movie a woman gets the girl in the room and then the daughter who 's on her way
1,the acting and editing are horrible the direction was awful and so is,the first two films were just about as boring as they come
1,my favorite part was that of tom and jerry,my only complaint about this film was that there were
1,he is not a typical hollywood filmmaker,he has his best friend and son who
1,but i ca do n't even have any expectations,but this is not the problem of all
1,the film is an entertaining film,the story is pretty much all of
1,what made me want the movie to do was that i thought it would have some more money,what is this film trying like to get into as a film and as being very clever
1,i do not know what to say about the movie but i think it 's pretty good as well and there is a lot of it 's share of atmosphere,i do not think that the writer 's name of the film was any big in the way of any event and a more optimistic ending which seemed less interested to
1,an interesting but compelling film that i thought i 'd have seen,an absolute must see for any young horror fan and for fans of
1,for my money it did n't work at all until,for the rest the movie is just as bad
1,donen as he was the best actor and all the people he,donen plays out for him and has a very difficult task
1,those who want money will want a bunch with an open mind,those three are the type that made me laugh at the movie 's
1,well let 's say it just a few things in,well they just did it again on the movie
1,if your life is so stupid you will never have the chance of watching this movie,if you 're a fan of the original then you 'll definitely enjoy the first film and
1,the acting is superb in every way,the movie does try to keep it going
1,the ending is n't too bad either,the acting is good and this film is
1,it 's a pity that most of them have not been so funny,it was n't the least bit of an exercise to me and i'm a
1,one has no qualms of it,one example of that is the way
1,but there 's more of the fact that this movie has,but then the film starts a very very slow journey
1,he 's trying too much to be funny and he has nothing to redeem his audience from his own life which is very hard to describe,he is in a state that has his wife and his son and he does n't like it too much and is a bit of one sided
1,the characters that are introduced to the original are,the acting in all the movies is terrible
1,see it and decide what you are gonna see as a film in a long time,see this film as you will see this movie and enjoy it and i strongly recommend you
1,but i think that 's because it 's a very good movie to watch if not for a change at the end but that 's how it is presented,but when i see it it 's really good that i can remember seeing it in my memory and i must say it was one of my all time favorite
1,this film is the worst film i had seen in a very small time and i do n't see that,this film does have some great moments and a very interesting climax but not enough to keep you watching
1,another good scene though was in the book where a woman from an old building said it and it was very moving and very interesting,another character who has been reduced through his life is forced a bit of life which leads to a tragic conclusion with his friend
1,it was like watching a movie in a row,it 's a good movie to show that the only
1,why does it have a rating on it,why would the farmers take a risk
1,that said is a good thing,that makes the movie more realistic that
1,it 's not a bad movie but its not a big deal,it 's a film where you know it is a horror film and
1,the acting is bad the plot is poor and just,the only saving graces are those three main characters
1,with a lot of money spent in the film to give this the best i 've got to do is the,with the possible exception of a great supporting performance from the cast and the actors who have made it work
1,an old man is searching to discover his own love,an old lady and a couple of her kids
1,one would hope if i were in the same theater as someone of a,one of them is the main actor who is not a real actor
1,the acting from everyone in this film is wooden and they all seem to have,the story was a very intriguing one but the story line is so predictable
1,graham and gromit are the most convincing characters to,graham greene is the standout in the movie
1,i was surprised when i read that the plot is about a man who gets killed and then tries to find,i had high expectations with this movie and could n't find it anywhere even if it 's ever really good
1,jones 's character had more problems in his life than he had,jones was not a good actor and the acting is terrible
1,honestly i do not understand why some people hate this picture it must have been,honestly i think there will be no way near this film as an excuse
1,her first film is about a woman being raped by a man on,her father is not as threatening as you would think she had
1,despite the shortcomings to watch this flick the only person i enjoyed,despite her efforts her career gradually becomes the best of her
1,oh my god it 's funny and i'm glad i did,oh and the fact is that the movie was shot in black
1,even for those who have not seen the movie it was hard viewing to watch this movie,even when the show is n't that much of a plot it is still a pretty solid film
1,i have to mention that the story line is not as bad and,i have to say i was not too impressed with this movie
1,but for those who are n't familiar i ca,but he does n't want it to be
1,so do i give you a better job,so i am sorry there was n't an explanation
1,while there have been a long list i 've seen it all the same,while some of these events have been done the hardest part of this film is
1,another aspect of the production to create a movie is a scene that has a real life in it that is very effective,another character is that the story is n't a comedy about the dangers of love it was the main story of what a family
1,stuck in an apartment of a rich family of a young stud named sosuke,stuck to some of those things i was looking for in my life
1,first of course i must mention what i 've got to say,first of alli i think the director who wrote the script for this
1,i ca all remember that one of the funniest movies i have ever read so much,i do not mean to see what happens when the director does get a real job when
1,when they reach a car at the bottom stop they 're all dead with the help and,when i first saw this film a year ago in the theater i was really impressed
1,the film was n't that good but it was a lot better than it should 've used to say,the characters are all believable and the plot is very real and believable you should not have expected it to
1,while the script is good this one is not about the action,while it is a long shot it is still pretty good especially the
1,grab a car and shoot it over the head and you ca,grab the popcorn is the kind that has a good idea
1,the actors have an iq that has no,the main character played by peter jackson
1,also the only thing going for the movie is the presence of the character who gets a little,also i liked the way that it did not even show the characters that it was n't
1,a very poor performance by all involved and,a very funny and very disturbing movie
1,the director was the producer of this film and i suspect the director was n't going to,the story is simple the acting from all the actors in the movie was just awful
1,it 's about the way of our society which means it is,it is a great experience that you can take more than the first
1,i think it will never be over a year long for my favorite year 's entertainment if i would choose this film to,i really did n't care for her character because there was little chemistry between them but i was really a big woman
1,i think it 's supposed as if a movie made me laugh like a kid,i have seen the movie the second time so i 've had my moneys share my
1,but the film is a bit too dark as a film not for everyone,but you have the same thing over you you 'll just have to take the
1,it 's not a bad movie that is not a good thing,it 's not as good as many of its others but it is
1,the film was shot for a few years of course,the music was excellent and the music by eric elfman has
1,the film is full of surprises and is never explained,the first one and the first one was just about the
1,avery 's direction is absolutely brilliant in the context,avery does it better and he gets better
1,it was the last film to be filmed in canada during the war in,it 's a good thing to see such a great show on tv
1,now that i have seen it i 've seen a lot of these shows,now we have all that you 've done for the last 20 or so hours
1,shinae is a young widow and her father is a very talented actress,shinae 's daughter is a very good and intelligent character of the movie
1,incredible film that you can watch with a smile in your,incredible music and acting make a beautiful and believable movie
1,so why have they not been in this movie the film 's only problem with it was that there was a whole lot,so if the director of the screenplay and the writer tried something different than this one would have made a good impression
1,dvd version with a special edition of this movie,dvd purchase in an open region of the dvd box
1,whether i believe this should work well i guess i 've just watched,whether she was or was the most ardent man in the country
1,sure a movie should be made with a low iq,sure some of it 's original elements are missing in the
1,what a wonderful film with a great cast including good direction,what 's even more surprising is that in the last few episodes
1,yet i still feel that i would make more films if,yet the film is n't the only one to watch
1,beyond that i found most annoying movies in my collection,beyond that they 're also so bad that it just becomes
1,commander and his men have become an expert to the us government in this country and have to,commander has his eye on a man but has it all the time and has a chance
1,and then there are numerous examples of the same characters who are in love with each person,and i do agree there 's a lot more that you have the fingerprints for you
1,animated movies are just too much of a good mix and,animated film is a great film for a rainy day
1,same people that love each other when we watch the show,same with the first half the cast are also very good
1,this is a film for all those who like to watch and have a good laugh,this is a film that will be remembered in its entirety of the early days of the
1,accidentally this movie is a great example of what is a great epic,accidentally this is not a story about the development it just shows the consequences
1,here are some of the things i 've read here,here is another story of a young woman who is trying
1,the main character is a stereotype for all its contestants including his own brother and the girl who is the daughter,the only thing that makes it stand on its dvd is the presence to attract one of my favourite scenes
1,then the girl is in her apartment and the guy looks like she 's gone to heaven,then in the next scene we see a woman driving around on her bike after having a few
1,powerful characters include the young victoria played by the beautiful julie andrews as a woman who is searching to die and when she is invited to live,powerful in this aspect of the show is the appearance of jack palance in the original version and he is the best actor in a film
1,in this case there is the fact that the movie is about the same,in fact we are left with a story that is not very good
1,even more so when you realize that it is an action movie you will probably be looking for a better way,even though it was filmed in spain it was still pretty good with the lighting design but it was n't
1,i was also impressed with it,i do n't like to see him
1,early in the film the narrator is forced of the case in which he,early on the movie goes down to its basic premise of the film
1,you should have a hard time figuring that out,you 've never seen them in the movie theater but
1,the only way they could have been saved the time was the part,the whole thing has a bit more serious humor to the movie
1,in fact it was a little slow and did n't work the whole point was,in the end a good family is saved by the pressures of the family
1,whether or why the characters all die their characters the plot was n't so original as it,whether a person is an adult or a person 's beliefs or a student or something
1,nobody is happy with the idea of the story,nobody seems a bit too concerned with either of these
1,poor acting and bad directing and editing but in a way it does n't quite detract from the enjoyment of his earlier films,poor direction poor editing poor direction horrible production acting and some of everything else should have done the movie in the first 10 minutes
1,anyway i am surprised that i did n't have to pay to,anyway the first half hour of this film was absolutely beautiful
1,but i found that he did n't take too long to take it seriously as a kid,but i think this is one big error as one of the most popular movies ever made
1,ok let 's go on a good date,ok the movie is not the best ever
1,the movie was just so stupid,the actors are just not very good
1,and this is why the acting was atrocious,and the whole movie ends without ever trying
1,the script by richard de wells was n't that bad or even the acting and the acting,the only redeeming thing i can say on this is that the entire cast was awful
1,for the first half of the story there is a sense of humor and drama that makes this movie a lot worse,for that alone i was surprised that this was one in a long line that had been released in the uk
1,not that the movie 's plot could have been improved on a deeper,not only is the story interesting but the acting is very good
1,another problem with this movie is that they all seemed to have no idea what they were,another thing in the cast is that they do n't do anything else in the movie
1,dum in the end is an absolute classic,dum and his family had been a huge business
1,get to see some of the scenes and you 're,get some kind of lesson from the other two
1,she does not know what to do with what she has and is ready to accept and appreciate the way her character,she 's always looking to be in love and she is so cute that it is just as good as hers
1,this movie is so boring and unbelievable that,this is a movie you can love
1,king 's performance is quite wooden as the villain,king 's character is n't really that interesting and he
1,i saw this as a kid and i laughed so much that there were,i would recommend this movie if you really want a fun scary movie
1,this was probably one of those movies,this is a must watch movie
1,your wife 's family should be ashamed to see this film on the dvd,your favorite character in the world is a little more interesting for the audience
1,i am not surprised that this show has been aired and released,i have n't seen any bad films so far i 've watched the
1,it 's not a very bad film though its very predictable but it 's still good to see the rest and if u can,it 's a movie that should be seen because they just had a good time and had to leave for a bit longer
1,mitchell is a very young woman who has,mitchell is the first of the three
1,the movie was made in the wake room of all of this as well as many great movies and the music score and the performances of both actors and actresses,the cast are pretty good the script by nikhil fisher 's character from a first novel of his novel was a classic but the performances were very poor as was the
1,how can a character like that of a young woman be,how many people do have a problem with this movie
1,this movie could n't possibly be considered,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,most of you are familiar by that you get it right,most notable scenes of people who have been on an island in
1,that scene is quite funny and has a funny,that said the plot is somewhat too contrived
1,perhaps the director could have been just a little too much to handle a movie that has been made at first,perhaps a lot of people would like to know but if you think the movie is an accurate depiction that 's a
1,it 's like watching an episode of the xfiles,it 's also a film to look for in a
1,save yourself the time avoid it,save yourself no matter your time you
1,a real disappointment to any fan of a very good film in,a good movie that i would recommend watching out and enjoy
1,while this is not a great movie by the time it is done i am a sucker to revisit it,while this is not a good film the characters and situations were very real and very realistic and the ending was
1,over the course of the movie he is the leader and a hero of his life who becomes a part of the story and how,over all it 's a pretty bad bad movie that 's probably only the worst possible excuse for an actor i 've ever met
1,we 're supposed that it 's a bad movie and it is not,we do not see the whole scene of the film in which the two
1,this is a true classic and it 's definitely not for everyone but i do n't recommend watching it,this movie shows some kind of acting ability from the first time we see her in the role
1,i could n't imagine how many movies made in their career i felt compelled by the end to see,i 've seen this movie in a month and then it is available in a collection of dvd 's and
1,those who saw it loved it i found it to not look like it might have been in the film,those who think that these movies do not get a chance and are just not as good and better than this
1,the ending is the best of the entire movie,the story is about some young girl who marries her
1,it 's not as good a film today it is a masterpiece of its type from,it 's like watching someone trying to escape an ancient family from a haunted house
1,also the plot and the film has a lot of action and a good time,also as a movie about the famous battle between dr king the man and his wife
1,nearly every action movie clich ever,nearly every scene is set in a
1,but if that 's the best movie you 've ever seen this,but this is where it fails and is ultimately the same
1,maybe they could have had a better script,maybe because they 're the best ever since sliced
1,she has a lovely woman who has the exact same body,she also is very good as the mother of the mother
1,and then he meets a very untalented girl at the school where,and i think the ending i do not want my own
1,but then when i saw a film in the cinema that was more than just a cheap remake of the film it 's also very entertaining,but that is one thing that is a little overdone in the context that he is not in his own life and in some scenes he has
1,i saw this film when its release was a great hit from the 2005 film theatre,i was very surprised by the way these characters treated each other their friendship and loneliness
1,in other words this was so awful that it made a few,in the end it 's one more time than the end
1,she did n't really do it for anything but,she also had no place in the movie
1,not for you and you can only find someone to,not a bad film but i still ca all
1,the only thing i can remember is how the heck could the director know what he was looking for,the director has an eye for the camera in his scenes where he gets his hand cut by one bullet
1,the film is just so awful that it is laughable,the characters were the biggest and most sympathetic part of the
1,and i am sure the audience will laugh,and there was so many plot holes
1,no one has done the same,no matter how many times a guy
1,some of the dialogue was bad,some parts are too bad that the
1,i have watched the show numerous times,i do believe that it should get any
1,arthur has a lot of fun to work on as a person in real life,arthur is in my top 5 favourite movies but i do think he was the only
1,it 's not a movie where the movie is not the worst,it was made for that i thought it would be the same as
1,i was n't expecting any of the actors to be such a good guy and the acting was,i do think he had no idea that this was made by one hundred or a fan
1,oscar madison plays a role that was in his last appearance of the,oscar wilde 's performance was great and he did a good performance
1,spoilers ahead it 's not an action movie but it is definitely the right movie to keep you interested for some reason,spoilers below the only thing that saves the show and the ending of this episode are so lame that it just comes out
1,anne and his wife 's friends are a young,anne reid is a revelation as the movie
1,basically you ca n't even get to this point in this movie,basically you can take your eyes off the screen with a little bit
1,the film begins in a small town,the movie is very slow boring
1,two of us have a lot of fun to get this movie because,two thumbs up on her and let him go back to her
1,ms moore also has a cameo as a young woman who has no reason,ms reed and his son are the only ones who can make their own life
1,at first i had to see this in theaters in the late,at that he does n't really have that in his heart
1,ok now he just is n't right and he just does not want a reason,ok i 've seen worse movies by far but this is a bad one
1,otherwise the film was quite disappointing with the main story and its not much special features,otherwise the movie was a bit too long and the end was way beyond that of the
1,dino a great man in the first part is a great film for the kids who are willing to pay attention to the movie because the movie has a,dino 's brother has the best and brunt of a good guy in the book and is n't as good as she would come out of her home
1,it 's the same movie that was,it 's not a big waste
1,i love watching people getting beaten up into the mix but the fact is that he is n't funny in a few moments,i had no idea how it would ever end but i did not have to worry that this was a movie about a killer
1,melissa is a true witch who is constantly being swept away from another family and when she is forced by a mother who she is,melissa does n't have to be one of us at the end of her life and she 's just a bit too much talking
1,what a great combination of comedy romance,what a waste as a comedy
1,but this episode is not for everyone,but there are n't too many things to
1,my favourite character ever came in a movie,my first impression about seeing this movie is that
1,i was surprised that this sequel was still in the top 10 series,i do n't know what the budget for films should have been but the
1,there is no real plot and the acting in any case makes the movie even stronger,there is no real story to be taken from and that 's what the plot did in
1,they were to have something of the power rangers from the movie that made the,they were not in the same league and they had a lot more money
1,in the case the story is very well developed,in fact it 's a bit odd to see a
1,cut to the camera was a bit of one of those actors and they,cut off of that one which is just a bit of a letdown
1,there 's not a single scene where we get to watch this movie the characters are so real and the acting even worse,there are n't many great shots as the two protagonists walk through one of their very high and very very very very very deep
1,as it has done this kind of thing comes up with a real problem with what is,as for this movie it looks like a movie made up from some cheap action thriller
1,after watching this episode i decided to pick it up,after seeing the last 30 min of what happened as the
1,it is a film in which the characters are presented as different actors,it really makes you think you have to have seen a couple thousand times
1,perhaps there was more to it than this movie,perhaps the reason to be in that movie is the
1,thought of the story as a whole and it 's all about life,thought the film 's title would have been much better had it had a
1,i am ashamed to say that the ending is a lot less ambiguous and that 's the point,i just love to make fun movies that make me think that a movie has never made it to
1,this film just does nothing for you and i have not yet found out about it and how all the actors have done it,this is a real gem a great movie and a fantastic one and should be seen by anyone looking at a different picture
1,mantee was so funny to me so much more than he seemed in the early 80 another,mantee is so great to watch this guy and the whole thing becomes a real delight
1,if you like these movies you will love the one where there 's a lot in this,if that were n't enough there is a good deal to be sure for the plot
1,not only do i enjoy movies so much but there is,not even that i think it is really really good
1,the film is just about a bunch trying not to get into the pants and the camera,the movie has a great cast with a few of the most notable cast of characters
1,shootouts are the main character but that 's all there is,shootouts are often pretty dull but not much else but a very
1,the story and characters are interesting but,the ending is n't a problem
1,what a waste of two hours and 79 minutes with this slop,what a waste of time and money that the filmmakers did n't make
1,unfortunately i ca n't describe how bad it is and it has the most annoying soundtrack i saw,unfortunately it is a poor excuse to show the real world of the human population of the film to
1,it seems that the people that made this film wanted a refund at least once they,it is an intelligent film of an honest world of women in a rural world
1,the film is very well worth checking in to watch,the acting and script was a bit slow but the story
1,for those who have n't seen it i think i would,for this film the actors are a bit different though
1,310 the first half of the movie is very good but the characters are just not,310 for you and i love the fact they 've made another film like it
1,that 's because of the quality of the story,that 's what this movie would have been
1,george lucas 's film is a brilliant movie about life,george raft was wonderful and he was so believable
1,spoilers warning i must admit it i can appreciate a lot but it is still good to see and hear a lot more,spoilers ahead there have been some good movies lately this one takes the first half of the movie and makes it a very entertaining
1,but in a scene they are just not interesting,but the story of this woman is a great one
1,the actors in a better tomorrow the,the movie is n't exactly great
1,michele is one of the best characters i have ever seen,michele is so much that it 's difficult for us to get
1,as far as i'm concerned this is a really bad,as to a plot you 'll never hear again
1,and the music is just horrible,and this is where his eyes begin
1,tori spelling is excellent and the movie is a joy,tori grahame is the best in the whole cast
1,as to the rest they all get a lot more depth from each other than,as a whole i will say i do have a fondness for this movie
1,they have the right mix of action,they even do n't have it
1,mr de sade was one hell of an actor,mr hyde is an excellent character actor he does a
1,from the moment the film is told we 're introduced to a couple of scenes of the film which are n't really funny,from the moment you get to a point to the movie you just feel sorry to have a movie of it but not even
1,philip seymour jones gives his character a real talent but that is what,philip 's acting talent is also the best performance of the film
1,it is a great deal of action,it 's hard to believe that she was
1,anyway this movie is a perfect piece for a movie but i just,anyway the movie takes us into the life of the main character
1,it is hard that the filmmakers did n't want the audiences to be,it is n't just too bad but there is nothing new here
1,it is the ultimate story of an assassination investigation between the law and president 's wife,it 's really not that great to do that much but it really makes up its own
1,i 've always thought of a good,i love that the movie works
1,gee i 'll never forget it i guess but not before sunrise,gee this movie was funny but the main character and a good guy
1,this is a great movie in a small budget that is a little over the place but i,this movie is so boring i actually felt like the story was made out of a loop
1,true its not as bad as i 'd seen in the theater but the first time you see how it was released theatrically made the first one look great and,true that it is the first film to have a child in a theater where people are not going to make a movie about the evils of their relationship
1,however it never seemed to be a,however it 's still pretty funny
1,most likely the movie is just plain dull that makes it hard to understand,most of the other actors are excellent but none of the supporting players are outstanding
1,stewart is an excellent choice for the role of his career which leads him back to the future,stewart is great in his role but i do n't know he is n't a star and i ca
1,lovely in the sense that it is a,lovely and touching is an excellent film
1,the movie is quite enjoyable and has the best elements of the film,the plot of the movie is the same as one of the main characters
1,the story is n't that bad the acting was horrible the directing is horrible the,the script of this story involves two young adults trying to find new york
1,just before they could use the film 's budget i wonder who could blame this crap,just when you think that the movie will be as good if you like this you are
1,the acting is not as bad as you 've read,the film has been a major success for all
1,the story involves a man trying to steal his wife 's life of his father,the whole thing seems contrived and it does n't take too many elements from it
1,so it was all time and i felt,so do we do n't get it
1,this is one big disappointment after an accident with two men getting together,this movie is a complete mess with a capital on the cover
1,that the film has a very high rating on this movie is that if i was the type of guy that i am in the mood for and not a film i think there are too many of my,that 's where the story gets going and you get something very good going on in which you ca n't figure out if the killer should n't be the good guy or the villain or the killer snowman
1,there was n't a bad link between the two,there also was a reason for that to be a
1,everyone in this movie was just plain stupid,everyone who watches this movie will see it just
1,that 's why i watched it to death,that is not only my favorite but to make
1,this movie shows the potential that it could have been,this is the kind that a movie that is a disgrace
1,there was a bit too dark and unnecessary in their scenes that made it hard to watch and,there are some hilarious scenes but there 's not enough material to pull a movie like that
1,i would n't want to waste 90 minutes at the cinema,i would recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of
1,i love this movie because it made me a fan,i ca n't see anyone liking a movie like in this
1,the actors seem real to life and,the plot is simple at best
1,given a budget by a friend i would give a rating of 3 and a half of the lowest rating and generous rating of 610,given the fact he was just another woman i could have had a soft side and was a pretty good dancer who would love it
1,be warned of that the movie is set up on a big island and has an important relationship with the beautiful lady,be forewarned the film was so bad that i had to stop watching the entire movie to get my hands on my dvd
1,this is the movie 's only message,this makes for an easy time in my
1,the characters in this film are very real,the plot is ridiculous and not believable
1,other than that it was really funny,other movies were made for those that like
1,if you 've never seen that one i suggest you go watch this,if you like films like the ring you 'll know you should
1,helped by his mother in the film he had become a writer 's dream of an abusive,helped out for this film 's story it did n't even get me started with it
1,his mother is also engaged in their own and he wants to kill herself,his character is a stereotype of a man with his wife and a child in
1,other actors do the best they could with a good script or direction,other aspects i have n't bothered but are to have just finished watching the
1,how did the cops find in that,how many times have we heard of the
1,i think this movie is very good,i am not the type of person this
1,it is the type of story you need a viewer to see,it 's like something of a rip out of a classic
1,it 's not even worth it for laughs and is a,it was a big waste to make one of disney
1,she is a talented actress and actress who can act in this piece,she 's not a bad actress she is pretty annoying though she does n't
1,he 's not one of the greats,he is also in the movie and is
1,franciscus as a young girl who gets married for her husband but has,franciscus plays the mother who has the chance of becoming a vampire
1,some of the scenes in the film were too short and for,some very interesting acting and a great deal to the plot
1,the movie is a real pleasure to watch,the story is set out for the girl to
1,while the cast were great and i had seen the movie on vhs and saw them in the theater i was very impressed,while in the latter and years he was a little too young to be considered too violent to the world of war so his
1,then the movie opens with three of a few of the actors running and we hear about the film on the screen and,then it goes with a lot too much and the humor seems like something from a stage play with no real plot
1,from one of the worst endings i 've ever seen,from a point on the story is a mess
1,regrettably the movie is not so much of it and it 's an insult,regrettably a little too talky for my liking though it 's really just the story
1,the acting was ok but i did n't like it so much i could n't help feeling it was a bad,the actors were very bad but all i could do was laugh in this movie as the movie went on
1,the story is n't very original and there 's even a few twists and turns,the only thing missing is the story the plot is very very simple and the plot
1,steven bauer did a superb job as the evil and unfeeling father of the family of his own,steven 's character was killed by a serial killer who was supposed at her place in this movie
1,personally i think this could be a good movie,personally i did enjoy watching the show the acting and
1,bookstore 's new groove is now one the best and greatest television show i,bookstore fever and the city were made of a few more years ago
1,the film starts out pretty well with the two,the film is one of the very best
1,joe 's character is not the kind,joe is a master of the underworld and
1,she also shows her range as she tries to seduce her,she 's always good for her part but i just got it
1,is this the same old film,is this because it 's so hard
1,in the end it is the most entertaining,in addition in the end you can never see
1,kevin spacey is in his element here and you can understand his character as he is in the book,kevin spacey as the villain and he looks like he 's wearing some clothes as the camouflage of him is
1,each character was a stereotype from the beginning to the last,each and every one of them was a stereotype and the people
1,apparently the filmmakers and producers of films like this should also not,apparently this is a great movie for those who enjoy seeing
1,however there 's also a lot more to the film than it is which makes it a bad film but,however they had to deal on to the point that it was the worst thing on the whole screen
1,reluctantly they get to be married by another woman who is now an alcoholic woman and they are all too busy to,reluctantly he gets to know a lot about his wife 's murder but does n't want to take him away from
1,i ca n't remember how many of the jokes were funny,i just found it impossible to believe it was such
1,and i really enjoy the film,and as for it 's a very
1,could n't have had more to say to,could they not be a bit prejudiced
1,do n't waste my 1 or 2 minutes to buy this film,do not be put off by a complete lack of action
1,for my money back in the days of being a movie about a young couple,for me it is an excellent film which it 's worth your life of
1,do n't look to this movie,do n't be surprised by the movie
1,grab it if you are a hardcore movie goer,grab in the background and you have to endure this
1,when the movie 's end the ending is as unexpected and unexpected as it gets,when he gets back in a bus he runs afoul of the group of people who
1,this film also stars gene connery and a woman who had,this movie is a total waste of your money time
1,god bless me and my roommate and the movie and the movie for its own,god i thought this film was awesome but the main focus was on that
1,i'm pretty sure that this could be a great show,i'm amazed that this was made by a wider audience so
1,thank god i never seen this film,thank god she did n't make a movie
1,my wife and this show are all very good,my favourite character was the old guy who has always
1,nolte plays the character in the first,nolte is one fine action star
1,best film ever made in the world is one of the best comedies that have made my head drop the,best of all was a nice movie that is so entertaining that the viewer has not seen the film
1,kristin has never been a fan but she does n't do it like she is,kristin 's character 's reaction to events is so stupid that you can hardly imagine any
1,actually it 's quite obvious that the,actually the film was very boring
1,the characters do n't have a shred on their personality,the film is a great deal more of a comedy
1,so if you 're a true fan and the people who have n't read this do,so the plot has to be the dumbest thing that this movie has ever conjured
1,if this guy 's daughter had a mental disorder she was dead but in a different,if the show did n't take itself a bit too long then let it be
1,he also had to contend with the two,he 's a master of a great life and
1,worth watching if your going to keep,worth seeing just as a child
1,i have seen it several times it 's still worth it because it was filmed in color for,i was not surprised to see this movie in the 80 minutes to the film 's conclusion
1,the first 15 minutes or so are the worst i have read and,the story is pretty bad but the movie never really takes place
1,however i do believe that many women in the audience could have been a little more interested that the woman in fact did not,however after seeing this film for a while i could not believe i had been in a theater and had n't experienced it as a
1,zhang maltin is an excellent actor but he did n't make films so,zhang mitchell does so much in the way the cast are perfect
1,after all there are some pretty good actors like the,after all a good movie that everyone should watch
1,it 's also an odd story of a young man who falls prey a new,it seems that i 've seen a movie which is n't a bad idea
1,in the end the main antagonist is too stupid to be too funny,in fact the best in the original movie was the one that i watched
1,if you have any doubts about the subject matter why did n't they just try to cram an iq into the movie with a story to kill,if you have n't read the novel you probably wo to like the film version but if you are to be mistaken for a good adaptation and a
1,how did the producers know how funny this movie,how did i see such a rotten show
1,scott bakula as the man who had to deal with the idea was the perfect person he,scott 's performance was good but he did not have any screen charisma as the villain
1,if you want to know who the killer has really happened you will have more fun watching this,if it 's on tv or video i have to do my little share as a movie
1,greg araki does have the good luck of being a man with this film he 's very funny and makes the whole thing unique,greg kinnear is very good but his portrayal is a bit inconsistent for anyone who loves horror movies because this one is n't
1,roy rogers has a great performance for the role but he plays,roy scheider plays a man with a soft spot on life
1,duryea was a big surprise to me,duryea and his friend are just as believable
1,there are some funny scenes but there is no real plot that has no meaning or suspense whatsoever to make a very,there 's some nice action scenes and great performances by all involved but the script and the script are not good
1,however he 's not as good as some of the others,however i am not that hard to find much to laugh at
1,the only reason this movie has to rank as one,the movie was a waste of time on film
1,i do not know what the director 's previous reviewer has been thinking,i have been looking for a few movies in that i do n't know
1,douglas 's character seems so forced he tries to convince himself,douglas fairbanks is good but the script lacks any kind
1,sadly the film 's sole weakness in the end comes,sadly the story is pretty standard for the most
1,if one has a photogenic film buff it does n't get me wrong,if you have n't read this review please give the movie points
1,by the last 10 seconds in its first hour of the film i felt that i did n't get bored,by the end of the film there was not one moment or retrospect that any of the characters could ever talk
1,granted it has nothing but a movie,granted this is a great movie
1,the film is filled throughout as a result of that film and that,the acting is very good but the plot is terrible at first
1,brett is a complete cipher with the story of a young man and a family,brett mcclure looks great here as the lead character he was a pretty cool actor but
1,also the film has a rather depressing soundtrack,also this is not even one movie
1,the director 's chair on the wall in a way that makes this one of the best satires,the plot line of the film is very thin and the acting performances are generally quite good
1,i am glad you did n't get it and,i had a great time watching this film
1,rich and handsome mr lincoln has an unusual role in this,rich people were killed or killed by a giant killer
1,and the plot is n't a big let down,and i do n't know what i really liked about
1,angelopoulos 's film is a film of a sort,angelopoulos 's character is a stereotype from the first film
1,the acting the characters the direction and everything just makes you feel like the film 's end was just,the main idea of the game is how bad it was but i was still in the mood
1,the director is obviously trying too much and it does n't seem as to be an explicit statement of any sort of film or even the slightest glimmer of its,the acting was n't great it just left me wanting to see what happened next but it was a real bore in the last few seconds of the flick
1,it 's not a bad movie either it 's the only film in the genre where you could not even get a sense of what it is supposed to really get,it 's a shame he 's a great actor and he manages to give an awesome portrayal of the contradictions that he brings back to his work and his talents for the
1,at times the film resembles a great drama and its story,at one time in my life he said that this movie was
1,and why did they get so little to do with it,and the ending was as if the writer was trying too
1,spoiler ahead i was n't expecting much and i would rather watch paint dry,spoiler ahead this movie has some redeeming qualities and i think that it does make
1,charlie is not a gay man in the us when his character in the movie has been killed by the white,charlie sheen was so convincing but i did not feel that i was in the film for the entire movie
1,overall the movie is a good watch,overall the film is a complete waste
1,david lean as usual is also very funny,david lynch has the power and ability that he
1,the characters have depth to them,the first two films of the series
1,i think that 's why this movie has n't been released,i was so bored when this was being filmed and the actors
1,sure there are some good moments but the rest is a bit overlong to be anything more than a movie,sure the acting was good but the movie is n't good enough to be enjoyable but that 's all i have
1,welcome for the film to work and you will find yourself to watch it and decide if not to be entertained,welcome to the director of the film the most obvious aspect of this movie was the fact there was no suspense in
1,successful and i suppose i 've got,successful acting is n't the case
1,beating up a group member with the aid of jack,beating up the house the movie has been released to theaters
1,i ca n't believe this waste of money and money,i saw this movie at a high rate movie festival and
1,it has a lot going for it but in the end,it 's a fun movie to see and laugh at
1,it 's not that he was an,it 's not just a movie
1,she did n't even bother to go,she is in the house and she goes
1,i'm going for more info i think,i'm not a horror fan because i was
1,every character in their movie is likable except for its own sake,every time i see this film i still feel like i would have
1,i do not know how to do so,i could 've done without any redeeming features
1,young woman and his mother are in love,young women are n't the only thing they do
1,i'm sure they could make it out in the movie theaters but i am glad,i'm glad that there is a lot more to be made about this movie
1,then the scene shows the man 's face and how the,then again the movie is just too bad to watch
1,the characters are so bad it seems like every other scene in the movie,the acting was horrible and the writing is atrocious the characters who really do n't
1,meantime the film turns out that the characters are,meantime i was n't convinced of the film
1,although the film is dated and the acting is n't bad either way the rest of it is,although i loved this movie it was so bad it 's funny to begin off the plot
1,this movie had nothing to recommend it and was a great film i really recommend it,this is what we need for a film and it shows us a few times
1,i am amazed that the producers did n't show a more explicit film with such a gruesome and morbid approach to,i think that the director should have stayed with the director because he made the movie to an entertaining pace
1,i have n't seen it since it was released on dvd,i was hoping to laugh but when i saw the trailer i
1,when the film opens we have that in spades,when it is n't clear that there are a bunch
1,it 's one of the most underrated movies,it was n't very hard to say
1,then there was some pretty obvious scenes with a few scenes of a,then he gets to the bottom that he is actually a werewolf
1,2 the character was a stupid ass,2 i have no idea what he has
1,go watch the movie with the commentary if there is ever a plot of this movie,go see the film or the real life if you like this type to watch
1,they are the main characters here,they do n't have any luck but
1,similarly a little bitty of its own,similarly a series in the us has fallen
1,this film is a true masterpiece in a book,this should 've gone straight into all the movies
1,the cast are great for the best and it is worth noting how a movie like the other movies in that country where you,the characters were not as believable as the main characters or were it to a real plot the whole idea of this one
1,you have the same sort and ps1,you 'll see the similarities between the original
1,the main characters are in this one,the actors themselves are n't even that good
1,despite the fact that this does n't make for very good use at all it was the first,despite having the film that it had to offer a few points the movie is pretty good
1,we can see some great talent for the film and the actors,we were just laughing at the tv show and we were n't even
1,well i ca n't remember much of the story except the characters who seem to be very unlikable and annoying and are not very believable,well the director 's intent on being in the book is the main point where the audience sees the movie as a real person in it
1,she is a beautiful little girl who 's not afraid to be taken,she plays this part beautifully and she does a very convincing acting
1,think to say the best of my favorite line in the film is when he asks the phone store,think of the film as a comedy it 's a shame it 's just not worth a rental
1,swift has done a lot better but the best thing in this movie is his lack in the script,swift is a master film maker as well but he could have taken a long time to make a documentary
1,the ending is very satisfying and it,the movie starts off ok enough
1,i do think that this kind would change the movie as a,i had never heard anything about that before seeing this movie
1,and as the series progresses they are both good too and we have the main actors who are,and then the guy who dies the whole ordeal of being kidnapped and raped a few people
1,also starring joan hickson in this film,also the ending in the final showdown is
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is no masterpiece but its just
1,there 's no question that the film,there 's also an intriguing ending
1,there are some funny moments in here but the film,there is also some nice shots of the wtc
1,when the police are n't quite sure what happened to her i do n't know if they 'll be able on to the house or why he does it,when i heard the book i wanted to see what was going on and i was really shocked by the plot line but what it seemed did was n't explained
1,even though the story has a bunch of clichs the plot was really bad,even though the action is somewhat different than it is it has the most memorable
1,nick nolte was great his character is so real,nick nolte is perfect as one 's sweetheart
1,overall this film had a lot of action,overall the movie is worth the watch
1,gauri has also the most difficult in a film she 's not a great singer as she has her,gauri the film 's only star cast is an excellent and convincing performance by both men and women
1,chanwook park has a lot but the,chanwook steiger 's acting is great
1,it 's the best film ever created,it 's the exact same kind
1,i have yet never heard anything about,i did not like the movie
1,now that i am watching this movie i 'll stop my pants out if it is n't,now i would n't go too far for my friend to give this movie another ten for the
1,i do n't like the movie i really wanted my son or sister to go back,i have to admit i hated it but it is a complete bore to see
1,however in a world where the world 's greatest athlete is,however they do n't really seem like a normal person
1,far far from that one of the best ones of the year 2000 was the most beautiful thing i have heard on the big screen,far more entertaining than the typical slasher movies of this era and with more plot than most modern hollywood films i was expecting a lot from
1,i would n't have to disagree that,i was in my early 20s
1,the plot seems to have a certain point as,the plot is simple but not too bad
1,thanksgiving is a very good film but i would advise to all,thanksgiving alone in its own world is a very good movie
1,i love the way the movie starts to drag and the actors are quite real,i really wish there was a more subtle audience who would have loved watching the film
1,there are a couple of memorable moments but you wo n't get to see them either,there was n't one line in this film that could possibly redeem the bad acting it was
1,the story has some funny moments,the first half of it has a
1,charles durning is a fine actor and i can see how this is going to rank,charles durning played a man in a long running gag in the early 90 's
1,then he goes to the town,then to add that this film is
1,i 've never seen her before but the only thing she has on this film,i ca n't stress the actors who are n't talented performers in this movie
1,of course the real life of this film is that it is n't even,of interest the script is quite good with some familiar and clever characters
1,i have no idea what it meant,i was very disappointed by this film
1,i had not read the book i watched it as,i have to admit i have seen worse things
1,this is what makes movies so good,this film is so bad it is bad
1,its not as good as the novel but not,its not even so bad it 's good'
1,the story is simple enough but the plot is a very thin one which is n't as,the movie is filled at a very slow ending that really does n't work very long
1,but that is all i love about this one that is n't bad,but the best of all is the script in which the two are written
1,the director 's cut of a dvd cover was also in dolby color as well,the story is simple as hell it is a bit of boring and boring
1,is it an insult to any film in hollywood that was made by the producer in such a disgraceful and implausible,is it the truth a time travel to an island that has n't got an education and a little girl
1,this is probably the worst film i have come across this year,this is a movie you need a wider audience for it 's very
1,i ca n't imagine a good film making this one to be the worst movie ever,i love it when you watch the movie and you know how good that 's what i
1,her father and uncle have a mutual,her character is the worst ever
1,but in the end i was just looking for the movie that would have been much more interesting if a better cast would have been given their characters with the story in the movie and the director and the writers,but the real star of its film was its short lived sequence with its eerily ambiguous portrayal as the director 's final collaboration of the characters and their interactions between the main characters and the two main characters and it is
1,if it was n't for the fact that the film was filmed as it,if there were any more about this movie it would be the first
1,not to mention that the film 's,not that i did anything wrong
1,i was n't able in that one,i do n't care how many people in
1,the film is set in the us when the partition of mexico,the actors are so poor they 're all good caricatures but they were
1,knowing it is a movie in general and not a single mother can watch the,knowing how this is about life and how it will be a good idea
1,ok that 's a real shame,ok it was n't a very good
1,through this film we 're not even a fan of the character of the protagonist he 's not even the hero at all it 's just so ridiculous you 'll probably be rooting,through the years the film was made with more of the highest profile of the first films in the history and the one that has to do is a very nice take
1,i do think that the story itself was interesting and i found it hard for me for some people to be entertained by the plot twists and turns of my head,i saw this show on tv at the time and was still amused by that movie and i thought i 'd give it another one star but this film is horrible
1,this movie is no more than a film designed to entertain the audience,this movie has a decent premise and that is about it the way this
1,paul lukas plays the young man with a penchant for accuracy,paul rudd does a pretty cool role as the main character
1,i am not a person that appreciates the movies of the holocaust,i did n't have any expectations about this show in that it seems
1,but it 's a good movie,but it does n't even look as
1,of all things the acting is great,of the many of you and my favorites
1,i could n't stand my head,i would not recommend this film to
1,while most horror buffs are n't interested in seeing this film you are looking for a film,while it certainly did not work on a level of its own it 's quite enjoyable
1,one might expect that a movie from an audience like that would be made to have a chance to,one of the many of the series has an emmy on the characters and the dialogue is stilted
1,although there is nothing wrong with the music it 's pretty fun in its presentation of the,although i was really surprised by the amount i 've seen this is an excellent film
1,there is no story no plot and the whole movie just seems like it had,there is no such action in this movie and i did n't get bored
1,charlton jovi is an extremely talented actor,charlton heston is also a nice actor but
1,i love horror films and horror movies like this and the,i do not want him in this movie for everyone
1,while i do n't find that it is a good movie it 's still entertaining,while it was not meant to appeal to the audiences with a sense the film still
1,now i know this film is about the same subject with english subtitles but the film does n't have much to recommend or,now if you 're a sucker or fan you are very surprised in a horror film that will make many viewers uncomfortable
1,on that level i would be like this one to be able back home from the film,on the other end this could be a good movie and a real shame that it took the
1,my favorite parts of the movie are the ones where it 's in an old building of the water and,my favorite scene is when she meets the beautiful lady and the mother of his son and his friends
1,while the main story is a very good and sometimes aboveaverage book it is a very enjoyable film,while the original was n't a complete waste of film making i was still able to suspend disbelief
1,the story itself had no real impact in my eyes and the acting was just plain awful even at,the music is a little dated as well but the story is not too bad and the acting
1,when this comes out you 're wondering,when the two leads have a chance to
1,the movie is a masterpiece that will please fans of horror movies and the most important to the collection genre of the 1940s,the director obviously was looking for some money to try his hand at making this and he was just making another movie
1,it 's a film that has some funny moments but is still enjoyable,it seems that there 's an old person named the one who wants his
1,the only reason i watched it was for a few scenes in an elevator,the plot is simple the dialog is n't the best thing about it
1,i had a very high hopes of watching this film,i was able to see that this movie was a lot
1,he is a fine man who knows the,he has his own way of life
1,it 's not so bad it 's good just so bad that there,it 's not so bad it is good and it 's good
1,still it is the first and best of a trilogy,still the film makes one wonder how anyone who has any
1,do you think that he 's the best he can come up with when we need to do it on the outside,do n't be fooled by some reviews that do not say that 's a spoiler but the film does contain one of the
1,this movie is definitely not the type,this is the worst film i have ever
1,it 's not a good movie but it 's not,it 's not even a movie it is one big waste
1,i do think he should have given the movie a more realistic and truthful,i am so disappointed to find that this film is a total failure
1,after the film 's climax i thought it had merit,after the first 15 mins i went to the video store
1,perhaps that was not why i wanted to see this movie,perhaps they do not have the money for their production company
1,no it is a real movie but it 's still a,no one can replace anyone with a lick of charisma
1,the only thing that saved this movie was the music and the dancing with all the scenes in which the entire movie was shot and how,the acting is good but the script is so flat and contrived that you can almost hear the scene where the camera just sits there
1,different to the first three films and a,different and more successful in any ways
1,duke is a good character though the movie 's hero who is a big city hunter,duke played by james garner is the title character with the title of a movie
1,i ca all agree with the critics comments,i love the soundtrack of the music
1,have you ever seen a film you,have you seen the movie beforehand
1,by the time it was released it seemed very rushed and very poorly done the first half hour of,by watching this movie you are a fan of the movie and the whole time of the show
1,s it was that bad as it was on the screen,s wife in the other one in the film has a very
1,this is a pretty good film for the first ten min and it is definitely not,this is the first film i 've watched that i think is a perfect place to live
1,still though he and the film have a very enjoyable,still it makes a lot less fun to watch
1,i 've seen thousands of tv programmes in my,i do like that in the first movie
1,four hours of nothing of any importance is that this is the type,four friends are also the most powerful and most of our lives
1,considering my expectations in the same year it 's been made clear i am watching another movie in,considering his other works are to die hard is the worst thing i 've heard of it
1,any of it is a bit more interesting than in most of the other comments,any movie that can be made in a similar to the original was a major mistake
1,indeed it was very difficult to believe,indeed the movie is pretty bad
1,she 's just another stupid character to her side,she is not a very attractive actress in fact it
1,every time a director of the original film ended it could n't be as bad,every single person seems so much like an idiot 's wife and daughter 's daughter who
1,as for a bunch called old fashioned music it was,as a viewer this movie was very very good
1,sometimes i am trying to get a little more of what happens,sometimes it was made for tv viewing but it did n't
1,mclaglen 's performance was so poor that i had to stop at my local library,mclaglen is one of those who have a knack for his career and is not just
1,it is an important film to see that it is a masterpiece of mine but with some really amazing scenes,it 's like a documentary of the real world in which a film takes itself too far too seriously
1,errol flynn plays a young gangster named sam,errol flynn is in for good as he gets
1,and the movie is one of those movies where a man is n't only a girl with a very poor girl a boy who likes women,and for the most of the two guys who actually have a real problem with the movie i guess it 's not worth the effort
1,i just saw a couple of episodes of this show which had me laughing my eyes off for a while when the film,i love to think about all the violence and sexual abuse in the entire family that i am afraid it 's not
1,the film 's title says it all the,the movie opens in a middle class
1,so many great performances are wasted in the movie and their roles that i have no interest in,so in any event there is no real reason to do the same except that it 's the one
1,leading lady and two sisters are pretty good,leading lady is a bit of an actress and
1,this is just another movie which i have not seen so far as an actress or even the actors,this is definitely worth a look as the worst of the year and there has no tension to speak of
1,when you look for a bit of it and you can see the whole,when they talk on the phone they decide to kill people and try
1,to be honest it does n't help matters to the original,to me it would only be more like a film to make
1,the story of a young boy who lives in a small provincial rural,the characters seem shallow they are in the least annoying they are
1,the first 30 minutes i found myself wondering about it was n't,the only other positive element was how the movie was made
1,well it seems like a bad idea,well you can see the same things that
1,and if this movie were about a group they 'd have done,and he 's a real trooper with some great action sequences
1,perhaps it was because it was filmed in the us,perhaps he 's got a good job for doing this but
1,i am amazed that the filmmakers could n't write a review for it,i ca all think it 's a good thing for a good movie
1,here 's where i saw it a couple years ago,here 's another of the worst i 've seen of this
1,from a technical standpoint this is n't an accurate picture,from what we do consider the story the only thing that
1,i would n't even go with the wind that i was n't,i saw this yesterday on the bbc network at a screening
1,the only saving the name of the dvd was the,the acting is poor and the actors seem stiff
1,the characters and dialogue were flat to the extreme,the story was really weak and boring the directing was
1,maybe i should 've stayed awake and had some sense of closure,maybe she was n't going for a bit more but she does n't
1,in all honesty i found this to be a waste for an hour,in the end it 's a great movie that everyone can relate for to
1,but this movie does n't have it all as a bad film,but the film is full and i ca n't see the appeal behind
1,it was like being shot for someone who was just looking for a camera or a camera,it is very obvious that the entire time of this production was done so well and that they
1,all of the scenes which are really funny are the best,all it has is an amazing amount for the character
1,it was not so bad you just do n't laugh out,it has no suspense and a lot for the story
1,how many times have we seen this,how do you get so much wrong with
1,the acting as if all that was wrong with the character was just a big wimp,the story is n't very interesting the acting and plot are just plain bad and there 's
1,everything was great the characters the music and everything about this movie just sucked,everything in the film is pretty bad to the point that you will notice that
1,but the plot is so stupid it 's impossible to suspend belief,but as a whole it 's still very bad even if you think
1,his character is a real human and that all of them are real the way they are and how they go,his only real life is that it will get more interesting as his character goes after him and his family
1,but that 's not enough to hold a movie 's interest,but i have not seen a film like this since i have
1,this is a really cool movie,this is one of the few movies
1,when the bad guys finally get the bad job of killing the bad guys then they fight them down as though the,when he finally becomes a human lover he finds out that his son is the one and only a few years
1,a few other reviews i read here about this movie but i did not understand the fact that this movie flopped,a young woman named rachel is killed by a young girl who is taken by her father who has lost the daughter
1,i saw this in the theater after seeing the movie for the first 10 seconds and it 's,i have to agree it 's not a bad film but it is good at the best
1,the movie begins with the girl playing a stripper being raped by a group to a party,the film is also very well directed by robert de palma who wrote the screenplay for his own
1,i 've heard this as an act of movie for a very young generation and it 's difficult not to see the film for its own sake,i 've already got through the movie a couple times in the film and i'm surprised that these two movies are all based on the facts of such
1,you can only see it in a theater when it first aired to us,you see the guy who 's just the hero is n't the best one
1,what i found funny is that there is no suspense or suspense,what is the deal with the guy who was so funny
1,lois chiles is one hell of a good actor but as a person i can appreciate his role here for being a very bad man,lois chiles is the perfect choice for this role as a detective who goes through the trouble with his family to find his family
1,without the other films i have to mention that this is the most horrible movie i have seen,without a doubt this is a movie that will appeal to adults who do n't appreciate it
1,almost every time he 's about to kill himself he takes the gun from his arm and then is shot dead,almost everything from the first scene in the entire series is absolutely beautiful but is n't much of an effort
1,the only reason why i give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because at the time of it 's release it is a classic film,the director of course is the director who made the movie so bad that he just wanted the two leads to him and they all did a great job
1,i had to watch the movie to understand if i'm being a fan i would n't,i 've never thought to watch a film that is n't so bad that they do n't
1,i am very impressed that there is a story about the founding and the way the events unfold so that they can be changed in a certain context in the movie that is not to say it was an adaptation,i have read that he has been a major success as well as being a fan of his works so much so that when you see the real movie in the future he can become a good actor but that is
1,if i had a chance with the production for the,if you like bad movies then there are few
1,all that 's left and right is a bad movie,all the actors are excellent together and there were some pretty
1,starring david cronenberg and his family,starring in all of the above
1,finally the film goes beyond a mere comment of a movie that is not only that,finally this movie was so bad i ca ca n't believe i actually saw it
1,of the two people who have to have made this movie,of course the story is about an underground virus that is taken
1,the plot is interesting to me,the first half of the film is
1,i was surprised how much i loved this movie for the same reasons,i have not read so much of that it was n't meant as a
1,her character and her motivations are very interesting and her actions are quite clear but the script is really weak so the story is n't so great,her performance as a nun in a porn film in a row is a bit farfetched and that the main actor does not seem convincing but she still
1,she has not been a good choice for her,she had to get up to the point
1,let 's make the ultimate mistake of,let your kids watch this movie
1,ultimately this is not one of those films i 've seen with my friends,ultimately he 's a little too smart and too much and is really not the
1,if i could get my hands on this movie it would be a very good addition that,if your a fan and you are a big one then you wont get a film
1,the ending was as predictable as i would 've been a little too confused to be confused,the story is so simple the characters are very good the dialogue is funny and the music really
1,cruel intentions are all of the above,cruel intentions can only make its impact more
1,of course this film is n't as good as,of course there 's a few other flaws
1,the movie is filled by a complete and simple story about how to find the,the movie is based on a novel with a very short and complex plot
1,it 's an insult and to have seen the original the film 's creators is the only one with whom they can find this movie,it 's like watching someone 's wet dreams on their necks and trying hard but they never come back and it 's not a complete disaster
1,clich is an understatement as is the acting the writing and direction this is one of the greatest tv movies,clich 's in some cases and some of my favourite lines are that there 's nothing wrong with that
1,this was my favorite movie from the 80,this is a must for the family
1,the only good part of was the fact that it did not make sense to me,the plot was simple and predictable and the ending did n't make sense to the director
1,those who are familiar with it should really consider this story to the end as the action opens,those same old films are made so i 've always wondered if i had n't seen it
1,check out a cast of characters and their relationships that,check out the movie if you can catch it
1,the plot is about a married couple who decide to rob a mansion on a vacation,the whole family is portrayed like an idiot who was n't a man like that
1,he is a bit of a loser in the sense that this film is a big bore that 's why he 's,he was also a great actor and i was impressed with the way he played a role of a young gentleman
1,the ending is a little anticlimactic but,the film has a definite flaw
1,not just a very boring plot which would have turned out better,not much of a plot is the characters who are the same
1,here are the two leads the only one who is actually a good character is keitel whose performance is a good one,here is what he is in the story of the boy and the mother who has to stay on the island
1,grant and his two companions are a bunch to be honest and have never been more,grant 's character gets more screen time than anyone could do for his daughter and his lover
1,now this is one movie you 're just not gonna miss,now the plot is ok and the actors involved are very good
1,this is my first time for me,this film does n't come out of the
1,well it 's also a really funny movie,well i have to say this movie was great
1,being a big city enthusiast i saw the dvd on dvd and watched it again,being very smart to view an independent film like these films that are made for television
1,i was not expecting anything from this movie at times but it certainly was n't as bad as i thought it would be an enjoyable movie in parts and not just the first,i saw the preview on my birthday and it seemed as though it would 've made a very good movie that was so poorly done and had just a vague plot and i thought
1,because he has an alibi in the basement that is to be saved by the police,because of the fact that his film lacks a sense to the movie is one of the
1,theres a few good songs and i 'll bet that you can buy,theres some nice acting some nice special fx and a decent cast
1,death bed and its aftermath will haunt a,death bed was the first of three
1,jack lemmon 's character and the plot seemed to drag a lot to the extent of a movie but as an adaptation you just ca n't get into it and it does not,jack nicholson plays a young boy in a small town of new jersey who takes a job to be picked up by some of the worst characters he 's been sent to
1,at one time the movie does n't end until the ending,at the beginning of the movie where the girl is in a
1,my advice is if your looking at something that you should go see a movie about this,my son and i went to see this movie with my friends and they loved ones
1,sidney lumet directed the film and i 've been watching for years,sidney lumet is n't a good director he is no master filmmaker
1,then we got it all the way to,then again it 's not worth mentioning
1,stunningly beautiful and full with the same,stunningly photographed in its simplicity it is a
1,patricia carrol leigh and joan blondell are all excellent supporting actors in this,patricia bates was brilliant and i think she is quite good in some ways
1,this is probably one to watch for anyone interested in what it can be and is about to be touched,this film is a classic and it will always be remembered as one to see but its very enjoyable
1,but what we have to do about our culture are,but for me this is a must see film
1,the film is about a bunch of people who have been in the same apartment for some,the plot is so simple that you 'll wonder if the characters really did get real
1,the movie 's climax is a bit abrupt but the ending is so sad,the director of this film is the most versatile actress in hollywood as the most
1,yet it 's so much more to make it an entertaining piece for this director to be engrossed in the film,yet when they arrive at the house they start to lose his head of all the dead and when he returns home
1,one that i think is just an old movie,one can easily see the difference between the three in
1,the acting is ok as are the sets,the cast is all pretty good and a few
1,as for the direction it 's a nice touch,as far the worst movie i have ever seen the
1,typically a little too old for the,typically the characters are well developed
1,the cast were very good but the script was n't even close for the movie the viewer would care about the characters and situations,the first film has a very nice touch though the ending is so ridiculous and dull it actually undermines the movie 's spirit
1,all i can say about the other is that the,all of the characters in this are very funny
1,we can tell the director was making a very serious film in the editing department,we 're supposed as if we 'd never had seen any of those movies that were
1,good acting and a fine plot to give it such a good performance from the supporting,good performances and a good amount of action but you really are n't expecting them
1,it seems like an afterthought in every,it was the last of her
1,i was looking forward to seeing a documentary about the life and experience,i think that 's the only good thing i have on it
1,was he even in the movie,was she really made out alive
1,it does n't matter if that 's the point or it really is,it 's not funny enough it is almost funny in its own way with
1,audiences have commented on how awful the film really was when it came into being a film about a serial killer whose name in movies like the name of satan or frankenstein,audiences would be interested and in a film would be an improvement on their collective lives but the script is so bad that they could n't make it a good film
1,it is like a poor production of a stage play but that 's not what it was like,it was also an accident that was n't the slightest and the characters could not be developed by the
1,then they find the body of the girl at a local nightclub,then the story goes on to tell you that it is
1,all in all it is a very good movie,all the actors are excellent and there are parts that
1,rimmer is the kind of film which makes an appearance for,rimmer 's daughter is a very sweet woman of sorts
1,but the rest is a stinker and one that i think the only reason i'm going to watch the movie is because they do it,but if you want to see the worst action flick i 've seen in a long day it will be worth a look for an example
1,keanu reeves as the evil detective is not a good idea,keanu reeves has been in a much bigger career ever made and
1,the only drawback is the fact that it 's not a movie about a killer,the film is about two couples trying to save one of the best friends
1,as a fan of the film 's story i can find this film lacking in the usual clichs of the,as it is i did think that the actors would have had better luck and could have been better
1,the director is just trying to get us the right one for the audience,the acting was horrible as the two main actors were n't convincing the story was
1,a woman 's life is revealed in a film with a different character,a must watch for anyone who loves horror cinema movies and a great indie
1,the film is about an english family member who,the film was filmed in black in california
1,not just a typical western story with plenty of sex but a few,not that it was a good film and i would n't bother
1,look at the way in which the movie is supposed all that you have to do,look like a bad film but it 's just so bad that it 's just not funny
1,he was the first to die and the rest is a little too heavy to be good,he 's the one to the film because he is a very natural man whose actions are so
1,recently i thought the first movie was good and i liked that it was not a great one but,recently i have to say i did n't feel the urge to get my money around the set
1,the acting in this movie is very good,the plot in my opinion is a bit hard
1,the main characters seem pretty onedimensional and they do n't seem to have any real motivation,the only other actor from this film that he appeared is is a bit older
1,he does the usual job with some of the best acting i have seen since sunrise and it,he 's also very good in the movie which i liked and the movie was well acted
1,sorry but it does n't mean it 's a,sorry for the fact this movie is n't
1,we get the chance and a few minutes before the camera goes back in the air and the,we have to be more than we know to be and we have some pretty good ones
1,the only reason i gave this movie a,the film is so dark and creepy
1,this is one more of those movies i have seen in my lifetime as one person who likes it,this movie is not about a very long haired person and a little boy 's father who is trying the
1,good luck to the movie makers who gave this movie some credit,good luck to anyone involved in the making of this mess and what
1,tanguy has to play with his mother because he was,tanguy has a very nice life in the film
1,strong in the context the plot is pretty much nonexistent,strong character study of the two leads of a young couple
1,the acting is superb the direction is excellent the,the acting in the movie is just awful
1,i have just finished watching him perform a guitar,i ca only imagine that a real story of an
1,it 's a real treat for those who are into the original,it is a very good film with great acting and a lot more
1,right away from a good cast like this movie it has a,right away it was a nice idea to make a movie
1,frederick 's direction is very good with the right amount but it does n't help that the movie has a decent amount,frederick 's brother who goes from a different relationship with his father and son is determined for his mother 's life
1,christopher walken in one scene plays a character that has a distinct charm,christopher plummer is not the most talented actors of this caliber but i liked
1,sudden impact on those of us with more,sudden impact is a very interesting film
1,let 's make a film that looks cheap,let me start by saying this and i have
1,but that 's just my ticket,but the rest of the cast is
1,do not waste your money on something else,do n't let me start at my local library
1,i 've got to say that when i went out to the,i saw this film yesterday and was very impressed with it
1,it 's really hard to imagine,it was a very pleasant movie
1,when we are not talking about his work it seems very unlikely that some have changed it for a good deal since it 's a very good movie it is just awful the whole movie seems like,when there 's a couple other things like a good movie you 'll just have a few hours of your day rooting for something new for you but you know that this is n't a blockbuster
1,save yourself a waste see a lot more bad films,save yourself the time this time this is a stinker
1,maybe a tad bit of an odd but still true story,maybe this is a good movie because it did have a great
1,can i mention the plot is really bad even,can this story be so much more interesting
1,one wonders if we would choose it with a different director to fill in the blanks,one scene where i watched the original film version of one of my favorites was the one
1,the only thing i liked was the music and the acting,the story is interesting and the ending is pretty decent too
1,for the rest of us we can easily appreciate a lot of things that have changed here but do n't,for a very long movie to watch with a group you do have a good time watching this film
1,this is a very low point in the film,this is a movie where a bunch and a lot
1,and the final scenes that were pretty good to me,and the story of a young boy who works in the
1,the story was a very good one,the acting by all is fine and the
1,one can almost see in my eyes that,one of the best movies to die
1,it 's just that when you have the right amount it 's a complete mess with the same kind of jokes you have come to the other end,it 's like they do not even make sense of a story as it takes place entirely in the dark and the end and is very boring
1,practically every line spoken with a smile on it and it 's a bit of a joke,practically all films are not funny and it is hard to understand why there were so many films
1,an excellent movie i have to watch just for the sake,an enjoyable film that deserves more attention than you might see
1,4 why is that that they do n't have to get to the point they know what they are doing in their car and,4 the story was a bit of hard and i really think this was done by a guy with his wife and daughter
1,it 's not really any more a movie or a thriller,it is one of the best movies of the 1930s with a
1,it seems as if the writer wanted,it does n't feel like that
1,we have a story line from a new england movie with a lot of twists and many different,we are treated to some of the most beautiful scenes ever done in the history of cinema
1,also the story was very good,also the characters in this film are
1,it 's like the producers wanted to go through the whole time making us think of themselves in an effort to attract,it 's a pity the producers were so keen to work with the production company and put on the cheap market
1,until we are supposed to see the most frightening part about the movie and is able in it 's own hands and the final scenes are pretty,until the end of the story they were all so real that we could have been left wondering where it was from the point of view
1,congratulations if you 're a diehard freddy fan this one will,congratulations to the director and cast and the music industry
1,to say the least i should mention to the fact this is,to be fair there would never be more than 3 episodes
1,and if you like that it is worth watching and you will hate this movie,and he gets her a chance she is not in this role but she is a
1,there is no doubt there were no real problems,there have been numerous other reviews on this movie as
1,55 out there and it 's a perfect match to sit back relax and enjoy a nice time and place a long time,55 years ago a group of young people have been murdered in a car in the country and in the city of ember they
1,however i do n't think this movie was a complete success because i had the,however i have to say i had a headache and a smile at me
1,last year the series became the second one for a year of the week and,last year i saw the movie i was on the edge of a rock
1,the story is a very weak way to begin the movie and,the only good thing about this film is it 's plot
1,probably the best actor in history was played by,probably the finest movie i 've seen ever
1,this was n't a good movie but it was very good,this movie was the first movie that actually did the trick and
1,if you have read the manga this is a film,if the film had n't finished and had to compete in
1,those who liked it and who think that this movie,those scenes are very similar to those of us
1,the music is excellent and the actors make great impressions in this movie and it 's a joy,the story begins a few years after a group that is a little too eager to be taken to
1,this is another example of how a filmmaker has a talent to,this is a really great documentary and a very touching one
1,it was n't for what it actually was it was a bunch of other people,it 's not that we get to know the killer 's actions but the plot and
1,quick enough to determine for yourself but the plot is more complicated,quick is the main event of the original novel but the title says
1,well the movie is a great example as for it being a horror film,well the story line is so stupid and so predictable that it becomes impossible for
1,note how he manages to take control from the first,note that i could n't stand watching this movie
1,i did n't expect too much from this movie and i do not care,i am amazed to find that i will have to watch the movie as soon
1,it 's a shame because it has more heart and,it is the same person who has directed this
1,but i can understand that this is a movie from beginning to end and the fact is i did n't watch it all it was,but the film is a complete waste of my time and money spent for this film i was expecting to be disappointed but i just saw
1,however this movie is not the greatest horror movie,however this film is a masterpiece of beauty
1,much of the film has already been shown the way the audience is treated to a film which makes no excuses to do what 's being called a film of a film by which time and effort can be viewed,much of this is due by the actors in which the film is set and that their relationship does n't work in the context department and not only the director 's cut but the director and cinematographer 's head on the
1,wenders 's style has been done by the filmmaker 's work and the result is a good example of what the,wenders 's film is the first one that makes you think that you 're just watching the action and suspense
1,and he is now in the hospital of the,and the movie is a lot of funny
1,the acting is poor and the plot lacks any kind of tension,the first movie was the weakest and i expected a sequel from the
1,paz correct was an awful idea,paz vega is the best in her
1,likewise for one that is the story of a young boy named angus a young child who,likewise you 'll laugh a little and even the most ardent fans would appreciate the soundtrack
1,i could n't figure out which was what he is going through the entire plot of the book but the film is still an,i 've read other movies i 've seen with this in my opinion but there is no question that they were so good
1,perkins does so little to be in it but the movie is a bit over the heads as,perkins is very funny but is n't given any chance into this movie until his untimely death
1,if you 're a fan do not watch this film you will probably not be bored,if this movie ever made it in the first place it is very much the director of
1,this movie would 've done much better for those,this is why the show never got aired on dvd
1,you 're a moron you are in,you are watching this movie because you are
1,and then it is a big fat joke to make the film so much funnier,and i am sure that the filmmakers were going for making the film for me
1,then we cut the film to the end that a guy could have a woman,then there would be a chance to bring down the film and the story is quite
1,we also get to hear people dressed up on the streets and the,we have seen the entire series and is not a bit surprised
1,watch the first three movies in this genre,watch the original with all your friends as the
1,note that this is probably one of his films,note if not the most exciting i 've had in
1,i do n't mind you and i know this is supposed to,i was surprised that there was not much to this movie
1,first of all what do these writers,first of all i was bored
1,rudolf the movie opens the same way,rudolf is the perfect villain for me a
1,i was surprised to see that this movie was shot,i was hoping that some good old fashioned actors would get
1,i do n't know where the film was due to the fact it was a bad script with nothing to do with the plot,i was not in tears or cursing but i was n't sure if the director would get the director to cut him or his own
1,sorry if you do n't have the same problems but the,sorry about this and all the other negative comments here
1,in fact she had n't looked better and had nothing on my tv but was,in the end they make it a big surprise to the viewer 's story
1,as i watch a lot of movies i have a fondness for this to be a good movie but it still makes a great contribution,as for the other actors well it was very nice seeing them both as a young couple of friends who are able to escape from new
1,some of you have a better understanding that the movie is a little predictable to begin with but what did i think that was the point of it,some of these characters are also in love and it 's difficult to relate to the story of the characters which they were trying to convey in depth which
1,maybe that 's all the point of it is not so much as an insult,maybe if it was n't that i thought the script was very lame i do know
1,trust it it was one of the worst things,trust me you will get a few chuckles
1,russell has a very funny cameo as a man who wants to make his life miserable but a very young boy who makes life is his undoing,russell is a master and he has done such a good work in all accounts and is one who can be a genius to sit through
1,in the book they have a chance on the relationship between the boy and the woman,in the first half of a series of events it 's clear that the audience was in
1,see it if you 're in need,see the other two examples of what you
1,like i said you 'll want me to make a movie,like this movie the whole thing is really a bunch of bad
1,this is n't a film with its cast and crew,this film is one that should be seen as a way
1,in my opinion this episode is far inferior to those of the,in fact i would n't watch this movie for any reason
1,admittedly the movie lacks any real sense of urgency,admittedly we were not given the clues that are answered
1,he is also a good guy and there is a lot of good things about the movie,he just keeps calling and then the camera pans down on him and he looks like a cross
1,the whole cast is a perfect example,the movie had a really good story and
1,major complaints about this show include the characters in this,major spoilers ahead the film is an incoherent mess
1,i do not know what to say because it was so boring i had a lot of friends of mine,i could have written the first hour to be had that 's because i was too busy trying too
1,i think the reason why this film is so bad it 's good,i was not prepared but there was an attempt here to keep you going
1,this movie is just another example to watch one of those films,this is a bad movie it 's bad it is awful
1,this is one of the worst movie,this movie had no redeeming value
1,i was able for more of them and the more i was looking after my eyes at a blank screen,i ca all think they should just rerelease an old lady who is trying to be in a movie but the
1,it 's all pretty fun to listen but that has it 's charms,it is just a bad movie and just as bad that it was
1,two of the greatest and most respected stars in the cast were not too much and in that regard,two things do n't go to the next and the actors just stand there wondering at their own
1,you 'd think that the two main character,you can tell it 's a spoof
1,and when you see it you do what you 're looking for but still you know how many people have been on the same movie,and that is the real deal of the movie and is probably the reason they keep making films that are n't so long as they have
1,my only criticism is the way i watched him and his family,my friend and we had all our children growing to think they had
1,cuba has made one long films,cuba gooding jr as a detective who
1,the actors were all very very good especially richard benjamin and his excellent,the director is a good actress and the whole cast is fine
1,first of alli is the title in the movie and was completely untrue as the whole,first it takes me to a movie that does n't get any further than that
1,even the most ardent of the old ones in this movie should have been left alone,even though it was a long long time ago i felt that the show has no place
1,fun for the first half the story is about a little girl named melissa who is n't quite a young woman,fun and entertaining to the fans of the genre and the ones that do n't have the benefit of a decent film
1,or do n't worry about the subject matter it has,or that would be more of an explanation than a documentary
1,after the death of her friend and the woman 's life she does n't,after a while he gets involved and his father is n't a hero
1,i really liked this film and i do n't like this,i have to say it was a pretty enjoyable movie
1,he does n't try and pull a candle to his other films but he is a pretty good actor,he 's one of my favorite films of the year and this was one that everyone will enjoy
1,but then this movie will end you have an iq,but then it is a little bit different to those of
1,the acting is terrible the script worse,the cast makes an excellent movie
1,this is the second film that i 've seen and i was stunned to,this is a must see for anyone who loves action cinema and suspense
1,if you 're a fan who can do a pretty bad job at that time rent this,if the film is n't a drama it should be a lot less fun to watch
1,all in the same way that i was not expecting anything in a movie with a great plot,all i can say is that i am sure it 's been done by a bunch and they do
1,duane murphy is just too bland to do anything,duane stiller and matt gordon are great comedians
1,this movie has everything a horror genre can possibly do,this is one thing where there were the very little nods
1,a film that you could have fun at yourself,a must see but not a total loss
1,but even the most ardent movie watcher will enjoy this movie as it is a mustsee,but it is still a film that 's so well crafted that it is almost a joy
1,yes it was a movie to see but the rest of the film was a mess it,yes it 's funny and there is the occasional amount of blood but it 's not
1,he was never on the cover of the dvd and he 's got the whole,he has some very good moments and a lot of them to be funny
1,back in his youth he 's just too young and too much to ask his life,back in the 1980s the main characters of the series are always in the family and in
1,if you like watching movies that do nothing but go to a local cinema with some cheap special fx bad cgi effects and cheesy dialogue you should watch them all,if the film is an adaptation of a classic story it 's about a woman named sosuke who has no qualms of her own life and does everything she does
1,it 's really hard to understand why this guy did not have this one to be made,it seemed to have gone on forever in the past to mid 2000s on the success of a
1,dame edna is a bit of an unintelligent actress,dame betty 's boyfriend is the first film from a
1,i would recommend this movie for anyone interested with the fact,i would highly disagree with the critics if you are a fan
1,if only the director would be able at some things that,if this is your first film you want it will
1,i am glad that i had seen this movie,i have never seen anything that 's so bad as
1,for the most memorable moments of all time the film is about a man trying to kill himself and her daughter,for those of us who have seen this film you have to wonder if this is another masterpiece a masterpiece for those
1,she was a young actress and was very popular in the fifties and her performance in a film with her performance,she gets a chance to be a whore with a chip in my eye but she is n't the typical
1,too bad this movie is so bad that it makes it look like a cheap movie in any sense,too bad the ending of the film does never show up and it is n't the best thing i 've
1,guy was a real boy a good movie,guy ritchie is one of many things he can
1,the first half of this one is just awful,the only real problem with this movie has to be
1,granted it might be a little too long and in fact it does deliver,granted the actors and actresses and actresses were good but that was all
1,so what about the story here,so the audience is not interested to
1,staying away from a movie for an,staying away for some odd moments
1,on the other it 's just an awful movie,on a positive side the plot had potential
1,secondly for instance the acting is the least,secondly this movie does not even have a plot
1,on my personal opinion it does n't seem to me to have a lot of problems with this film and it did not quite work for me,on the whole a film that has the same effect and feel of the characters as a whole this is an attempt by other people to make something
1,2 the characters were n't developed to me,2 the scene where we 're talking to people
1,as the story progresses i found myself cheering for the characters,as for what i think of it i 've seen this
1,i have n't liked it since seeing this in,i have watched this film for 5 years
1,films can only come back at least to the end,films like the texas chain and the green berets are always
1,the only good scene is when the girls are talking and talking about sex and you think that they are n't going to,the story is simple and full circle is that it 's the same sort for every human and twisted to do it
1,a group full house is an unpleasant film with a little humor and a lot but no laughs,a few days later i was able into the story of one of the greatest directors of the last
1,it could be called a comedy and,it 's a nice little movie
1,this film is so bad that i ca n't,this is my personal favourite from this movie
1,but for the most of us who like the other films,but he has the power to show that she was a good
1,this is not one movie you will want to see,this film is a perfect example for an otherwise good movie
1,aspects of it are n't even as memorable but it has no impact on the viewer,aspects include this documentary and i would like to see what 's supposed to happen to the
1,the movie takes over a hour and a half of a long time that i could have done without spoiling the,the movie is not as polished as it seems to be a film like this with a cast of friends
1,outside i 've heard that this was a madefortv film that i would recommend it to anyone,outside of their own lives he and the sheriff and the family are not in the neighborhood and
1,according to most imdb reviewers this movie was a little too dark but the script itself was pretty awful,according to all he was the most levelheaded character we 're talking to the film i felt cheated by the
1,the only problem with a film that is being shown is the fact he 's so unlikable that his character is too short,the ending is so much more than that i just felt embarrassed because they did n't feel like they were doing that
1,off a cliff 's head in a lake a man 's life comes to life,off my top ten i am obligated to say there is a lot of people who
1,ace 's father was a very very,ace and south park in fact
1,if your a person i recommend you see this film and enjoy it because it is not as good as i did,if you are to go into an art teacher 's world to get the movie to your collection this film is a mustsee
1,at least not as good by its predecessor as the title of the book a lot,at times a little slow paced but not nearly as good it 's almost flawless
1,i did find it boring that the plot was the same one that had a much better story than the characters so i did n't know it was about the story,i saw many reviews before seeing the movie and found it offensive and disturbing but at least i could have imagined that the film was a real stinker at best but in
1,of course if it does have a great supporting,of course this is an awful bad movie
1,still i did laugh through some parts the dialogue was so funny it was painful,still the film itself is n't as bad as those are the things that make the
1,instead he is n't given the chance to get across,instead it is a poor excuse for a movie
1,nestor is a bit over the edge in his portrayal,nestor a middleaged lawyer and former student who in the first
1,of all the things i 've seen in the past i would give this,of course in the movie a guy is going to win some money
1,i love that the movie is just,i just saw this movie yesterday
1,in other words a character named troy is in this movie as a person who,in addition to this movie the movie was a little too long for me
1,the movie was not about the evils and war of the time it 's about the struggle between two brothers and the other that they do in society to help it with them and in one case another of the characters is n't all over,the story was interesting and i could n't understand what was coming next but it had all the right elements to do in the film that it 's just the usual action that really made no sense the plot was very interesting and the actors were
1,and i mean they did not use the words in any,and if only the best ever ever seen this film
1,there 's no doubt that it is a remake,there is a lot more in this movie than just
1,the plot is quite basic and very predictable but you do n't,the film also features the famous donald sutherland and john cleese
1,whomever thought the movie would be made for those looking like a bad bad movie to begin with but,whomever wrote the script and thought it was going to end up with the ending and the movie
1,this is a movie that has a cult following and is,this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,the acting is bad the plot is lame and it 's just stupid and dumb and boring,the story of the movie revolves around inman and his family who had been taken by the family
1,its really a fun to watch,its not as good but its pretty
1,the movie is a good movie for the time but i really really ca n't say that i,the plot involves a very young couple who are living in an old town for two years
1,everyone in the movie was so stupid,everyone 's favourite and you should be in
1,why not give the movie a chance and it will be released in a new world,why was this film so popular i just could not believe it was released on dvd because
1,i really liked this movie as being a fun movie,i was shocked at him for being such that this is
1,this film has some very funny scenes,this is one of my favorites
1,the first half of this movie is a classic,the main reason i saw this dvd was because it
1,they are just so bad you do n't believe them when they,they are so real at the end that they do so
1,the story starts with a group with a group called their turf and some of the people in town are attacked,the plot is so predictable that the characters can be so stupid that the viewer is actually rooting for them
1,the director should 've known that the only way to get this movie was to make sure it,the story is not about the battle between the two brothers and it 's also rather confusing
1,also the ending is really the same as when the doctor says that he is no longer a woman but a real person,also the fact that it takes a couple of episodes to be shown in the beginning of the movie is quite a bit of
1,helene seems a little bit too much like the,helene 's daughter is the daughter 's daughter
1,is a really good movie with bad actors,is it supposed to be a comedy or a
1,it 's a great movie for everyone involved but if it is a film of a young lad and one,it 's one that is about a man searching to get rid of the death that he 's on
1,it 's not a horror film either it is,it 's not the greatest movie ever made
1,when the film opens he becomes a victim of the world and the us who he is for a reason to,when she is confronted with an incurable accident that is so obvious that she 'll leave the room and continue
1,this movie was the best and most memorable of the movie and is probably the best movie i have ever watched,this film is so bad that you can make sure someone who is the only person to die for and is the
1,the film itself is a complete embarrassment,the whole movie is a mess
1,i 've just recently got this out of my mind watching it and i'm glad i watched this crap again and never seen,i 've seen this movie and i have to disagree because it 's the only other film that i have ever seen
1,this is a great movie and should please,this movie was made by professionals as a kid
1,the first half is a spoof of a classic horror horror,the film is not only boring it 's downright funny
1,but the film is so awful that its hard to believe that there should be an explanation for a,but it is also one that i think is the most overrated and funniest thing of all time
1,i 've never been a fan so the film 's plot was a little rushed but it had an excellent amount,i was not disappointed with her in the movie but it was so bad that i would have given it a 2
1,garish and moody is a pretty well done piece that makes me,garish and very atmospheric in it is an action of sorts
1,the story is just an excuse not to take place in a world that,the ending is a bit abrupt and you have no sense at all
1,does n't the story line have to be summarized and,does i mention that he 's a real person
1,apparently the film has been released on vhs and is,apparently she was the only character on her own
1,you could see the potential of the film but you can,you 're going for a movie that is worth watching
1,obnoxious and annoying characters like the other characters did not help to make them so annoying,obnoxious and dumber and a waste your time with such crap but the movie itself has a
1,the story revolves around a young woman who is kidnapped by her husband a rich man whose parents died and who have,the film is an extremely beautiful movie from all the actors in an unusual world that is very difficult to take
1,wow the title says it 's just an action movie,wow i 'll never watch it again i am a teenager
1,meanwhile the killer is on his mission so he does n't have the benefit of a police,meanwhile the man finds out he 's not one of them so why not get there
1,the actors in the cast were pretty cool as,the movie is a little bit too melodramatic
1,do not waste your time watching this movie in the first place,do they want to make it into the world with all that
1,she has her moments but not quite sure what the plot is like,she does n't want to be anything but a caricature and she does not
1,why do i care for the actors who are in this movie,why the two are not so popular in their own way
1,it 's not for everyone but the whole family is watching it in a fun movie,it 's a pity that so many of the movies were shot as an example that one
1,them both of which have the same sense to live up against the rules of the city,them were the ones who did n't think it had a lot of people to do
1,i do n't think this could have come up with more so on the other side of the spectrum,i saw in my family and i was looking for the movie to work as an action film
1,not the greatest of any movie but it 's,not even a good movie i have seen
1,i'm not saying that a person who 's been offended by this show is n't really a member,i'm sure that if the story was about them all it was good i would watch it at the
1,on the other hand it 's still a good movie if that 's something you 'll watch on a sunday afternoon or a,on the whole it 's a good thing to view but in the end the film really gets worse as it progresses
1,so if it was a drama in the first scene the movie would have to have been a big hit,so why was this movie so good to the audience it just did n't take much of a plot
1,shot in a cheap manner with a few camera shots of the camera linger on camera we are forced by a bunch that 's a bit too much on this,shot by the same director who had seen the trailer and liked this one as a horror film there are a couple of decent scares including one of the best i
1,it is a little slow but also good to know the story of such things,it is a good movie with a great cast of good actors and i can honestly
1,ordinarily i did not feel the movie was about the plot but it was n't,ordinarily i had not been very happy with the original series but was so excited about
1,i had high hopes for this to come out of the blue and i just did to what would be a lot like me,i was able into this movie because i was so engrossed to see how it ended i kept wondering what was going through this movie
1,you know the drill in the first place where you get the point,you have to see the movie if you have the opportunity in your life
1,i have n't ever seen a more accurate story that i do,i have n't been so disappointed by the idea for such a film
1,it is just a shame to get a hold of a story line and make it an action movie and not a movie,it 's not a horror movie it 's just a bunch of old clichs and pointless characters that make a movie like this seem
1,what happened here is an amazing story,what was a lot to like in it
1,if you 're looking to enjoy a good show see that and the sopranos,if you 're thinking of renting a copy of this show in a store then
1,it 's an awful movie if the movie was n't so,it is a simple story and i really enjoy it
1,one of those movies like the title song is a very important theme but then a bit later that,one could imagine a great deal but it 's a bit too much for a child to watch
1,their chemistry with a guy on a mission with axes and ceilings is so,their performances are so bad they ca all even to withstand their lines
1,as a matter it is a rather enjoyable film and i will give it a 7,as for all concerned that he 's been there in the middle of the world his father
1,we all laughed once during this movie,we 're not going for the ending of
1,in this day it 's a little too late to be taken in,in many cases there is more to this movie than the first
1,perhaps she would have had the opportunity to make a sequel,perhaps the most important thing about the show is the way it
1,the film is one to watch with only a few beers and a few moments are worth a watch,the whole movie seems to have been rushed up to a point that you will be left with your own
1,here he does nothing in this film and there,here i think it was a good movie
1,but i think a movie called it 's worth,but if you do it with a grain of humor
1,as for the rest it is a film,as for the performances of the characters i think
1,michael caine is great as the villain,michael dudikoff is in this one as always
1,he 's an idiot and his own,he just seems like an idiot with a
1,the only difference with this show was that when i watched this movie i found the story to be just plain stupid,the movie is filled on and out with some interesting dialogue and some nice dialogue like the one who thinks of the way
1,if you are looking for a horror film do n't be taken to a film,if the script was so bad that the actor playing the main character was played straight
1,and if you like the kind of movie that is in your heart i guess i'm gonna do a bit of research,and then the movie switches to the fact she was supposed as a kind character and it 's only a minor element that
1,keep my mouth open for my own,keep the film from falling off
1,at least it was n't scary just like the first one but still i found some good parts,at least the movie is n't worth a second look a little too much for some of the most
1,the only time i watched it was for the end of the end,the story is not that interesting but that is how it gets
1,oh yeah it 's a good thing because you have to say that,oh and the other half of the movie is a bit long
1,your heart is a little more than most of you can imagine,your favorite of this genre is it 's not as good and far
1,fortunately they had to pay a visit to him and not that they do n't,fortunately for a lot of these characters it never seems to work for them
1,who knew the same guy who was in this movie and why the sheriff,who did n't care less about a movie which was not even good
1,if it was n't for his character it 's just plain silly and so boring that it 's just annoying as hell,if you enjoy bad action movies and you do n't like movies that have a few things to offer and you think about
1,the script is n't as bad as the other two films but in a lot of it,the film is a comedy not in the least funny or witty or funny at all
1,the plot revolves on how the two men survive and their mutual friendship,the director and actors in this movie are either incompetent or inept
1,and when you have a bunch or a few of your friends you 're just getting a lot of fun out there,and when it 's not all that it 's not so much of the plot it is not that much of anything
1,210 rated pg for graphic violence nudity and strong language which makes it,210 and you may have to be a bit unstable at times
1,its not just an attempt to mix in with a plot it fails miserably,its a movie that has a heart lesson in its head for the sake of
1,it is a real shame as a comedy,it 's a pretty good film about the life
1,despondent and confused is a very good show in which every episode is so entertaining and,despondent and old friends are killed by a giant monster that is in some shape
1,see the old and the ugly guy at the motel,see it with the lights on you and the movie wo
1,petrie is a great actor as the title character is a little too hard to swallow and he is,petrie 's direction is n't too bad but there is a decent amount of humor here and there
1,the movie has a nice plot twists and turns in that one liners that,the story is so simple that you 're actually going nowhere in time
1,the only other thing i can fault is the music,the acting is very bad with the main cast being a
1,i do not think you could have a movie with a great cast for this movie,i saw his first film and the film was not a complete waste of good time
1,not only do they get out of hand but they are just the best friends,not that it was a mistake for the writers to make any of them even if
1,when he finally decides he is on the brink that he has his own reason the whole thing is just not as good,when it ends on the heels of the plot the film gets a bit tedious at times and is just plain confusing
1,the cast members who put up with their roles are very good,the acting was horrible at worst the directing were atrocious the directing horrible
1,the acting was bad the plot was pretty weak,the acting is superb for a young film of the
1,thanks for that one thing they made in,thanks the film for its technical merit
1,as a movie this was not a good film,as a matter of fact i have no idea why
1,this movie is one thing which makes it difficult for me because of what they 're,this has got to have been a problem to get a hold of a movie
1,the story is about a young woman who 's hired to live in new orleans but is forced to spend money in france,the first and only thing that i did n't notice was the ending the movie is a complete mess of the original
1,not that i 've got to be subjected to one man as the hero 's wife,not for those who want to have a good laugh at the movie and enjoy every bit
1,this movie was a total waste and i think that the casting of meryl,this film shows the most disgusting things in this movie the entire world
1,yes you have a movie that makes no excuses but to be a film,yes i have to say that it was so boring and the characters were unbelievable
1,well that was a real shame,well there are some very interesting scenes
1,the movie is an exercise in selfindulgence,the acting the script even the music sucked
1,this was made up in several ways by a man of the gods with a very strong script from the movie 's first film,this is the story of two guys who are married to each of their parents and the mother they have to deal in with each
1,michael dudikoff is an amazing actor and does n't have much in the way of character motivation,michael myers is a great villain and there 's a bit of blood in it for him i
1,once again this is where a movie really begins and the story is quite basic but at least it is not,once a week is a success from start to time and as a matter of fact the story has been done by
1,patrick bergin as always has proved that this is the finest show ever that was in his peak,patrick stewart is also fine and the only good actor in this movie is david bradley who is a
1,cornell is also pretty much always a good guy,cornell was great as the villain and the story was
1,the director of this movie should have gone back into this film as the best way for it to be made as,the only thing that makes it watchable is the way the director chose to explain the real nature of the plot
1,310 the only good way to see,310 for a very generous film
1,if this film ever gets released in the us i hope to find it somewhere again soon,if this were what we were supposed for an hour into this movie the movie would be an
1,but that is about the only way to describe it,but if this was a tv film and just like all
1,later on he meets three guys in a small highrise,later on i saw an interview with a group that was
1,that was a huge waste of time and money,that the film is not really made for television is
1,the story revolves around the characters and the story 's plot unfolds in such a,the acting in this film is very good as is what it really did
1,leonard rains as the mother and his son is not nearly convincing but,leonard baumbach was a genius in the movie 's most famous role
1,i saw this movie at the 2001 palm barbara movie international festival but i have to say that in the end there are some really cool and enjoyable,i ca never really see why these two people seem to take their roles as they are n't all that much less exciting or funny for that
1,for example the movie starts as the group moves,for an action movie you should n't go
1,estevez does some pretty well but his role is n't really a little bit wooden and the plot is n't very interesting and is not a good movie and is not worth it at all to have,estevez who does n't have great charisma but manages a character that has more to do with this rather than an adult who looks the part and the film is so good at its job that i almost
1,sometimes the movie just has an atmosphere to it,sometimes the characters are very likable and are able but
1,but for the most part there is,but it just was n't bad
1,i really enjoyed it but i do n't know what to say,i had a great feeling of nostalgia and joy and a lot of
1,this is the worst movie i have,this is a very bad film
1,lets hope it gets a 2 out on the way that it 's so bad and it is,lets face the movie is the biggest flaw of its existence to be learned to exploit it
1,as a whole i found i found that a lot had passed out of a,as a result of the story there is a problem of having a child
1,my favorite scene is when his car is stolen and we all see a scene involving a car chase through the woods,my favorite part is when we are watching the scene when we see a scene when the kids are talking about it
1,all the performances are all over the place in this movie,all of these things happen on the screen and there are moments
1,the main character is the real killer which is also referred to as a very human villain the film just seemed to fall flat on its face but overall it was just great fun as well,the film is about a group that moves from the past and into one another and the other two guys decide to leave and get rid of all of the world 's oldest women so they have
1,kevin bacon is a revelation and he has been quite good since he made an appearance of his brother,kevin spacey is a great actor but here he is the hero of the film not even a cameo of
1,ever saw a film and not just because of it is very bad,ever the film 's soundtrack was released by the studio in the 1930 days
1,if this were a movie i could be thinking that the movie was made a couple of years later,if you like action movies or are looking at movies i 'd be hard but please give it a shot
1,the movie opens with an assassination attempt with a bunch of kids,the first 30 min is excellent the best part of this film is
1,american enfants de la bestia was shot at the,american chien andalou should have won oscars nominations
1,still though this flick does offer a bit of a shock to the entire cast especially since it is the film 's final act it is the most obvious,still she 's in fact pretty sweet for the part and her scenes with her are very believable and well worth your attention and the characters seem like we all
1,ultimately the story does n't really go,ultimately it 's an excellent thriller
1,this is a very bad movie,this is a film for everyone who
1,this movie is just so bad,this is a very very bad movie
1,after all the world has taken over and is now in the,after all is said to be a comedy in the vein
1,a very nice cast a good plot great actors and a story with a strong sense of humor,a lot of other people on this board seem to enjoy this movie too and for the most part
1,adam goldberg and matt dillon are great actors as one dimensional and a young and a dozen in the same way,adam is not really a movie he has the right amount of humor to do in the story and the whole time
1,some of these actors were very good especially sean connery who did not play his character,some of the most impressive scenes and some of his scenes are when an artist has the
1,there 's a nice little scene in the movie where you get to see this movie is on a different level but then the film has a certain,there are lots of things to look at but there is nothing that would have been made to be made for the film to really work out
1,that 's exactly what happens when you see a,that should not even get it 's message
1,i would like to add the two i have never found the perfect movie,i could n't help but think that this movie could be seen with some of
1,directed and written and written by kevin kline,directed for laughs i was bored and i never
1,it is just so much fun to see the movie and its impact on how it 's done so it makes for another great experience to watch and is a good movie for the whole family,it 's a film to be entertained when you want to make fun of it but i doubt the real reason to love it is that it does n't seem like the director had the slightest attention
1,his character is so bland that you wonder why someone would like a movie,his best friend 's wife who has never been able and is a bit reluctant
1,spoiler below you 're not sure if you 're really the audience 's interest or do you just want to be,spoiler spoilers but it 's a movie that does not have any redeeming qualities or at least it is watchable
1,were you watching those of these guys from the beginning of this piece,were there any redeeming quality that was so good that they seemed embarrassed to
1,just the whole series is about the whole family,just a few years after watching this one
1,those who were n't involved to learn that this has been shot on a shoestring budget,those who think they know a lot about the past will be more likely to enjoy this
1,the only reason the movie was banned is because the film is set in the future so that they,the movie is n't as bad as it was a good story line and a few great action
1,in fact it is not the best film i 've seen in fact but it is the funniest i will ever seen,in that regard it is a great movie and a great addition for a man to look for but that 's how this
1,you can also see what the director thought he was working as one that he,you 'll not miss this movie if you like it and enjoy the movie
1,s the only reason the story is good but for the,s the only person in the cast is in it
1,she 's a pretty good actress and she 's very believable in her roles,she 's not too attractive but at no where does i feel when she is
1,baseketball is a good show from start being funny,baseketball was a very funny show and i loved it
1,watch this film if you 've not been a fan,watch this movie and you will still be laughing
1,with the exception of the opening scene in this episode is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life,with the help you get from having a good time when the show does n't work as well as it has you
1,first let me say i thought it 'd be a nice movie to see for a long time,first of all it has been mentioned that the actors are not all that great they were not in
1,i do n't like how they can be such an amazing movie,i could only say i do n't think the film is the best
1,this is a film for the family and for adults will love,this is one of the best films i 've seen in a long
1,it 's not really the sort you can do is very good but you 've seen some good movies on a,it seems that the writer and director had a lot to do with the film at one point or another
1,i do n't want to give spoilers so much because i can only hope that you have n't seen,i ca n't understand why so many of us liked them and why people do not watch it
1,from start till that point there is no point at all,from his point the film is a bit dated but it is
1,the whole time i felt i was watching one of this series,the acting is so bad that i was n't disappointed in the movie
1,for instance the final scene with a guy impaled on a lawn wall to death,for all the complaints about comanche moon the original is an incredibly boring film
1,after seeing him again in his first appearance he is really the funniest of the bunch although it may have,after having endured the film i was very disappointed and was surprised at the low budget it gave it
1,during this one they are arrested after being killed and murdered by his wife,during the fight scenes this film is a perfect reflection of the very real human
1,if it was n't a bit of a disappointment it 's also the film 's best asset,if this has a movie you ca n't go away without the same story as the original
1,but as we see a woman in an odd state,but i do n't think so and you do not see
1,the movie has no action either,the director also has very little of
1,however the story is rather bland and the characters do so poorly,however after watching the whole movie it would make you think
1,they have to do it and i know that the movie is a joke,they are n't all as good in their movies as they do n't seem a
1,a very strange man who loves it but i do know he 's in a movie for no discernible reason and never really makes it to the table,a film that is so bad that it 's hard for anyone to take a look at the actors and get their hands on the floor like this for
1,regarding the ending the film 's resolution is very good but the end result is the film as,regarding the death of her child husband i thought the character was pretty much the best actor
1,am a huge fan and i know that it,am you in trouble with the movie makers
1,one day a young man returns home for her husband in order for the,one is to be a fan for the rest to work with me
1,the acting is n't bad as it is not just bad acting bad and it looks amateurish but it,the only saving grace to see this film are when it is n't as good as the first
1,as soon as we 're told the show is full of surprises,as for his acting in the cast the acting is superb
1,well it just does not work that is the worst,well the whole thing i was laughing and cheering
1,i do not know if it is a drama but the director makes his films with a distinct dose that will allow them in,i was in the right frame of my seat and this movie was a bit too old to be so funny to watch
1,thus the movie is really really poor and,thus we are all over this world
1,it 's not a film that can,it also has a great cast
1,that is the way the story progresses and the story is told,that 's a bit of a ripoff of the usual suspects
1,the story itself was n't great,the acting is n't bad though the
1,the only difference between the two,the film is a very enjoyable film
1,no the movie is n't for everyone,no one could 've done anything more than
1,too many cooks and a few minutes of my life,too bad that they made it through their paces
1,the story of the president as a child becomes one and his wife a father and,the plot was n't a good one but the acting was n't the main problem
1,the story is told very well by both of them,the plot is ridiculous and does n't seem real
1,because of this film the actors who have a good time making this,because the film was filmed and shot in the aftermath of time
1,once in my head we have our beloved hero who plays a man who is a bit of both and is a bit of a,once again this one is the best in the series because the actors are able to get them in and out their own lives
1,and as for it 's the best film on film,and it 's not that good for a laugh
1,the acting in this movie was so bad that i could not help laughing so,the director seems to be trying too to be too hard to be realistic
1,and as a child i found it very hard to believe in the movie for the film,and that in my view was a good idea and a really good ending to boot
1,burn a copy on vhs tape i have to,burn in this was a very bad film
1,when we get a bunch to hear and hear the characters are talking about the story that the director has created for the viewer,when the film came out the only one left was that the movie was a bit slow in the tooth when i read this review
1,an extremely boring attempt at a horror film with a bunch of people going for the missing opportunities to get in a decent,an old man in a military outpost that has been sent to a mental institution for a few months to go undercover
1,but that is n't a good thing,but this has no plot points
1,a few of the jokes have more comedy in it 's run like a movie,a few films have more laughs than it is nowadays that this film is
1,wow that is all i can watch,wow that is the worst part
1,remember it 's not even funny or funny,remember the old guy being a cop who is
1,it is like watching a tv series and i am sure it is a big deal,it is as if i was in the military of the united states and i was looking
1,the actors and actresses were good in a movie that was a little too long and was very disappointing,the acting was superb and i was really surprised at how bad the acting was in every scene
1,as for a lot less i have the problem,as a fan of the original series it seemed almost
1,as the show continues it becomes obvious that his character is not only a child but,as it stands there is no reason to watch this series if you like it
1,the film is about two boys in a very different world in england,the only difference between his films is that he 's not only a little
1,the only reason it has any merit is because of what was supposed to happen to it 's predecessor,the film is also a very nice adaptation of an excellent classic film by the excellent una sim who plays
1,it also does not help that he 's a good enough actor,it is difficult to believe a person that does n't like him but
1,but i 've heard what was worse than this turkey,but what was there to tell a good movie
1,we have a lot from the film which is what i 'd call for the plot to be interesting,we are shown that in this film we meet and see the film on a stormy night where they are
1,and the acting is horrible with all the clichs and,and i would like the to be seen more
1,for a long time i had to sit through it for a second chance and was pleasantly,for that time i will probably get a refund on the dvd release of this movie
1,marianne yeoh is the standout and i think he was perfect for the role of janie,marianne pfeiffer is very believable as her friend and a woman who gets her hands on the
1,to say more about the film is probably a mistake as,to those unfamiliar on the show should watch the series
1,serial killers of course do n't have the money of a young couple who have no idea of what a normal person should be able and is in the past and the future,serial killer should be ashamed of his own but instead is an insult to all viewers who are fans who have watched it and i think the story and characters will be better and
1,i was not even impressed by this movie and found myself unable to sit through the whole piece to enjoy the,i ca all about seeing the movie as soon but it 's one of the worst movies i 've seen
1,it 's just another excuse for someone to show off a good script,it 's like a bad movie with a little budget and the actors were
1,hotter than anything in the first one but that 's not a good sign,hotter as a child in a similar way with the exception of the old guy
1,cool in a bad way with a cast of characters that have nothing whatsoever to do,cool characters who play off the wall are the best i can think of this movie is
1,the movie is an absolute treat to see,the film is set in an isolated asylum
1,anyways a friend of the doctor who is a cop in this movie is obviously,anyways it 's a little bit slow but the movie is definitely worth seeing
1,in my opinion it has to be one that i would have been ashamed of by having it been available,in this case however this is n't a movie about the evils about the holocaust it 's like the story is
1,in fact he does have some problems with his role,in conclusion a few things are very few in a few
1,piven has been able to do much with the script and he 's not always at all convincing,piven and the other cast were so bad that you could n't care less about the characters in the
1,the movie starts slowly with a young lady trying to find her in a,the film is a real hoot because it makes no apologies or anything
1,they 're not all bad guys,they should have been allowed to have
1,there 's a few good points in the film such,there is some great gore scenes a good acting
1,as for it 's story well it 's not a bad movie,as the film moves along a film that goes in to the same
1,would they go to see it with them on a stormy afternoon and,would the makers of this mess have the rights on their own
1,the acting is so bad that i just found it hard for him,the ending is a bit rushed but the whole story unfolds nicely
1,if this film had a chance of going back in time to it they would,if not the worst movie ever made or even the worst of the year
1,fortunately he does n't realize that he and his friend had to,fortunately his wife and daughter are forced to fend about them
1,there is no plot no character development or even an exciting story,there were a lot of scenes that were very funny but i found
1,yet he also manages the story to the point where they 're going to,yet as i mentioned before the film is also in black and white
1,otherwise it is a film about the evils,otherwise this film is a complete bore
1,some of them were good for this film and that they were good,some of the scenes of the movie are so badly done the acting is
1,when all is said to be a big one and a very good one,when i first watched this film i thought it was really really interesting
1,a great cast and a fine director should have given the movie its best,a lot more than that but in some parts it seems that the director and
1,the plot was ok but it was n't a movie,the plot revolves around the young and lonely young woman who
1,now if only this movie would have been made available on video,now it is my duty to find this kind of stuff but it
1,the only thing good in the movie is if you do n't know what this is,the only reason why this movie is so bad was the acting and the plot which was
1,crime scenes were the only reason this film could have been filmed in the hands of a great director,crime is one of those rare movies that can be seen as if there are only three reasons for me
1,all is forgiven for the movie,all in his own life he is
1,to me the main problem with this film was the fact that the script is very predictable,to call the film a classic is that it is a film for an independent film not in
1,other actors who had a small budget were given,other than that this movie is pretty tame
1,the acting by the leading roles was very good particularly the actors who did not play their characters,the plot revolves around an evil man named sosuke who tries to solve the crimes from the first movie
1,the movie begins as the movie starts to happen at a very moment where the main characters go,the film is one gigantic piece of garbage but not so far that it is very entertaining
1,sure but not a great show,sure there are a number of problems
1,then he is forced into taking a drink in the back of the car so he 's able into a bank,then you have a guy who looks as he is trying to make himself a pee but not even that one is
1,he 's one big star star and his character is,he 's also the best man in the film
1,i thought it would be another interesting twist but this movie did not deliver on the whole story it was really too,i saw this movie as a child in the early sixties and thought that was what it was supposed to like
1,watch for that 's one of those rare gems of its time and the film 's,watch it to the ending with your kids you can just laugh for hours afterwards
1,they could not find much to love,they did not try to hide from his
1,but if you watch this show you 'll feel like you 're watching it and i am a bit of the fan,but if you want a nice film about the evils of a great story you should give the movie a try
1,and for those involved in this genre i was surprised that the story of jane austen 's acting in this film was n't a big hit by the,and the best part of most of the film is the flashback between the young and the girl and her father and the mother and the mother
1,she is so stupid and unbelievable that it was n't her character 's fault,she had to be with the most disgusting girl who had a heart of gold
1,the movie is just a boring attempt to cash a few,the first thing that struck the movie is the music
1,no wonder this is a film and for all involved they,no one should ever see an actor and his cronies
1,though in fact it would be more likely to make a film about the real life,though it was n't very bad the plot was really great and it was just plain stupid
1,i was expecting a more serious film but the film does not work much better,i have to wonder if it was intentional the movie was not that bad
1,a lot of movies that i 've seen in the theater have been a staple in years,a few minutes into the movie you 're just hoping the whole cast could have done better
1,the film also contains interviews with interviews from other films such as,the story is a joke but it 's all so predictable
1,i have to admit this is the worst film i have yet seen,i am amazed i never heard of the movie until i watched it
1,since there are no heroes in this film it 's just not a film,since the beginning was the only thing that made my brain stand out
1,while this is definitely not the movie i have to say but i have seen this movie in years,while it is n't very much more of a comedy it 's a very funny film with lots of laughs
1,considerable spoilers i 've heard about this film for a while and i,considerable spoilers i was expecting something like a remake from this movie
1,this movie makes no excuses or excuses,this is the film that i remember
1,the acting was good enough but it 's just too,the movie was also filled very well with it
1,william baldwin 's character is just so funny,william wyler gives a very fine portrayal as a
1,in the end i did n't care what was going but the first one was better,in other scenes they are so boring and so boring that the movie has no real story
1,whenever it came to acting and producing a lot less than most movies it had been made in,whenever watching him get naked he 's actually just plain stupid like the guy trying to act
1,as for his performances this one has a few moments of the script,as for me it was a real treat for everyone who was n't interested
1,i had to rewind on my own life and went along,i 've always seen some of her movies like that
1,barbara barrie was a real woman to look at,barbara stanwyck is the first to have a career with
1,it would be better if they would make a more accurate movie,it is difficult to believe anyone could ever find a sequel to any
1,stardust 's a great documentary is the best movie he made,stardust is a great drama film that is so underrated it 's
1,if this guy was trying to show that it was his worst attempt to save it from the other,if you do n't know why a good guy is killed is n't the reason why you 'll love this
1,flesh and geeks will be as great but the film 's success is a complete disaster,flesh is a very nice film that should be enjoyed by everyone especially with one 's heart
1,listen to the original the movie i thought that,listen it to the camera and the acting
1,how does this movie get made,how do you get the feeling that
1,this is what they are trying but can make it worth seeing,this movie is one that really should be released on the us
1,the film has one redeeming feature though,the movie takes a good deal
1,during a few weeks of a trial he travels the streets and gets his own car,during the day of the jackal the only person remaining and in this case is the father
1,years the film was a success for the eyes of the,years ago i saw this movie on a tv channel
1,still this was an excellent film with lots,still it would be good to see a movie
1,it is not long enough and the whole family is trying to get home,it 's not really a story but if it is on the same level of
1,i could not stand up to the rest,i saw this and i do n't remember the
1,one more thing he had to go to a small town where the president had a good deal of money and the money he spent to shoot on and to go for the job,one can see this as a masterpiece of cinema as i would be inclined for it to be released on dvd from the library of the library or if it was n't released theatrically
1,this is probably one of these films,this is a pretty good movie
1,well you have to go for the movie for an early 70s,well the whole movie could have been done more if the story had
1,this is a great movie for all ages and i loved it,this was a terrible movie and not even a bad movie
1,but in the beginning i think the main actor is very strong,but if you 're expecting a comedy you do not have to watch
1,as i watched the first movie you can only see what you did,as much of the story line as the characters were and the dialog of
1,the only reason i was able in this film was because of that,the movie has a few funny bits and i think the acting was decent
1,the ending is a bit cheesy,the acting is great especially streep 's
1,the plot is a familiar ground of the original story but the performances of their performances is also excellent for a few of their films,the actors play the main characters a real treat on the part which gives the movie a sense of what life is or what the characters
1,you will probably know how it is going on and you can understand what they 're thinking,you do n't have to think that these were the only people who had the ability for them
1,this is a movie that is guaranteed of,this is what makes this film great
1,by the end we are left with a lot of things thrown in,by the end of this movie you get to know what the secret of
1,this is one of those films which never really makes you care why it makes people think,this one was n't for everyone it 's just bad and it 's just too bad
1,i did n't want to see much of the movie because i think they would be too young to make,i have to say the lines are not funny and i could n't help to laugh at the characters
1,if you like to see an interesting film you wo n't like the characters,if you 've ever seen the whole movie there 's something wrong in this movie
1,this film would n't have made up an audience of more of any other films,this is a good film and i really liked it when the film came out the
1,van heflin does a terrific and restrained portrayal as the man and he 's very,van damme is a great martial artist actor who has never been so wooden
1,the plot is simple the acting from everyone is horrible,the story is simple and the characters are believable
1,sandler and pitt are great in their roles and each character is great,sandler is so bad he looks like he 's on the spot for an
1,he gets his revenge and gets a chance,he 's supposed to be the only survivor who
1,the movie is also notable and the acting is so bad it 's funny,the only character who seems to have something to play in is his mother who
1,a few years previously i saw this episode but it was the original show,a very funny scene in a long run and a lot the film does n't
1,the first half of my review was too high,the acting by the two lead actors is good
1,now i just wanted my brain to go to a film that 's supposed like a movie,now i know i can relate to any of the characters in the film who are all very
1,in fact this is a good thing for this,in my opinion i could see the ending
1,do not get me wrong i love,do n't worry on this one
1,and the scene shows the old lady talking to his daughter 's sister and his sister 's character,and it 's a pretty boring film that has some of its darkest actors in the cast
1,the plot has holes in it and the story is so ridiculous,the film is a perfect film to view and you will laugh at
1,lucky enough to attend the new york video store on the cheap tv channel,lucky enough of the film but is n't the only one of them
1,but it is n't as bad and the ending is quite good,but the whole movie just goes along with the flow and the acting
1,there was no reason to watch the original again,there have been many other movies i 've seen this
1,i would not have to agree with any other reviewer that the story is so convoluted that the acting would seem,i think he was an interesting choice for this movie but he is still the real master of the movie
1,at least the actors were good,at least you can see some of
1,normally i would n't have been much more angry,normally i would have made this movie as i had
1,this movie is a very boring and pointless attempt,this one is one that is quite funny
1,the plot is simple and the characters are shallow and not even likable enough,the first thing that i got was the great use the location shots in the
1,not in the same way as the book the film it was based upon,not to say that it 's all about a family and their own lives or
1,young men with an insatiable disposition will be able and for a film to be a big success,young women have a certain charm of their own and she makes this one very entertaining and very very
1,and if you have read any of you other than that and then,and as it turned the scene on the floor is really bad
1,john woo does a great job here in bringing down,john goodman was one more and most famous directors
1,the only redeeming qualities are the actors,the only saving house in a film are
1,in this one i thought it would be pretty entertaining,in this film we are told that the real life would
1,when it first came out i was surprised it made the movie great and i was impressed at the fact,when it comes to films the movie is just a bunch and the action is not as good as the first
1,hooper seems more interested than that of,hooper 's film works very well
1,unlike the rest of the action it seemed to be in no way over all the film,unlike another poster mentioned here the film is very good in its own right and in no respect
1,just like watching a train wreck and a bunch is made on the phone for about 5 minutes and the rest is a load,just like the first film in the series it takes us to a world where we get a feeling of what the real world will
1,the first half of the film is the worst ever the worst,the main character is very annoying and is a stupid character
1,it is a very well made movie,it 's as though the director of the
1,at this point they were just a bunch of random teenagers,at the same time that it has its flaws but still manages
1,we are supposed and believe that the director is a true friend in the way he addresses the events that are,we never have a movie with an adult heroine that looks so fake that it 's impossible to make fun
1,i saw the movie on the tv show and the second one,i do n't even know how this is a good film
1,the acting is poor and the characters are all very onedimensional,the whole thing seemed like a cross between an entire series of
1,bend of course and the ending makes no sense,bend the waves for the whole hour at times is
1,i have been wanting to see the last of the three sw adaptations i know but this one is more to the same extent,i ca all about it and i do n't really know that there are a lot of movies out there that are better
1,and this movie was one in the box office,and the fact is this movie is a big hit
1,he makes a fool a character and we are not alone in,he is very good in acting and he looks very comfortable
1,even if you are looking for an intelligent and compelling movie of the past this will be a must,even though the movie was filmed in color i would n't be able as to what the filmmakers have done
1,this movie is a joke but a real shame because it was just too slow for its own good,this is a very good piece of animation and i highly enjoyed the film immensely it is very well worth
1,this is a film that makes no real money,this is n't a movie that 's funny
1,still there have been many other similar elements that could have,still a few of his previous efforts are the best
1,a few seconds later a little extra is revealed,a lot of people have commented of it
1,that is the reason for why a man with a brain on the,that said a lot of movies have the potential of the original
1,this is the most interesting of the,this is a really great film
1,he was just trying to prove himself to a person,he was the one who gave the audience the needed attention
1,probably the director just wants to make a film about a young man who is trying to steal every girl he wants to become and to be a good one,probably if you do n't have to go watch a live breathing play like this one but the way the world has changed is that this was the perfect film for
1,excellent acting and special effects but nothing special,excellent performance from david niven who makes it so
1,since i could never see any of that movie in the world it was a good time,since i can recall in the movie that this movie is actually a good one it was n't
1,what is wrong now this is not just how the film is,what we were left was a bunch about an interesting plot
1,mornay dunne and her supporting cast were perfect,mornay is a little over the top and she
1,the first film was a great example to the movie,the movie was very slow and did n't really do anything
1,if i could rate it lower then 0 i 'd give 0 stars for this film,if the filmmakers had their eye examined or could n't have taken more serious work they probably
1,it 's like watching a lot of other movies and that 's why i watched this movie when you 're on screen i,it is a little bit of one of the most boring movies that have made it to dvd since the original version
1,they are both very similar to this,they did n't need anything else for a
1,the first half hour of the documentary does n't go as planned as i thought it would be,the movie starts with a couple of friends from a family and a couple together a night at the
1,as for the movie i do not remember seeing this film in the theaters it is a very nice film and a real shame because i do n't think anyone could actually be,as a fan for me i was disappointed by the end of this adaptation the story of the family is very simple and not only to the world for their own sake
1,now it is that this is an excellent documentary about an alcoholic who is n't a very deep man,now a few years later i have seen a couple of films of it that i liked from beginning to
1,dear mr who was supposed to be a bit of the comic relief when he was not the one who,dear god i did not even know that i saw this movie at a local theater in washington michigan
1,when one is going on a journey to see the next day,when we finally meet him it becomes that a couple are reunited with
1,while it was in the book and did n't get the name the ending does n't make a big difference it was very disappointing,while most of the scenes were shot on the screen the characters are not realistic but in the film it is quite obvious that they
1,i do remember the scene where the main,i have a fond memory of movies
1,i do know some of you have heard of all the bad ones,i would advise anyone to take the money into renting this movie
1,when the plot is simple the film falls flat,when a movie that is n't great or so bad
1,what a waste for a razzie award nominated film,what does this make up as much as possible is
1,resourceful but it was also not as a whole lot as it seems to,resourceful characters and a plot that is actually based more on character study
1,plus it has the worst movie i 've seen and most definitely not worth buying,plus i do not have much to worry about because i like these movies
1,this is one of those films where the,this is one big waste of time
1,this film is not so much a case as to a,this film is quite possibly one of allen 's best
1,a movie of a high caliber with only one good performance that makes the movie worse,a very sad film of note which is what i expected from a madefortv movie
1,my husband and my son saw this movie with me,my favourite song in the film was one song of the
1,chicago was the best way to end the movie but there 's no denying in a good way to,chicago 's the most recent feature film ever made in a year to come to a new age
1,de niro 's character should never come close as he is supposed,de niro and his wife are all excellent in supporting parts
1,just do n't get me on this crap,just to make you believe it is a horror
1,these characters are so bad they are all very good,these guys just look like they 're making a film with
1,initially the film 's biggest asset is not that the movie is so badly told,initially i did n't care for any kind of logic the first time i watched the
1,the acting is excellent the characters are engaging and the story is,the only problem in me is the lack in my review
1,after the first half of the movie you are not sure whether or,after seeing the movie you can tell that he 's a genius
1,for fans of asian horror films of today i 'd have to say that it was one that would,for example the two young ladies have to take the bait away from each and every other day
1,jason robards is a perfect actor who is one that can have a huge screen career and he is perfect as always,jason robards jr is excellent in his character and it 's fun that he never appeared in the movie and he does what
1,the whole thing is a big dud,the movie was a waste of time
1,we get a lot more information in this film,we have a couple of scenes where the movie opens
1,i had read the book that is the author,i am a big fan of horror film
1,it 's the most fun of all movies,it seems the characters who are the same actors
1,bryan kirkwood and matt dillon do a good job but you can not see how the story line really gets any better you get to see,bryan wilson is the one who really does and is n't the guy who is so bad he just did n't look like a fish
1,it has to rank among the worst and worst films,it 's not even as good as the original
1,you have to be the one to understand that he 's a,you do n't want to make a sequel to this one
1,excellent acting great direction good music a beautiful photography,excellent supporting cast includes john carradine george hamilton and michael
1,so we got the same feeling,so if you 're looking at the
1,this movie also suffers from the same problem,this movie makes the audience feel sorry
1,however i ca n't imagine anyone else like the old lady who is just trying to put this together,however the film is a complete bore and that 's not why anyone gets any better out to me just
1,in fact the characters are just plain awful,in short this movie has a good deal of
1,the script is a very thin and predictable movie full length which was just annoying,the film starts with a guy being attacked by a giant alligator of his son 's
1,if a good movie is going nowhere that 's just a poor idea,if it is n't for the violence of a few more of the scenes
1,pretty lame film with no discernible plot no action no good,pretty good film with good direction and a good cast
1,the story is a mishmash like the one in which the characters play with their characters,the whole show is not funny or entertaining or interesting or even humorous at least not a
1,the only good scenes in this film are when he gets shot with another bullet as much as he did in the first film,the first time the same person was being used the story of the same old woman was not the most famous character in the movie
1,i have n't read the novel that it is based by this site,i saw the movie at the toronto film festival in los angeles and have
1,the movie does have some redeeming qualities,the whole thing has an awful lot to
1,if i was a young man with the right attitude i 'd appreciate it as a kid,if i ever see it anywhere i ca only say that my favourite wife will be a big
1,anderton 's love interest and her husband 's marriage is one of the most heartbreaking pieces of storytelling ever made,anderton the armless and the young man are both brilliant and are the nicest kind of characters in any of the
1,when i saw the movie in the library it was a waste i thought i had heard that was a little bit of an accident and i am a huge movie collector or whatever to write about it and that i really wanted to love this movie,when the movie ends you realize how much you can like it and even then you 've never been a fan of the genre since pulp fiction but still you 're missing it at the end when the end of the movie was really good and the ending
1,films like the thief of frankenstein or the sixth sense in the trilogy are just about as bad as being,films like the exorcist or the grudge and the blair witch project are just as enjoyable as this one
1,if you like movies you should watch this one,if this show had been made in season 1 and
1,although the movie is n't about a group of teenagers in school who get their hands on,although i do n't find the story as much a character i could do very much
1,then to be fair there 's the obligatory action sequence that goes nowhere and the film gets a little repetitive after all,then we have the young guy who lives with his parents and the daughter of a father who comes in to find the
1,if you can manage to see the story of a woman who is in love then who is the daughter,if you 're a big big fan like the original and you want something new in a movie like this one
1,in the end there 's a good reason to watch this movie but the director is just too dumb and is really too lazy,in conclusion i do enjoy this show and i will definitely be a huge fan of the series and am glad i did
1,and the acting is just good,and for those of us that were
1,the plot is very good and some of the scenes that have,the story is simple and there is a few funny twists
1,disney was so successful that the movie makers did n't need to be so stupid,disney is a great character and it always looks like they were on the stage when
1,the only other thing i 've noticed about this movie was that it was made in,the film begins when the hero is a teenager at some stages of his life
1,but then again i would n't have been able to tell a story where the,but if you get the idea the movie is n't about the movie industry
1,as for the movie 's plot i thought it 's good to,as such i 've been looking to see more bad films
1,and of that it 's also quite obvious why this is n't,and the ending is one of the worst of the film
1,the whole film is so funny,the movie has a nice story but
1,when he arrives for a week or so he begins looking for another man,when i got up with my girlfriends to watch it with an extra of friends
1,and then the ending turns into a very lame scene where you see the actors trying the same thing that you have never,and as soon as this movie ended we began to wonder what would we do with our hero in a mental hospital
1,my advice skip this movie in a rental,my advice avoid this movie at your cost at
1,a very good and very underrated film about the man who has a son,a bit but that does mean little too much and is not a complete waste
1,lasts in the world you do not see the film,lasts about 10 minutes and a half hour or so
1,it 's a film to watch with friends but do not watch it at all,it does n't matter for the viewer as to whether it 's the first half of
1,i did n't like it as well as i did,i would give this film a 10 for sure there 's
1,marisa tomei is perfect as usual,marisa 's performance is so bad that
1,the story of this movie is a little weak,the only thing missing is the way the plot is
1,but what it is is a good family movie that is a great,but this is the first all the film that i had seen
1,in fact the only reason why the two films were so successful,in this day the black white gal of the town has been given
1,i was looking forward near this movie and it was only soso,i just do n't know about the plot of a movie but i
1,this film also has a very nice score by paul goldsmith,this is a movie that i could not get through
1,technically this film is really bad the actors are bad,technically you would n't be able to make this film with
1,you are very happy with the story,you 'll love this film you will see
1,making a movie like when the movie is n't a true story but rather the film,making me think that this was the worst part of it but it was still funny watching
1,and there is a very dark feeling about how to destroy the characters as to whether,and it was not for everyone that saw it because the movie was so bad
1,he has done something like this in his life and his life is the same,he 's a good guy he loves to be like you just wanna see him in
1,all the actors look so fake and over exaggerated the actors are just laughable,all the characters are likable and believable yet there are times when there were n't
1,most people have complained that this is a poor,most of this is just a stupid joke
1,and what i got out of this film rescued the entire film,and of the three of them he is a great singer who makes
1,another thing is the lack of the slightest glimmer of humor in the original is the result of a poor attempt at a thriller,another thing i did n't like this movie is the fact that you have a very small group to watch it a couple of days
1,some are very similar with it,some really hard work to get out
1,thanks to the fact the movie was a little over a two hour long length but a lot the actors seemed to be having fun,thanks i for one have the patience to go through this movie with all the negative reviews it 's a great thriller that is worth watching
1,as you might think of the film the acting is excellent,as the movie progresses and the viewer does a good job it
1,towards the end of this episode you are going to be hooked but this is n't the end it was more,towards the beginning of my review i was shocked by the film 's ending but the final revelation left us feeling cheated
1,one of those movies i really enjoyed as a fan and my favorite of the films is,one thing that annoyed me was the fact they were n't really a real horror movie
1,there 's absolutely not enough to make you laugh,there 's just so much wrong with these poor people
1,you do n't get the chance to laugh out loud at the corny dialogue that makes a film such,you know you should n't go in expecting a big budget film because its not the worst film ever made
1,on the other side the film is full of action and the dialogue is really bad,on top of it all it was an attempt at a serious comedy with a lot of
1,it is a very dark film and it 's the first time that it was filmed in black and white it did n't look like it 's a long way home,it was one that had some redeeming features and it really could n't have been done without the gore factor and the music was n't that bad it was just good
1,you know how much of the mystery is lost from your brain,you know that the movie is the only way to go to the
1,the movie is n't the worst movie ever made,the story is a bit of a comedy too but
1,consider his ability to be the ultimate warrior in the world because he has the ability to make a,consider the fact of the matter and there are several things that are quite good about the plot
1,this movie is very funny and it has an interesting plot line and the characters really really feel like they 're doing a,this movie had me laughing at the horrible acting the atrocious script there 's nothing funny or even memorable about these two
1,anyway i ca n't tell you what the film 's about because i have to say that this movie was,anyway he also has a lot to say when he comes to visit that the other members of us
1,everything in the movie screams and the way they do it is very very funny even though the plot and acting never gets old enough,everything in this movie is so good i could never figure out what to expect and it 's one of my favorites a film that has
1,it 's not a terrible film it is about a bunch of friends who go to a cabin in,it 's a very good and interesting view of the relationship between a young girl and a child
1,most of the films are not funny,most of the film is about the family
1,nearly all of these stories are set in different directions than other films and a complete lack in the storyline,nearly a week before its death is a murder mystery that 's just as entertaining as the aforementioned film
1,and the film is just plain funny,and when she gets her first meeting she
1,yes the movie does n't even have all the gore to,yes it 's been a few months in this film
1,as for the plot the acting and the story are great,as such this film was released for dvd and was a lot
1,unfortunately the film is filled only with a,unfortunately this movie is a total waste
1,they are just starting to feel the odds,they are not even close to their standard movies
1,let me get back to the time where we have a movie,let 's take a look at the movie and be entertained
1,i ca ca only be one person to enjoy the show for being so stupid and so stupid and i never knew what 's in the dark and how,i was able not in the face of a film about a movie but about a character i forgot to be one of the actors in which one would have
1,kathleen stanwyck is very good as the title role,kathleen and beth are so much better and this is
1,it has an incredibly predictable plot structure that just makes you wonder who 's going to make a spoof and why the heck did this get to,it 's so obvious to all that that it 's a waste for this stinker of a movie i cannot believe that anyone could like this
1,i could write about a year after this one,i saw this film at the boston international international film
1,this movie is not even worth renting,this is n't a horror story
1,that was my idea that the movie would actually be interesting and funny but that is only one for the big disappointment,that is the problem with that one is that it shows that a man 's life is being destroyed in order to accept
1,the actors all play out as well,the film itself has many of those qualities
1,this film is about a man who,this movie is not for everyone
1,then there are many things to do with it,then the camera moves to some people and i do
1,this movie was not about the war and it did not end,this episode was the best i 've seen in a long long while
1,while this was not the case at night i did n't know why i watched,while the acting was not as good i felt i was in the presence
1,yes there 's nothing funny about this movie,yes it 's not as much a satire as
1,a bit of a movie for my own i will give it 10 out of ten it is not for everyone that needs a,a lot of things that have n't been explored is the acting skills of the cast but it still holds up very early
1,i saw this movie about 25 times and then cried,i do n't care if you do n't even want any
1,interviews with the characters are the most important,interviews are always interesting and the performances by all
1,of course the whole thing is about a girl trying and fails,of course the fact is that it has no plot and that 's
1,obviously he did n't know how to get it but then it 's a little too much of a mess,obviously the director and scriptwriter were just going to try to make a movie about how the killer could turn out
1,rather than the usual stereotype of the story there are a few scenes that just make you question the meaning of life,rather it shows a lot less than it can chew on a level of emotion and even then the movie takes place at
1,on the other hand the movie is very poor,on the other hand if anyone wants to make an
1,nowhere near one of my favorite movies,nowhere else is one redeeming factors
1,the whole film is a total dud from what i 've seen,the movie is pretty good but it really really is n't
1,guys are going to get a kick with the stick on an airplane,guys in the middle ages is a film where everyone seems to get some
1,there were a bit of things that happen in this movie,there 's no real plot the story does n't have anything that
1,the acting is so bad that they do n't even seem as convincing or,the ending was not a bad ending and it was just plain predictable
1,pino oberoi and john cleese play a couple,pino donaggio as the titular detective makes you wonder
1,for a movie like this you will have a very good time watching this,for a movie of this sort of the director is trying his best
1,this is a pretty bad horror film for kids,this film is a great example of how hollywood was
1,it is an excellent film to view,it is the funniest show in the world
1,i saw this on a flight from the library and was in a class of a bad film theater but it turned me off to see it on tv,i was expecting something more than a horror movie but i could n't believe that this movie really made it to the screen because of all the wrong and bad
1,scifi channel was not a film at this time or,scifi channel movies were not always about the war
1,get that one of those movies from a great movie,get ready to have all this and you will see that
1,so what we get here are the two characters the main characters are so,so if you 're looking for a good movie watch something else instead
1,to sum this thing up the whole plot and dialogue were completely believable and the characters were just so cool,to be exact i can forgive all the people that are wrong with this one like a few years before seeing
1,after watching it for the umpteenth time i can only conclude the,after all these years of writing it was an excellent film
1,other notable performances include anthony hopkins william forsythe and ray liotta,other words include some spoilers for the plot i think it is
1,the acting by the two main characters was quite nice and well acted,the characters are not all that likable either that they are too old people
1,when i saw the trailer for i read the reviews i thought that the,when i think about it the whole thing just seemed to fall apart
1,if the filmmakers intended not a serious or negative story that they might have been at the helm they would probably find themselves to take care,if your a bad movie buff or even the connoisseur 's work or even a fan 's film like that you will see how much he loves
1,the film is also a documentary with lots of nudity and sleaze and guts,the acting was bad and i was bored when the movie was released
1,here it goes the same way with the two men in the film,here is an early film that should be viewed as a masterpiece for the
1,music is the main theme song,music is used for a new age
1,the film is filled with the usual clichs that the average movie buff had never,the acting is horrible the plot line has absolutely nothing to recommend this film
1,i ca only say that the main idea of the movie was that it looked like the film was,i had a great day watching this movie it was like an episode of the twilight zone episode
1,while the movie is not about the characters themselves it 's very very good and,while it was an old production it is n't the worst film i saw
1,apparently she never got her comeuppance from being in this one,apparently we do have a little more respect for the camera of
1,the music from this movie was a little too melodramatic but the characters and the situations just plain,the story is simple the acting was great the script is a complete disaster with many twists thrown in
1,while he does n't have to worry that his son his wife will be dead,while he is on the run from his mother there is a lot of things happening
1,ordering your time on the screen with his best friend,ordering the two of them and you 're ready for them
1,to quote the movie i am surprised at this film in my view,to be fair the script is not good and the dialog is terrible
1,within the context and see a very dark and dark movie as the director 's wife who has to make more of these things,within the first 10 minutes of the movie the director decided it would not be too much a shame since the director and writer did
1,based in a novel by stephen rea this story has been told to read about,based on the true events of a book this film is based primarily around
1,this is n't an action movie that 's all there for,this is a great movie it 's a great film
1,it 's a shame that so far is made out in,it makes the movie a little too much to bear
1,i saw this film at the sundance international film festival and it was a good film,i think its not just too bad but it 's a great movie to see and you
1,20 years later she has a baby,20 years ago there are some of the
1,it really does show no emotion for the characters the dialog is,it is like a cross between the two of his shows
1,i am a fan like myself so i do not,i saw this movie when at my annual screening
1,the acting and dialogue are good,the actors have done good performances
1,and then when the first time he gets to the final shot in a bar he does,and the fact is the fact that he is a woman in a car crash with no idea
1,do yourself a favor and avoid it,do not waste your time or money
1,so when i was not sure that there were the other films i can find in it the movie seems like it has been written from another world of films and not so,so when the film reaches that point that it was the only part of it i would watch it was a bit slow and plodding the end is not the worst ever
1,but when it turns out that there 's something wrong in the film,but i could n't find a single redeeming quality of the movie
1,the characters were very well done but the dialogue just seemed,the plot line and the acting are all fairly good
1,searching for the dvd for a good copy of the original classic in the same league,searching for a dvd release of this movie i have to give up on the film
1,if they have made a point it 's an awful show with nothing to,if you liked the movie check out the dvd extras and the soundtrack
1,it 's really a shame that it is n't a movie that makes its impact to anyone who loves it and,it 's not a very good movie it 's not very good though the actors were n't really good either
1,it 's the worst movie i 've watched in a while,it 's a real movie and should be avoided by everyone
1,if not for your consideration this movie just was n't for it as the whole thing,if you 're not a kid like me you will have a lot to think
1,they have a way too few lines of dialog and no character,they all seem like an afterthought but this is not a bad movie
1,it is n't just an action flick that fails on many level,it 's really great how i have to admit that the acting here
1,nothing is wrong but the story line in particular is really good and the actors are all excellent in this film,nothing is even worse with the story of some poor boy from his family and the family he loves them
1,i'm not saying that the movie was made in my opinion because i would like to see a film that is not worth seeing,i'm a bit prejudiced when a movie is reviewed for all these reasons but i still laugh when the film is rated r
1,i was n't too much about the ending i was expecting the story,i had to watch this film because that 's a rare statement
1,on the one hand it 's a,on the other side a lot
1,uma redgrave was a good actress and it had to do with her character,uma kristofferson plays a young girl who wants to be born again in order for
1,the ending is very surprising and so does you know about her life,the whole thing is a little weak and not that bad either it was
1,the only positive thing is the casting,the first movie was very entertaining but it
1,this movie was just plain bad and should have made it even funnier if it was on tv,this is a very interesting and original film from a major studio cast to play their parts
1,her boyfriend also has sex with someone,her character is just a stereotype
1,it is the only film about this story i 've seen and the,it 's hard to believe that someone actually paid for this garbage
1,because of the fact the story is a complete mess in terms of plot or character design it is also a,because the movie is n't really a masterpiece it 's a very good movie for anyone who loves action thrillers
1,the characters are not well defined,the movie is a little long but
1,over the years i 've seen the movie numerous times before and even,over one percent a bunch in an asylum which seems pretty tame
1,the story is quite good the story is intriguing and it 's difficult for you not to know,the plot is a mess a bunch of kids who find themselves stranded in new york and get to
1,i have never been more impressed by a film in my,i am not sure if it is a true art
1,it 's like a movie made from school movies of the 50 million dollars,it was n't that great or the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure
1,gee i am tempted to go for,gee i'm not one of those
1,the whole thing is a dream that makes you question the meaning and the film is about the human spirit,the acting was good and it could be said that the actors were good looking though but that they were good
1,or maybe i just want to see it,or do you think that he is supposed to
1,leung and matthau are great together as the young lovers are in a league,leung is good in this film but it 's hard not to compare
1,this was a great movie and it was great to watch with the,this film is not for everyone who wants something to talk on
1,i had the displeasure of seeing this movie when i was 9 and i was a little sceptical,i was impressed that there was such a good actor out of her and the director did a good
1,also there is not that good reason for,also there are some very good ones
1,easy rider is not a movie,easy rider is a pretty good movie
1,i ca n't wait to see him in anything else but as he went out for some more movies i did,i had never seen any of the episodes which i was hoping for but i was n't really paying too
1,it was a big problem that it would have been better but that was a lot the movie just did n't really flow together,it 's like watching the lion king and his movies as a young man growing in by his girlfriend in an old building on a
1,and i am so impressed with how the movie makes it look so much like the film itself in terms of its setting and its plot and it 's not,and the best of those who are fans of the show and those who have the slightest interest that is the most popular and stupid movie of all ages
1,i 've heard all that they have to do some research but if the film is good i'm sure,i saw the first episode where i heard it was not a sequel but was also very funny
1,burns is one that should not even be forgotten to everyone involved,burns is a young man whose sole strength in life is to be
1,i 've never heard anyone said the same is said in this movie,i did not know what to watch and i could go to the other
1,we had seen an early film where people are not really able and are not,we have never seen so much in the same manner of war in movies
1,there were no good movies about these people,there are many twists that i will not spoil
1,beautiful film about two men who were shipwrecked during a solar war during the early 60 's,beautiful and haunting cinematography and photography is the most vivid aspect of this movie as it stands out
1,and i do think that it 's just great to see a film with a few talented people who would go out to try to make a,and why do we have all of a sudden and sundry little boy who was not as good of a role as i thought that was
1,they 're not as bad as the others but they should all try and convince us that this is a real treat,they are also in the movie for some reason i can not help but love and hate it all the way the story
1,well this was one thing that i can think of,well this is one of the best movies i have ever
1,so i watched it again for free,so in an attempt to make one of
1,in fact you do n't feel like you 're trying hard but you ca n't even find anything to do,in short one should not have to have a good idea of the film because it does not make a lot
1,and if it is that you are the,and it 's not really that funny
1,the acting was atrocious but not that good,the film is not about the life it 's
1,while in the film he has a small role as the woman,while they are not exactly true they are all very real
1,this movie was so bad it makes no sense,this is a film that will not disappoint the viewer
1,his performance by the actors in the film is a perfect,his performance is not the fault he should get here
1,now i'm a fan of the book and my schoolmates and i really like the series too and i have,now this is the story of the girl and his daughter that she 's going through as a child
1,yoko 's character played by ben gazzara,yoko has a heart of gold
1,obviously that was too common to the first,obviously it is a story for adults
1,how can a man that has such powers like this,how about who was going for it to get shot in
1,a very good film in the series,a few times that it is difficult for
1,well let 's start with another scene,well this is a great movie
1,audiences are talking about this film for their kids and adults alike,audiences who have not seen this movie have the slightest attention
1,i am very familiar with it 's content but its still very interesting and not just a story,i could n't believe i was able not to see a movie about this one that was just horrible
1,there is so many unanswered questions,there is a story going on and
1,they are the most important and most of their stories and they are the ones they make love with,they were in the same apartment with this one at a party and you have to be seen at night
1,looking for an example of why someone should see the ending of this mess for the next,looking for a movie that is supposed to be a thriller this one is for you
1,then we 're left with a very funny scene,then a bunch of women find themselves stranded at a
1,even with that in my eyes the film was too boring,even the worst of the films would have been good
1,for all his efforts to get to the point of his career this film would be a waste of his time and money,for those who have never heard of this film i would say the whole thing was very disappointing and made me want to watch
1,its like watching a train crash movie with a,its a pity that it was so popular
1,as a kid this film is a waste and far away worse from the fact this movie does not work,as much a fan as possible and i am sure that all the children were involved but in the movie there
1,i would n't recommend this movie to anybody but if you are a fan do n't waste your time with the,i think the best movie i saw was the one at which we got to the end of our hearts
1,a real treat and this is a film that will not end with the same theme or just do the same with its characters,a good story line to the original series by david mamet and with some of the best actors ever filmed on a show
1,elvira gets her comeuppance with her and her boyfriend and their parents because the girls have been kidnapped,elvira has also been a big star in this movie and she is n't really a bad bad actress
1,ironic it was made in new zealand for the studio,ironic is the scene when a woman 's father tells them
1,but the fact is that it 's still,but that 's about it as far
1,i do n't think it was a waste of talent,i was very excited to read that many people who have
1,however it 's also very interesting to see a movie where you can tell the difference between a,however they did n't have the permission to go down the road with the girl 's house
1,it 's the only thing that the movie is n't,it was great to be able to watch the whole thing
1,but then the plot of a movie like this gets a little boring,but as we learn the truth and the answers that are made in the
1,the film is set in the same building a lot of the early 70 's and,the story itself is very good although there 's plenty to keep you interested throughout
1,we can see his talent from the film and his scenes are well shot,we get the feeling of the people in the family and that the people that
1,the film is filled up with such an implausible storyline,the script is a joke the acting sucks the script is
1,overall though there was a great lack of realism,overall the movie is good but the screenplay is not
1,red dawn of spades was a great movie,red skelton plays a somewhat shy yet naive woman
1,completely unbelievable that the film was actually made in italy and i was surprised to find that it is still a very good movie to watch to see,completely unnecessary that i am aware i 've never found a movie about him that has to explain why he was chosen to make it even better
1,these actors in this film should be proud to be a star,these characters seem real and very much and i really hate that they
1,it is so difficult that she 's just not going for him,it is a beautiful story of a family man who has a difficult
1,the story of course was a good one the acting was very good the story was ok though,the acting is excellent but with the exception of the director and the actors playing his parts the film
1,i was very skeptical about this film as well as the film,i am glad that i'm a big fan to be surprised as is
1,sigh it has the best possible scene in one of my favorite movies,sigh in this movie she is n't just a young woman of the story
1,other people like me say that it is just a bad flick,other than i do n't remember the last time the movie showed this
1,my dad and i both laughed at the movie and the whole scene was laughing,my favourite scene in this film was when the guy in this car is the guy
1,if i remember that i was in the room to watch this and the second story i,if you are going to make this show a series you would watch at least once
1,both are the same kind with perkins,both of them do it well but the
1,the only reason to watch it is because it contains a lot better and,the story is not just as stupid as most of the other characters
1,in the end there is a reason for what they are saying,in many ways the film was a great success to watch
1,i have seen most of the original series from this episode,i was in tears after my eyes and laughed and cried out
1,i really wanted my children to enjoy this movie,i have a feeling that this film was the best
1,kate beckinsale is a very talented actress,kate winslet is in fine form for playing
1,it is n't that good to do,it was all about the movie but it
1,heston 's character and his wife are so annoying that i have never heard a word of mouth and thought it was a,heston plays a young woman caught in her own and the world and her family are forced to choose their own ways
1,unremarkable dialogue in the beginning and a few seconds of sheer violence is an understatement,unremarkable and predictable the film is filled by a bunch of unlikable character actors whose lives
1,the story is simple and the story of the movie revolves around the same age,the acting of the main actress has no character and no chemistry is there
1,it 's so bad it 's laughable but not bad enough for its own bad points at least not for,it 's a real treat to the filmmakers and the people in a different situation in terms of cinematography
1,i was so impressed by it it was impossible to,i was also surprised that this movie was made
1,he was a real character in the first world war,he is not an antihero in fact he does n't know
1,we get to see the actors struggle to survive on it but they all seem completely wasted with the exception,we 're talking to this day of your life and it 's all about all this is what he says to
1,and the final confrontation with a young woman 's father who has been exposed to his wife 's,and then there would be a couple in it that 's all the more fun to see
1,the only thing this movie really got is that you know how many times,the movie is also a very moving portrait on life and human nature
1,by contrast the two leads are very good and it is clear that they are n't just misunderstood because of the film,by today 's standards it was very refreshing even if you were n't expecting to enjoy this series in the first place
1,the plot has the same tired formula that you would expect and it has no continuity,the acting and the plot is pretty bad as is what i do n't know
1,i thought this film may be a disaster,i could n't have been more wrong
1,needless to say the director did n't seem interested in the fact he 's the character and that he could n't even come across more so,needless to say it would have had one that would have made it a little more serious to see the director of the original show
1,for the record i am aware that the movie would n't have lasted a couple of years,for a while i am looking up on the couch to watch the movie is in its prime
1,well this time we learn a thing about,well done and i really liked it
1,cinema is a movie and this movie did n't do anything at the box it was so awful,cinema is a great action flick but the actors do very good in their roles as well
1,first of all you have to give this game its props,first of the film is set against a black castle in a
1,the first scene is a nice touch to show,the story line about a young girl named lena is
1,you 'll never get a chance,you can be a pretty good filmmaker
1,the characters are just as interesting as the film in the first film so if they,the whole thing is just a bunch of kids trying to get to the bottom
1,maybe the acting and directing were not good or bad,maybe i'm just thinking about being too close to my own
1,charlton nachle is about as fun as it gets,charlton jovi is the perfect villain for the role of
1,a lot of the movie takes place in the present day where a little girl is being chased raped by a car accident,a few films do n't have it that the director could have chosen as a movie and it is a total waste of time
1,and the scene of the giant monster walking on a horse and you see what he is trying to eat the other is n't a great idea but he is still in his prime,and then there 's that scene in which the hero tries to stop the woman who the killer is so obviously a bit of a jerk in the first place to be able into the
1,pretty much one can only imagine this,pretty maids are not really like
1,his character was so unlikable the acting was terrible,his portrayal was pretty interesting and his character
1,if only a movie could have been shot with better acting and editing so what,if that were to be revealed then this is an important story to watch
1,apart with a little bit of the usual nudity that is n't too much to recommend this one,apart they made it seem that the writers had tried too much to be so clever and so did
1,it was the first time i saw that movie when in the first film my friend had to watch,it has the feel of a great movie that i enjoyed but it could have been much better if it
1,this film really was so predictable it 's not funny,this is the one i 've heard in a cinema
1,the movie is a lot better for the film itself to watch as it is an excellent film with a message to it,the movie is not a bad movie and it is not in the same way with the original but it 's just too goofy
1,yet this time you get in the way,yet it was also fun and interesting
1,some good actors were killed but in the end i thought this would be a really bad movie if it was not a horror movie,some of the dialogue in this movie was a bit overdone but i was surprised that it was not as good as it should
1,or maybe it was just the same plot,or maybe it 's a bad film
1,laura linney 's character is a hoot with her little screen presence,laura linney gives a strong performance she was excellent in this movie
1,that 's why i liked watching an episode of this movie,that scene is so boring so unbelievable even so much
1,plutarco who is not in his family has lived in the past of living his family and his,plutarco is not very interesting and is a really nice guy who is so much better looking
1,the story itself was so weak that i was really annoyed at what was happening to,the acting is good though but not the best of the series or the series
1,as for it i thought it would be good but it still is n't good or funny,as a result of this film i really could understand the problems of a lot more
1,his character is played by a very,his wife is very good too
1,as for the rest i was surprised,as for the plot the film is pretty
1,the movie is a masterpiece of the original,the acting was awful although i think a lot
1,i really wish that the dvd would be released in the us at the same time as it did,i had heard that this was a movie and it would have never been done much better in many ways
1,penny 's character is one of the best movies i have seen,penny 's performance was so bad that he 's really hard to believe
1,it is n't an easy task at all to be seen and to be more specific with it 's own merits,it is a bit odd to be able to see how they have gotten out of the car crash on the beach
1,the story of a teenage woman with a very troubled husband in the movie was really interesting,the director is constantly attempting too much to make us feel like what he was going to do
1,aamir 's character 's personality was just as much as we could have been,aamir keitel gives a wonderful performance and he gets a chance to see it through
1,but i have to say i am biased enough to appreciate,but the real story is a bit of a mess
1,failure is one of the better ones,failure to have some laughs but they can
1,the film is an extended piece of trash,the acting is awful and the characters
1,freeman is perfect as a detective and in the middle of a series we 're dealing,freeman 's character is in a coma as a human and a tragedy to get
1,as with most movies i saw this one,as a result of the story and the story
1,i love to think this will be a cult classic because of his excellent,i was n't even trying to make it out of a tv movie
1,carface as a cop who is supposed to be,carface does n't appear to like this one
1,i ca n't imagine anyone could see,i had to watch this movie
1,i had to shut up at the tv and decided that i could predict that it was in a similar vein and not,i think that if the show had a lot more money and it shows than the show it is a great show
1,in a small town she 's a rich man,in a way it is an excellent film
1,he makes up his screen with the exception of dr john baker who gets involved in his death at the beginning of a movie which does not really have any action scenes to tell,he then gets himself involved in the story of a man who 's the daughter of the father of the deceased and the man who was also a great fighter that is not the most
1,malcolm piper 's script and other comments of his victims are so awful that,malcolm macdowell is as always an awful actress and is a good actress
1,the first thing i noticed was the ending,the actors are n't the best at that but
1,imagine this one is like watching a live movie,imagine the story to see a more realistic version of
1,sniffing the popcorn and then be knocked out the toilet for no reason at the end when the movie is going nowhere and i have no clue why,sniffing off of the first episode you would have much more fun to watch the show but with its unique humor and subtle humor from that time and a
1,overall the movie was worth the rental and i think that if you are,overall an excellent story and an excellent example of the film 's genre
1,steve martin 's role as a woman is priceless,steve brodie looks like a nice and lovable guy with
1,it was the fact that the entire film was filmed on location,it is a great story told from both perspectives and the acting is
1,despite its shortcomings it might have been the perfect opportunity for,despite its flaws the film still has no redeeming feature
1,the first half hour of a movie about a girl is really,the acting is so amateurish and so predictable its almost painful
1,sure the plot is very original but it,sure he 's supposed something for you
1,i saw this film in the late 70 ole as a free film at the age of 13 a few years after the release was shown in the,i have to confess that i was really bored with the movie for the first time and then the other half was n't quite funny at all
1,some may have been a bit too young to be able at the theater but,some people who have not heard better things is the movie they are doing
1,and he had the worst line ever,and there was a nice touch of realism
1,this is definitely the best of the bunch,this is the most important piece of work i
1,how did we see a movie that,how can they go into it
1,a woman named carl goes to a doctor to see,a good example is the way they 're treated
1,the plot was n't too good,the story is that of a bunch
1,the only real reason i watched it is because i'm tempted to bet the film is just trying to get my approval back as the director of some of these scenes are quite literally,the only reason i gave the movie 10 out of 10 is because i was expecting a movie that had the potential of a story that kept me guessing to the point of needing my
1,this episode shows what can happen on a friday morning when you need to have a child movie,this would be my first comment on a good dvd that i 'd rather go see but the second
1,david lynch was an american film star on a set of,david morse makes a great villain as the evil villain
1,the first half of the film focuses in,the acting was bad in this film
1,anyway i was expecting something more,anyway a man who thinks they do
1,it is just a simple story told by many of us,it 's not a movie and i wo n't give it away
1,this has to rank on a movie to say this is the worst movie ever,this film has a lot of great action sequences and a fantastic supporting performance
1,the only redeeming feature of it is the scenery and the music which helps this film,the script is a mixture of the classic the excellent vincent price and jack warden 's the
1,her father and a child and the two are reunited with their friends,her only purpose lies to her being the mother who gets in her way
1,i do n't recall having this movie but it is n't even worth a look if you are in the,i do n't really have an answer why this film does n't have to rate for a few reasons
1,at first im wondering about any of,at least that movie was better
1,it 's a lot of fun,it was a pretty good idea to
1,some parts were quite nice and had some nice acting by the actors,some might complain about the acting the story but it 's very good
1,there is no real reason for this movie,there is so few films in this world where
1,if there 's a chance to see this film it is,if you love this type you probably will be disappointed
1,probably the worst i can ever get out of the shower scene where he has to leave the film with a long monologue,probably the only thing i can remember that was that the movie was so bad i could n't help but laugh and i loved
1,as usual it 's a shame that such films are never released,as for all of its shortcomings it would be the film to make
1,suddenly it turns out it is all very important and interesting but then there,suddenly the film takes its toll and its subject matter of its title
1,unfortunately the whole point seems to be to make fun of,unfortunately the main character seems to be so much a caricature of
1,the whole thing is just a complete dud,the only one who has actually had good roles
1,imo there 's a lot for the film,imo i have not seen the first two of
1,i could n't imagine myself believing that it would have been so easy,i saw this movie last saturday on television and it was so good that
1,hyper inaccurate and unnecessary story telling the viewer to watch a film which is so bad,hyper speaking in this movie the director and producer do not even get a sense to the
1,it was the funniest film out on the whole,it was n't really really that bad of a lot
1,the only thing that i ca n't,the script and script was great
1,and that the movie has its share,and it does n't really matter
1,i thought it was too much,i was surprised to see one of
1,the main character was killed by a giant spider and,the only thing this film has is the score
1,totally unrealistic and the most disturbing character ever gets killed,totally unbelievable story about a young girl who works for her
1,next time i will give you a good example but i am disappointed,next up in the world of course and a bunch of people that have
1,with these two films i would have seen it at my local video store and was not impressed,with all the faults we have to say to you in that it was n't a bad movie it
1,however this movie is a bit of the same on my personal,however for a low budget movie it is not much better
1,the film is not a movie in terms but it is a film that is worth catching,the film was n't even the first one and the director was just as bad with this
1,she plays a tough girl to a tee and she is able to get married,she is a woman who is very attracted and so on and so on and by
1,copying a few of these movies and a film is an example of how the movie is in the book,copying a film about the evils of a war on the wall a movie that would never be viewed or on
1,the only problem this movie has is that it 's,the acting of the three leads is very bad
1,i was n't surprised to see that they had a great deal,i saw this film and i thought it was very good
1,i saw the sneak spiral of this one,i would like to see the movie again because
1,it 's not bad but it 's not,it 's the story 's a real life it
1,i was very disappointed with the acting for this film,i have n't seen this show since but i 've always
1,if one knows about it i will be honest,if you 're looking at a movie with a little
1,i 've seen better acting in a porno movie and the plot line is pretty bad for a thriller and i do n't think that it was supposed to do,i am not an expert of this movie as a film but the message that was in the film is the question of why it is the case with the story
1,although i 've always been a huge movie fan i am a huge admirer myself,although the plot seems to have been made in the middle of nowhere by the actors
1,if he is to do what he can,if only it is a good film
1,i am not a huge movie buff but it was a waste of time and time to watch,i ca n't really describe how much more of this film had to do so than the other reviewers
1,the only one of them is the most annoying kid in,the whole thing just makes you feel uncomfortable and depressed
1,the movie is just a vehicle,the main character 's father was a
1,i really hope she will continue a sequel soon soon,i was a fan that the writer and writer of the
1,the script is great with the usual clichs and acting that i have n't yet mentioned so the movie is about a bunch,the director is also in a very tight position and he takes a different approach that allows the viewer to understand whether the movie
1,they even try to make a point in,they were the most talented actress ever
1,how the movie got a theatrical release in 2003 makes this,how much money can he go through the time warp
1,i 've watched it countless many more times now,i was not expecting much from this movie
1,instead they are merely trying too hard and it,instead it 's a complete waste of film
1,two words that i have to describe for this movie 's success i ca n't wait,two men a boy who comes across a house with a child and a mother
1,23 years later the movie starts to fall apart,23 minutes long and you have to see the movie
1,it was also a bit of a rip off with an allstar cast but it,it is a pity that a couple other films are such a classic masterpiece
1,forest patrol was an extremely powerful story about the life,forest whitaker is very good here as the other
1,so it gets you a bit of a chuckle about it but in my opinion it 's more fun to see than this,so if not the least bit of the film is that it does n't matter and the ending is a bit rushed
1,this makes this show more fun to have than the average cartoon show i 've seen,this is one of those movies where the director has a very small cast who did n't
1,dominick is a true talent for all of us who want his to go on a,dominick is a good guy who wants him to get a job at a game
1,ivor coscarelli was not only a huge,ivor novello is an absolute delight
1,the movie itself was an extremely good film and in this case it has become one of my favorites,the story line was bad but for some reason you just did not care about any of the characters
1,this is a wonderful movie with excellent animation great,this movie was so funny i actually laughed
1,but in the beginning he does not take a single seat of the,but then you know it would n't go from an easy job
1,if they are in the same state of mind as the other two films i would have been looking,if you like these two and you 'll love this movie i recommend you give it another chance
1,the movie also makes us feel about the main character 's plight,the only real good thing i can add is the way the character
1,the movie starts with a very promising premise of the events we see about a girl in the middle of a road accident with a child,the whole plot seems like a bad dream movie but the plot is very simple and the acting is horrible especially with the two leads
1,since the original version of the movie is very much the most original of them as the first movie i was impressed with the ending so you just feel,since i had a friend and sister of my wife 's boyfriend and i did not like to watch her i just found she played the lead character
1,but the movie is n't worth the time and effort i 've had,but that 's not what is missing in the film which means the film
1,let 's get to that point,let my guard watch this film again
1,fyi if this is your typical scifi movie you,fyi the film has a very attractive look
1,in conclusion i would recommend it if it has to be on any level of a collection,in one scene the hero says she 'll kill him and then kill a child but the woman
1,the plot is quite simple but in short doses of the,the first time i saw this i was really impressed
1,really bad movies are a good thing because he really,really i was n't impressed when the movie ended
1,in addition to the title of this film the movie was made with a certain,in the movie he meets her mother in the very beginning of the movie
1,did you get a chance for a movie that had a good storyline,did he think he 'd be a great choice for making this
1,it 's just a little silly that the characters never actually make sense,it is not a movie in that it is very realistic and so it
1,zap in my opinion is the most,zap is a very funny film
1,all in all it makes a good impression on,all in this film was a lot different
1,the ending and the ending is great the main characters go to war and the end of a world war ii,the movie opens up like a dream where all of the students are the only good things about this movie
1,if you 're a fan do yourself a favor and do the dishes,if you have a problem with the movie i 'd say it 's a
1,the first time i saw this movie was in tv,the film 's story is a very simple one
1,well done i 'll just say that when watching,well this movie did n't make an iota
1,the movie is about the love triangle between,the movie is a waste of talent
1,i was impressed that the film made me laugh for the first,i love this movie and i do n't recommend this film
1,the film starts out with a very slow pace and then it 's revealed in time of all of the characters and story,the acting is a joke but this is one of my favorites to have an appreciation for a good movie and i can tell
1,i had to watch this movie to try and catch myself in disbelief that is the best way to describe,i could have done without that if they had a better script and better direction but i just did
1,one of the finest films i have ever watched and i still,one day i saw the movie and did n't expect anything
1,if you 're looking to watch a movie like this get on on this one it,if you like the kind they could not have done a good job with this
1,a very entertaining performance in this movie that makes a lot more sense,a group of college student students get involved in a car accident which leads
1,it 's a shame on every conceivable,it is a very good story
1,this movie has the same sort of humour,this movie makes me feel bad for people who
1,i am a huge hollywood reviewer and this movie is very entertaining in parts,i do not know how people will think a movie like these is an amazing
1,if you are a fan of the series you are missing something you 'd be right up to a time in your lives,if you 're looking for a movie about the evils of war it is the movie to watch and you will be disappointed if
1,for all this movie the action sequence of characters just are not funny or,for this is a very good action thriller and a good solid film
1,instead it makes a mockery of a series of murders and the story is very well done and,instead you are shown how many people can identify with each other in a very different way
1,herbert shields is a fine actor and is excellent as always,herbert lom stars but a real standout character actor i have ever
1,he should have been a little larger with his own and a better cast,he has done so well here and so many people have forgotten his story and
1,that 's why the film 's final analysis is,that was so much fun and in general
1,they 've been in love with a woman and they all know that,they were in it to see what a good movie they were
1,then when i first heard about the movie i was a little hesitant to,then the film switches to the climax where one would just like this
1,i ca n't wait to watch and enjoy the movie,i ca n't believe that a director who actually got into
1,except it 's a real stinker if anything it 's the best of the bunch,except for a few scenes they also are so annoying that they ca n't even make
1,the film is a classic for a,the story is just so bad
1,certainly there 's nothing that has a good story line,certainly this should be a good reason to watch it but
1,ok so i saw some episodes that have been done so far better,ok i know how i 'll be able to suspend the disbelief but that
1,it was one of the first movies,it 's a lot more fun
1,in that way it 's a very interesting film and very touching,in fact it 's the best of its type of cinema history
1,there 's an odd truth that is not to,there is no real plot or story development
1,the main characters the characters are the actors are,the whole movie is really just plain boring
1,from a few years ago the british army is sent into an american prison to assassinate the world,from the opening sequences to the first shot and the beautiful scenery in a scene we have to wonder
1,these guys have a great deal of screen time and it shows that they could n't have been more than just that,these two people are not good the bad guys are good and it 's not bad at all but you really feel like
1,tarzan the heretic is a movie about the life of an astronaut who was killed by some,tarzan looks like a bad imitation of his typical zombie mask as well a complete ripoff
1,speaking like an english play i am appalled at how bad,speaking of the story this film is just as bad
1,recommended if not for all of this 's brilliance for the sake,recommended for fans of the genre and those who have seen the original
1,this is by far my absolute favorite movie with no hesitation,this is a wonderful film in the same sense of humour as
1,death is a very long term,death bed and blood gore are the
1,if you want to get married and want to find out why they want to go to,if you 're looking at something like a horror classic this may be a great movie
1,i did enjoy this movie and had to watch the whole movie,i did n't expect it in my area but the movie is a
1,while it 's obvious it has n't really been a great movie i would recommend renting,while he 's a bit rough in places he looks like a very old person
1,so many of these ideas are in the script as it would be a shame to read,so what 's the difference is that in the end of it 's first two hours we get
1,i did feel sorry about this film at all but this just seemed so,i was n't sure what to do with a movie i did not
1,the main characters are not developed properly,the first two of the films feature the
1,diamond 's only friend has to deal with,diamond 's life in a different place
1,when i heard about it my mother and i were watching an episode that aired and,when the film 's plot is told the film is set on a fictional island
1,but when this man has to go to the local bar he ca all,but the film is very bad in fact its just so poor so poor that
1,was she trying desperately to be funny,was it a dream or if a movie
1,so the story is not as simple a film about a young woman who,so they get to the island to take up an old abandoned couple
1,finally i would recommend seeing this,finally there are a lot of great
1,the movie itself was not as bad as it was but the acting was so good,the only thing missing is the fact that she plays a spoiled teenage male who has a
1,pointless scenes are used in the first half of my film that i have seen for no longer so long as i have to watch every more,pointless dialogue is so obvious that the audience is constantly aware that a bunch of teenagers are having sex but it 's just that they do n't really
1,no other actor in the movie was a,no one could have seen them before
1,there are two things that have made you feel that your life is your,there were also lots of other parts which are not all quite amusing
1,and it will always work better off sticking on and the movie,and that 's about the only good thing in this movie to the
1,both were very good and i have no problem with them at,both have some of the best scenes i have ever read
1,it 's also a great movie but the acting is not very memorable either as there are so many parts where the actors have no real talent and the film just,it is a bit odd as the movie is so dull it is hard for those of us who like films to see the truth that a film should be
1,this is the only movie i have seen in my whole while that was the worst in any case,this show is a perfect candidate for any film lover and i have never seen one of those films
1,the movie was so awful that i had a headache and a friend in an hour,the ending is so horrible that you feel like you were watching a movie that could have
1,because i have just been watching this show over and watched a couple of episodes from,because they had to be in the movies at least a little of the time
1,he was n't just one part,he is a quiet man who has
1,then after the first hour of the film it 's clear the filmmakers were trying to pull out the movie the way they tried to make a statement,then i watched this movie because i was on the cover for 3 or 4 years before i had seen it i am a huge fan the film is
1,i had no complaints on how good things would happen if,i think that 's the key element of this film
1,but the story is so complex and its good,but the fact of this film is the fact they
1,that 's not the case with this movie and it 's not a good one,that said if this was a movie it would have been a lot better than it
1,this is a movie of a group of men who have been living in the past of israel after living on a small,this is a very entertaining movie a lot of fun a great cast and a good supporting cast a very good job
1,the only reason i watched the entire series was to see if they can find it and have no qualms,the acting is great with the exception of the young actors in this movie is so good as to the fact
1,in my opinion i did not like the film because i found it to be very boring,in this movie the actors give the story to a young child prodigy who has a very difficult
1,and i 've seen a number of the horror movies made that i 've loved,and the ending in the middle of the film was so disappointing it was actually funny
1,in addition to his character he is the only survivor that seems to have been a part on,in one of the most interesting movies i ever saw this is one i 'll see again
1,no one seems so dumb that it is impossible to imagine what he was doing but he was just plain stupid as the film,no one can deny that the only reason we do n't is that we are not so young is that the film does n't get
1,then you go to the movies,then there 's a scene which is
1,there are many characters who seem to be in,there is no real threat to this movie
1,not one single instance in the entire film is a bit of a plot it is very long and boring it 's,not only is the music atrocious but for a movie it is pretty dull and has a lot better to do
1,the acting was good but the script was so weak,the acting in these two films are not bad but this
1,larry 's evaluation is a very funny film about a young,larry is one thing you can do in the world
1,the acting is terrible except i did n't know who the real,the movie is not just a drama about what he wants
1,but there are no other things to,but it was so much better
1,first we 're going through the entire spectrum,first of that i did n't think i was
1,rough and depressing the action scenes have a lot to do to get,rough as you can tell that it is a very poor movie
1,a lot better then the original series,a must see for fans of the series
1,the film is a very moving depiction,the only redeeming feature in this movie are
1,with my favorite part of a short series this time i could n't,with a better budget it could have worked for a movie called
1,if i was in my late 20s or 40s i 'd probably never know,if you have not seen this you 'll enjoy it for the pure silliness of
1,anyone can learn of this film as if it was made with the right amount,anyone familiar with the original will be pleased with the idea of a remake
1,ennio morricone plays a very handsome and ambitious man who is sent to a mental institution after,ennio morricone 's direction is superb in his film especially at the end of his career
1,it is very rare that it is not available in video format,it 's a movie i could only watch again with my friends on
1,astro is at best a typical action comedy that takes a bit too much for those who are tired of action films,astro daughter is not a good actress and her performance is a bit too mature to be the actress i have seen
1,i'm sure it 's a good deal of the time,i'm sure they 'll come back with that kind of movie
1,absolutely the worst movie i have ever watched where i felt that the movie was not,absolutely nothing has been done to the hilt or the original series that was written
1,i have never seen an asian version so far as one could say but i have n't seen it on tv since its last release,i have to say this i do agree a lot to say that this was a pretty good movie even when the first sequel was bad
1,shots of the ship being chased in various rooms,shots of the film being shot in a studio 's
1,oh and a scene where she goes off on an airplane in the woods and gets hit by two gallons of,oh yeah the movie was pretty bad so i guess that movie was a lot better than what i expected
1,or perhaps he has to come up on his own and to find,or the one we have no other way in the entire movie
1,now this film was shot in england,now that the film is on the whole
1,it 's a pity that i found this series quite a disappointment,it 's an insult that you can find an attractive woman in a
1,in the early days i was not surprised and wanted to be in the theater,in this case it looks like a bunch of kids who have nothing but contempt for
1,he was not even a great director but that his film,he was the only reason to give it a try
1,a lot of the jokes are just funny,a movie that should have been banned on dvd
1,the story is simple and the story just is n't compelling but not as good as the novel,the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the presence of the lead role in her performance
1,ok i 've read a lot that there has never come out a lot more,ok i can say this about the worst film i 've ever heard it was so
1,billie barrymore is in the first ten years,billie is a very attractive girl and does her
1,it was a good time to make,it 's a very good performance
1,furthermore the actors did n't look like a very convincing person,furthermore the script is so lame that i was compelled myself to
1,there was a lot more time spent of the story line,there was no sense of real danger and the movie was very
1,surprisingly a movie like this one can be very different from the others,surprisingly this film is the worst and worst of them all the worst movie
1,it was n't a good thing,it is a very beautiful movie in
1,the only problem is that they are both in control that way and that 's about the only,the only good thing about this film however is that he makes it seem like an eternity
1,that 's why i give it two out,that 's how much i loved him
1,true love and hate it is a perfect place to start and watch movies like love and friendship but do not forget this one it is n't,true it 's not the worst film of any genre but in all departments it is certainly one that really should have been left on the shelf on
1,hearing this film is a very good example for one person who loves this movie and is not fond to see it just for the,hearing the words from this movie is the only part of this film that will make you think that the story is going nowhere
1,they all look like they were in the middle of,they could have pulled the rug from his friend
1,on the plus side the costumes were excellent and a bit eerie,on the other hand if you do you 'll be a much better
1,just do n't watch it and i 'll say,just do n't expect the original dracula ii
1,if you do n't know what it is you would have to watch,if you 're looking at a movie you have the wrong movie
1,the story is based on a true story,the acting was terrible and i thought was just
1,did they know they are n't going for anything remotely original,did i not want to go to see this movie
1,what does not happen is that you,what the heck does he do
1,i'm surprised that this is not the case with this film as i would not have seen it,i'm giving it 7 because it does have more parts that have to offer to a few more chuckles
1,rowlands 's role as one of our characters has a very difficult task,rowlands 's character had a very strong idea and she was so convincing
1,it 's almost as great as this and,it was funny to watch this movie
1,it 's a shame that this movie has only been,it 's not even the worst kind of film
1,miss barrymore 's character is one that has an affinity to the book,miss boone is an excellent film with great acting and a great cast
1,etc but i can say it is a great film and a mustsee,etc i 've heard of this movie so bad you can only guess that
1,they were both the original in this film,they have the same kind of character who in
1,still it 's still not too good but still a very good film if it,still you ca quite a movie that is a bit too much for me
1,one of the greatest movies ever made,one of the better scenes is the part
1,the muppet movie' should be ashamed of it 's own,the big mayer was the best and most touching of the
1,it seems that every person that has watched this movie can relate them to it,it 's also a really great movie which is not one of them is the film
1,and it has been a big mistake since the original,and it 's just about all the other cars
1,or the most memorable scene was when the two main protagonists meet a pair member,or when you 're having a great movie in the background the characters are so well
1,the movie has an upbeat plot,the film is about some young girl
1,i thought it was quite amazing,i saw the first episode of this
1,this is the perfect movie for kids,this movie is a very good example of
1,sort of like a tv show,sort the story has been told by
1,of the many great horror movies i have ever been interested this was one that just took a good deal to set the standard in the genre for decades,of course the whole idea of making a movie to be as good as the books can have it but it takes too seriously to make it look like it
1,of course you ca n't say any movie buff in the world or the others and i think they were trying too many,of its era that i was expecting to get in for the second season or some other show i 've seen it on a
1,heathcliff is very much more than a comedy that takes place during a very serious time,heathcliff and the fact this movie was made in new york was n't all that impressive and
1,the plot is pretty standard the premise has the potential to develop a bit more than some of these things,the acting in this movie sucks it 's so awful that the movie does n't even seem like any other movie
1,the actors are also very well cast in this piece,the movie has a very long list to the movie the
1,also the film itself is a very interesting view,also you are supposed to like the ending
1,i ca n't even begin to describe how,i have seen better acting and directing
1,despite the low rating for this flick in the imdb rating it has to have to rate higher than most reviews,despite the fact this is a bad movie for kids i really like this movie for some reasons but i ca n't
1,i do not even understand the appeal that this film has and,i have not read the book yet this version comes close
1,i think that you could watch a film for this type of thing,i had to watch this film because i was in the mood of the
1,this is a very good movie,this movie could be the only one
1,i have watched a lot of films and i was really shocked to learn it,i do not recommend a movie like the plague to see that this film
1,the actors of this show are the best i have ever seen the characters are perfect,the movie is set for the sole battle at all but the story is not really a
1,if you 're a fan of the 80 and 70 's you 'll want to see this movie and decide to check out the book,if the director had a good idea of the director 's work this could have had a bit of an impact on the film but this
1,this is not only an indie movie,this show was a great show
1,the first and third film was so bad it was painful to watch,the film begins with a group and one winged guy and some deformed lady
1,james coburn 's character could not come close of what he was in this film,james mason played the role of a young man with a heart who has become a
1,his portrayal has also given the film some of,his portrayal of the character was n't believable
1,the film begins with several people trying and the first is an ordinary conversation,the film is about the journey in the life of all involved in the present
1,even though the film does contain many of the characters you will not,even the most ardent zhang fan has n't seen his other work
1,lord and jury is no ordinary or interesting,lord john is the only movie he really does
1,millionaire the movie looks like it came out at the time of the 80 something where the action scenes are shot,millionaire in the middle third of the movie is a woman who has to be the biggest man to get her to
1,what more can you possibly rely around,what i liked is the performances by these
1,naturally i found myself wanting a good story line with a good plot twists and good characters all along,naturally they get the chance to make another decision from another couple and they try to get to the island
1,dylan ladd is good as usual as,dylan mcdermott is an exceptional villain
1,most of that is good too but the movie,most people will be disappointed by this one
1,star trek episode 1 episode 1 episode 5,star trek 's episode 2 the final showdown is
1,reasonable story and action scenes and some good fight scenes in the movie,reasonable movie with a very interesting plot and interesting characters make it worth waiting
1,0 and 2 the acting was n't bad,0 the movie itself is very good
1,he 's an amazing actor in a nutshell and he is a great actor and an incredible actor,he is a fine director who has worked with several other directors for the art of animation
1,presumably the director had a good time and it was n't even a very funny movie,presumably he is being the only one who has had a problem since he did n't seem
1,another thing i noticed was that i felt,another movie about the holocaust 's world
1,there are no good songs just a couple of scenes that do n't fit well with the plot,there was no need that one scene where a few of the guys had to face the whole thing
1,of the few films out on these days it was still great at,of all the actors the director was the producer of the show
1,that said the film has a good cast a nice script and,that 's about my personal experience of what was going on
1,at one time he 's talking a little about what to happen,at this point i thought that maybe this was an intentional movie with
1,cute and interesting in parts in a film that will appeal for any,cute little kid and the girl are a nice touch to behold
1,patrick carrol jr as the chief has a,patrick warburton plays the father very hard
1,i was in the right frame when i saw the trailer cover which has been done so many of the movies i,i 've got it in the film and i think i 'll give a good deal of advice to the film
1,there are many great songs that is very catchy,there 's no need to remake any other story line
1,the whole film is set up as a means for some reason but in reality it is just a jumble for,the movie is not as bad as they could have been but there was some gore and some nice visuals
1,what 's up tiger are also just a bunch of people walking through the camera and shooting the camera to bits and pieces,what i liked the most if not to be warned was that the first part of it was so bad it seemed like it
1,it is a very sad film and not even a complete waste of time it is a movie about people who do not have much,it is a great story great acting awesome sets a lot of good humor a lot but i ca all think about being good
1,it was so horrible and so terrible,it does n't have the feel good action
1,hellworld is one thing to be done,hellworld would n't make much sense
1,populist acting is all there to deliver the plot,populist liberties with the story of a man who has
1,i 've never seen that movie again on tv i ca n't even tell,i have n't done anything else on the subject of a crime movie
1,explosions are all pretty much the same,explosions are always a step above the average
1,idiot to be a young man on the street is a good cop who,idiot 's wife is a very poor character and she makes no sense
1,although there is nothing special for an action movie i found something in it to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable if only for a very,although i found it pretty hard to watch the movie it was very well acted and it was n't very good but not bad
1,not only that it has the most powerful of his films,not only does this mean that he wants to get his money
1,in fact the only way this movie could be good is that the director did n't make a decent film,in fact it is so bad it 's like watching a high speed video game on a train station
1,give us something like nothing to see,give her another movie that she should n't
1,also some of the scenes between him and his son,also the movie is not in the same league
1,and that 's saying a word i have to say that you 'll find that,and it will be a shame that the movie was never released to theaters
1,but then i have to admit that i ca all about this film in a theater,but the story is really really awful and a total waste of money and money and time
1,the movie has very nice scenery and the cinematography is fantastic but the special effects are also very few as well as it 's the story,the plot is very simple but there is also some really funny scenes and the whole movie is a perfect example of what happened on the screen
1,it 's also one of the first of its kind to be released in 2007 and it 's,it 's a fun time capsule of the era where it can only be described as such
1,telling your friends what it 's like watching a family,telling of a story and a few moments of suspense you
1,it was a good thing when you got to see it,it seems that this movie was written directed by a lot of
1,swope is a bit hypocritical but there 's something that he does n't want to be in,swope is an alcoholic for his own good and we have no idea about his future
1,yet i must say it was an incredibly good movie,yet the movie is a mess of a story
1,i saw the trailer and thought it was a great episode,i do n't know how it came in the middle of this
1,3 the ending of the movie and a few words,3 the film 's only flaw of the film is the
1,as the movie progressed the two men were at the top,as for the story i really did enjoy the movie
1,we had an idea that we did just like it,we get to see her in a small role in the
1,whether or not he did it he did n't have to make any of it even if he did n't want him to,whether or a bit of interest or not it 's worth a watch especially if you 're an admirer of the original
1,the story is not very good,the movie is very slow moving with
1,the script of this movie was very very funny,the cast is good but the script just keeps getting
1,that is what this film would have been proud to have,that 's not a good thing in fact it 's not that
1,spoiler ahead i 'll admit that the first time i watched,spoiler alert i do n't know how to make movies
1,unfortunately the film 's plot is as follows in the first film but the,unfortunately for a bunch he does n't even come in as an actor
1,on the dvd extras the interviews were filmed by the actors as well because the director was able to convey the,on some level the film 's direction is a little slow and hard to follow since the acting is horrible
1,unlike this and even fewer films like this one that were n't,unlike many of the other comments this movie is pretty good
1,kline and his colleagues do n't even look like a giant head,kline was a real actor in fact a film like this and his
1,if you 're looking to find a good movie with good actors or good,if you have not seen this film you will not regret the movie
1,i think everyone is interested with it or just do n't know why i do n't have this one,i would be lying with my friends with my dad in this film who is the main reason to watch
1,however they were at least a little smarter than it 's predecessor,however if you are one of those actors who is a real fan
1,kirsten dunst is a fine director who 's not as talented director either,kirsten dunst plays a spoiled mother as she is being torn down by one
1,this movie is the worst of it all bad,this movie will not be one to miss
1,i have n't mentioned the film,i had a high hopes and was
1,i really liked this movie because it is so incredibly sweet,i had never heard of her before i was watching this film
1,taker does n't care about his friend or what they are or who 's in his next line,taker and his friend and their father are in the neighborhood of a small village and they are given
1,the movie does n't really have the budget you would think in the same day when you watch the film,the movie is about the lives in the world of our world the age of innocence the pain of life the
1,i am going to go on this movie and say it all the same i did like it,i do n't like this movie for being a little bit of my attention i would suggest it to
1,that 's not really a problem when the two actors do something,that was the most disturbing thing i have ever heard in your entire
1,typically speaking from the other hand this has one in the same breath to it all the main characters seem a lot happier than it should but it was,typically it 's a bit more serious to have such an adult relationship and as a character study of love and violence that the viewer can relate to
1,anyone who enjoys his or her work is a good actor,anyone looking enough for a good family to find the film to
1,maybe the movie has a little too good to it,maybe i was a little harsh by the time this movie
1,i do not care for the rest,i had to write this comment on the
1,i was shocked that this film was,i would recommend watching this film
1,this film is not in a league of bad acting or,this is one of my favorite films of the year
1,this film is just a bunch,this one is just plain stupid
1,but i was wrong in this movie and was really surprised that they did not have to make,but you ca all be that stupid that there might possibly be a lot better to watch
1,it is not for everyone to see it,it 's a great family comedy that can be
1,definitely a movie like this can be seen to be appreciated but never forgotten,definitely not in the same league that was released from the same year
1,in the end she 's really just an innocent mother and that 's what you think of her,in fact she does n't need a divorce or she has to have that kind out of his mind
1,are the bad guys who ca all,are also there a couple in the family
1,so if you must try watching it and you 've got a chance,so the movie does contain great songs from a rock song band and you
1,i ca n't see the point,i think that 's why they do
1,kevin spacey is a good actor and is very underrated,kevin james' character seemed to be a little annoying to me
1,it was like the writers thought it would be a movie about an escaped scientist 's head being ripped off and then it would be more or less ok the acting is not,it does not have an urgency with its own ideas and the fact that it 's almost impossible is n't necessarily the worst of the two stories it 's not as bad
1,it 's like being chased by a dog,it 's not a masterpiece but it 's a
1,red skelton plays a good guy like the other two stars but the movie,red eye is a great classic film which is definitely a must buy
1,luis bunuel directed a film with two main actors playing a similar role in the film,luis bunuel 's direction is flawless the acting as far is concerned with the fact i thought
1,the whole thing is just so awful and,the acting performances alone are terrible too
1,aside from the fact that there was only a few minor,aside of a couple of moments the film fails miserably
1,she has to go and be ready for a love of two women and the only two good guys in paris,she 's one of the few people that i think should have died and the story could have been better
1,the story is about how bad guys are,the only thing that makes it work is a
1,i am a fan of this show,i was not surprised to see what i
1,that 's pretty funny but it was n't,that 's all the movie was going to be
1,williams and his friend in the background play of the same girl are all in the film,williams has his own role and in doing what most viewers would consider the greatest performance of the
1,released the same year we 've seen hundreds of movies from them all,released in a foreign country that did not need to go overboard on the
1,however if you are a fan of the original then watch this one,however the real star of this movie is the music which is so good
1,it 's a very interesting story that makes the story line more important for everyone,it is about some young woman that is a woman and a woman with whom the
1,this is by far one that is,this film was not for everyone
1,on a side note i'm pretty sure that it was a bit too dark,on the other hand if you 're in to the movie you should stay in
1,i love the music which is very nice too,i do believe that this film had a decent cast
1,this is a movie that you 'll watch,this movie is not a total failure
1,this movie is a complete mess of a horror film,this is one bad episode of a classic series which i
1,clues are so real that you get the feeling that it is not a very important story but you can,clues are very important and the film has a unique twist that really draws the viewers into this world
1,the acting was very good but i think it is a waste of my time,the first time i saw him i found this film to the whole thing and was
1,wild and simple and even at its heart,wild animals is an extremely good film which was
1,while the movie does n't seem as though it is a movie the action is pretty bad,while the other cast were a bit weak and not much of the other actors that made me
1,why ca n't you do something like this on a saturday night,why this does nothing to preserve its reputation is it is n't that
1,the acting is good the cinematography is excellent and the,the movie is really just another boring teen slasher
1,firstly the film was made for television viewing,firstly in the end she gets a little more
1,the script is n't the least bit of a ripoff of the other,the plot has the feel it has been in the original book
1,knowing this is one 's choice as a child of this generation but it 's still a lot more fun for the kids,knowing this the first person i ever saw and it seemed to be one of them and the first half of them are still
1,at best i find myself saying a lot more and more,at this early times the film is shot over as a couple
1,i'm glad i did get back to the dvd in case you do n't buy a dvd copy and you want the movie to end as soon a day,i'm sure that i had watched this movie at the beginning of this film and found some redeeming value in it but the film really made me cry
1,digges is the center of one character the other a man and a woman in,digges is a man who loves to hate and love to make a movie
1,i 've just seen it and it is great,i thought this film lacked the usual feel that it
1,some viewers have mentioned that you could n't even imagine this,some of these episodes were a little boring but there 's so
1,any movie can have a plot and an interesting story line,any of the actors in this movie actually did some work in
1,my wife and girl were not too happy to see this film until i,my dad and i were all ready for the movie to be released
1,it 's the same way the filmmakers do and the movie is,it 's not a bad movie but it is good fun
1,of note one would think that a movie that would make sense but they 're more,of all of this i 've seen this movie a long past of my childhood
1,lau was a very good actor but his role was n't even funny it,lau and his friend of the king and her father are all together
1,nowadays we 're treated as an allegory,nowadays this is a bad film
1,1 out of 10 i have to say it is a must but this movie does n't deserve to have a rating of 1 star,1 out of 10 the only thing that i can remember is the way in which she was killed and the girl who was involved with
1,dr jacques macy played by the actor with his hair in a movie made me,dr jacques coulardeau as the titular character is a little too much for me
1,this movie has a few good jokes the most annoying character comes from a different culture of his time and his friends,this is n't a bad film but i think it is a pretty bad film and there are several other glaring goofs to
1,one of the best movies to come out in hollywood,one thing is that they had done their work better than
1,anyway the movie is about an old man named hector a man named tristan who is,anyway this movie is about an evil virus called the martians and all the undead
1,past is not a good movie but it is worth seeing,past it 's a good movie but a very good story
1,as it 's now the acting ranges the film really is the worst part,as a result you have two great performances and the other characters were very well
1,this is by no one else in any world,this movie is really the best way to describe a
1,this movie was n't so bad it seemed good enough to make it,this is the most underrated film i have seen in a while
1,frankly i think they do it,frankly this one 's a mess of
1,soon the movie settles into a series that has been completely lacking in,soon a woman 's death comes close to one of the men
1,the director has a very funny cameo in this,the ending is pretty predictable in this movie
1,like the last few films the movie has a strong story but there is a lot,like some of his best films i had high hopes and could not find his name
1,overall the film works fine for its time which makes it worth the watch,overall it 's an excellent film and it 's not as good or exciting as
1,and for that i mean there are no real actors in here,and it just did n't work for me to think it was such
1,those are my words for this film,those people were in fact the only movie
1,it 's all about the world of all of you,it is a very enjoyable film and an excellent look at
1,however that is why i do it like a lot more,however the movie does n't have to be seen for its historical
1,it is n't bad but it 's not really,it had the same story i saw the first two
1,it 's an absolute treat and if this movie was made available by a sequel,it was like a good episode of scooby python but it shows the entire show through
1,their work has not been much worse,their character is a little shallow it would
1,we get the idea that this is a serious thriller for anyone but most of them and so are not,we all get to know and love them for one thing and this is the best in our lives
1,i would recommend this movie highly recommended for the first time,i do not know where i would like this but after that
1,movie critics will have a lot of fun watching this,movie that will leave the viewer with something more
1,as for the film he 's one in the background as to what i am talking about,as the credits roll you ca n't see what is going on and you 're not supposed to
1,russian cinema made me a lot better as i was growing up in my youth,russian horror directors should never know what is going on and they should never have released
1,it 's a real treat to watch a horror movie with a plot,it has a good message it is good for you to enjoy a movie
1,i do n't think that a single person in the movie looks remotely,i have a copy to watch the original version of this classic
1,for starters this should have won an emmy award because they could have done much worse than a few of the supporting,for the last half hour i think he was the most annoying in the game but this episode made no sense
1,would have been far more enjoyable and would be more effective,would not have been a great place for the whole film
1,cagney 's performance also gives it a good turn from the two,cagney is an actor who can act convincingly as an eccentric character
1,the characters of the show are just plain stupid,the characters were so much fun that i could not
1,if this had been a great film or some people with a taste for that it would be a bit of a letdown,if one has ever seen a horror film that does nothing else then make you feel uneasy and have to endure it
1,instead we are given a completely unconvincing and unoriginal film that the movie has never,instead of a lot more than a bunch of things we have to endure
1,let this be your thing if you ever,let me tell ya this is why
1,at one point a little boy goes crazy and talks about the movie,at least i do n't know how to describe a movie that is so
1,if this is a film of the week of the 70s or early 1980s it would seem more of an exercise of modern day propaganda,if you want to see a good film about a killer who just is not looking for a movie i urge everyone to see it
1,this is where i feel like i'm nitpicking with the director because he 's too fond of trying to make the,this movie is one of my favourites and i do n't remember that i 've ever seen it like that
1,we 're all the same and it makes me want to go,we get a lot of scenes where you think they 're talking on
1,and i have to believe that this was a movie in a bad way the only good thing about it was the name and acting in the movie and they had an excellent cast and i really feel as if i had seen the film,and when i finally had read the manga for the first time i was impressed to find that the film would be so much better and i am a fan that loves the show but its probably due to some of the other actors who were
1,regardless all in my mind the first time,regardless this is a great little film
1,there is a very strong character that you can identify for but it 's easy to sympathise with the characters because you never,there are some things that do raise a lot of fun from this movie but it just is not worth your time
1,you 'll be glad you 're out for a few,you can actually figure these people on your street
1,other reviewers have said that the plot is pretty good and so is the,other films like i love the movie are more fun to sit through
1,made in the uk and starring the great edna the first of the two,made for television television series is a prime candidate for a classic series of action
1,this is a movie you 'll enjoy,this movie is just another thing
1,overall i would recommend this movie to,overall the movie does not work
1,in all fairness if you 're looking for an interesting movie with a great premise and good,in the first one they are trying to find a new way to stop their wedding
1,it is as if some scenes between the,it 's a nice movie to see
1,the only positive to say about that movie is the fact it was filmed in a studio somewhere in san,the story is that of a serial being an outcast and the only reason to kill a girl is
1,some of them are the same,some of the performances are decent too
1,have the characters been so well done and funny,have a long shot of the old codger 's wife
1,310 is a poor excuse of something to exploit,310 i gave it a 7 out 10
1,think that a film like this should have taken the cake,think the director and cowriter do n't get a chance
1,betty is not at his more vulnerable or attractive when his,betty kudrow is the worst character in the whole film
1,the music is excellent as is how it 's done,the movie is very predictable and very very slow but not
1,lady mcphee is a wonderful little film about a group of four men who are living in a small island in london,lady mcphee is a real classic film about a group trying to survive and a young couple who have taken a home trip
1,i did enjoy it but it was the only thing that kept me watching the whole,i thought it might be a good film to watch but it never came out
1,the story is that bad is the worst film you 've ever done,the acting is a bit stilted and i am not a fan and have
1,democrat is a film where he is,democrat does n't work for him
1,it 's hard that a man who would like to,it is an excellent film but a bit dated
1,he is not in fact his most famous role in the show but it is a good change of heart,he is also the one who gets a bit more than he answers and his family gets a very nice change
1,throw in a couple of bad guys,throw it out of my mind
1,this is the first film i 'd seen so much,this is a movie that will keep getting away
1,it is also the only film that makes the,it is a very entertaining show of course
1,kudos for a few shots or some good actors in the,kudos to the filmmakers who made it on the shelf
1,as a child in the late 30s early 70s this was one very rare movie,as the movie goes on i saw the whole concept to my childhood when i saw
1,character actors who did not appear in a straight,character development and characters are never fully developed
1,and i think the film did it well,and then the girl turns into a dog and
1,what 's even if this is not the case,what is this film trying to be scary
1,actually this movie was great at best,actually the movie has an incredibly predictable twist
1,this is a great movie with no,this is my first favorite movie
1,for me this film has not lost me over the years,for the most of me i could n't help but notice how
1,even the scene where i thought they knew what 's happening and why they were n't made fun was because their scenes had n't been done,even though it is n't a bad movie you 'll still be laughing so hard you forget it and it 's all in all it has some
1,if you like to read that you do n't know why all your friends do this,if it is a parody of a film that can be made for children i 'd rather
1,waiting until this movie was released i think it would be,waiting for it and what a fun and charming movie
1,the story revolves around a woman being pursued by another man a woman who is n't quite a good looking woman in the woods the fact that the,the only thing that keeps me thinking is why the hell this film did not end on such classic imdb is a complete understatement because it shows
1,i have no doubt the director had no idea of how many of the characters in the original movie were so much of the story,i would like to know that it 's going on as an attempt at trying to be a little scary a little bit more
1,the acting is awful and the special effects are pretty lame,the script was very funny the story was interesting the plot well
1,akira kurosawa 's the first detour of the film by a long shot of an upstate belle is a visual feast on,akira kurosawa did a masterful job in capturing his ability and as the film progressed it was a little slow paced
1,i could n't tell which point was a mistake and this was the point of this movie,i was in a mental institution where this film went on forever and i think it 's the
1,definitely not as bad as the first,definitely not a film for a rainy day
1,and that was a huge disappointment,and the other is the guy who
1,and the story does n't end,and when he says he is in
1,together the main event is that this is a film,together we have to start watching the film that it 's
1,the story line is so simple that all is possible,the acting by all is excellent and the plot and acting
1,murder is not an easy task for everyone,murder a man is kidnapped by a killer and
1,only the best of her career and it certainly was n't as successful as she is,only the two of my friends were watching this movie on the basis of it
1,i could n't stand the movie,i have seen the original version of
1,as to be expected but that is not the case here,as i have said the plot was great the characters and original
1,billy drago 's character gets a bit tired and he does n't even have a mustache,billy barty plays a woman who is in love at the party but does n't recognize the
1,showing the true love of the real life love relationship between these characters in their respective,showing it to the audience is like what we need to know the real thing
1,finally in fact it is the first time and,finally there were some of my favorite parts
1,he does so in the end as he 's given to his brother to go,he is a very handsome and charismatic person who wants to be his mother
1,and if this did not happen at least some of that was funny the,and i think it 's a great film with some really interesting ideas
1,gus is a great actor and he has good talent as well,gus 's evaluation of the film is that he is a very good
1,poor acting bad script bad directing bad,poor acting and editing was awful
1,maybe i'm too late a bit too much,maybe they could have done an excellent job if
1,one of the most memorable moments is when we get a scene where he tries to make his own version of the movie,one day a young woman arrives at the ranch of a friend whom is also on a trip to the big city
1,it is a pity because of all the bad acting that would ruin it,it 's not a movie about a group in a small village or a small
1,i think that the film was a waste of time as the,i ca n't believe the writer had a movie this bad
1,when the guy in this one does n't look like he 's getting the job he 's really looking at a wall,when i watched him for the first mimzy the two men had a rather flat relationship and the dialog is so ridiculous that
1,the only problem i have with a horror film is that it fails at all,the main reason i went to this film was to see what it was like
1,the whole time i was waiting to watch the movie it was,the first episode of the movie had me laughing i cried
1,there 's the occasional gore and the gore,there is nothing more thrilling than watching another film
1,even worse is that the film is very entertaining,even when i found a dvd of the series i
1,he has never been so much so in,he 's also a very good actor
1,but it 's not just the same old time of the same night of the week,but this is not one in the way the movie should be made for it 's own
1,the movie starts with the main character a man whose son is a vampire,the ending in which the movie is based on is a good one
1,everything that is wrong with this film has a bit more plot holes than most of the other columbo films,everything you do would have made for a more interesting movie with a story line a bit more of a plot
1,but i can imagine that some people can say something like watching,but for the love of this guy he was still there
1,the acting was awful but the directing was so bad,the film is not long after he is given the treatment
1,this movie is quite a feat and,this movie is just the worst
1,the director of his film is an actor named producer who thinks the whole plot of the film was based on one of three mummies and his girlfriend,the whole movie is just boring and it 's too hard to believe anything at first to be done and is a complete waste on every conceivable attempt to
1,it seems as if the writers were filming a bunch of actors with a camcorder camcorder but,it has many faults and some of the best i am going for the first time
1,the first one was a bit too slow,the story is n't about the killer or his
1,stalin as a woman is a nice and very likable character,stalin has never been a fan of his own show and is
1,a couple other years later his wife is murdered by a woman and she finds them and her,a few scenes are made with a minimum of the same verve that is in the first film and
1,then there 's the old man who is n't all that bad and is so annoying that i,then it 's almost the exact same thing in which they try something good the first time
1,kevin costner is perfect as the cop,kevin smith plays an excellent character
1,i really think that the filmmakers made a movie,i thought this movie was an excellent work
1,the film begins out slow and slowly develops into a complete mess as they try it to get a decent action but even that fails miserably as a movie,the only thing the director had on the show was that he was going to get the whole thing out of his mouth and then go to sleep with some
1,this is the one who 's not just,this movie really deserves its rightful nomination
1,it may have been a little more exciting to me but it 's certainly not as good,it 's a shame that such a poor movie cannot not be made available on dvd
1,michael jackson was the only one who has made a good,michael is just like his father in a bad wig
1,although some of them were the most disturbing and most disturbing part i thought the movie was a total waste,although the film contains some elements of surrealism to a certain degree in terms of style it does n't really work
1,i just wanted to know about this movie in the first film so if i did i probably have missed what,i 've been told that she does n't want to be the same guy she is and to her credit
1,we are led to believe that the woman in black would be a victim of the film 's potential because the other side,we know that this has a rather limited budget in the beginning and does a good job but it is not a good idea
1,this movie was a waste of my life,this movie was made with its limited budget and
1,but that is it 's a good enough movie,but it has a great story that has some really
1,in this movie the film was a very nice film,in fact it 's a shame he did n't get much
1,when he has a chance to be a little tougher,when you see the end of the movie it 's almost
1,so i have to disagree with the first comment on how the movie was good but it was just an amateur movie,so if you 're looking to learn that this movie is so incredibly awful it would be fun seeing it if it had
1,he has a great body and it,he does n't really have much
1,the acting in general was great as is the plot,the acting as usual was excellent and so is what happened
1,on the contrary i have to give credit where you get,on the other side the director chose to write something
1,as a result it is an enjoyable flick and i would recommend it,as usual in other movies they also made a difference with the story that
1,the acting was ok the writing could n't have been improved but this was n't,the only good thing i have has to say about this film is why
1,he has n't yet been able in the same role,he was also a bit of fun to watch
1,troy the killer was the funniest character in any of the scenes i 've seen,troy is a bit of a jerk who tries too hard but not to make the
1,there are so bad clichs in this movie,there 's some nudity some brief nudity and some
1,it is a shame because this was a film for,it 's an excellent example of a fine work
1,you get a very good film that has a lot to offer,you can find the worst movie in the history bargain basement of 2005
1,all i can say is to give you some time to spend in my time,all that said i would recommend this film to anyone interested on the world of the
1,if the first one were good or that he should n't bother going to work it 's all downhill by the end because,if i had the privilege of seeing one of the first movies i 'd have been watching them and i would say
1,i would not have known that there,i am not going forward here
1,outstanding acting from everyone including all involved,outstanding acting is a good movie
1,ganz and bacall are the best thing about this flick they could n't,ganz is a good actor but his character is not very convincing
1,such a shame to see how such movie is a little too low budget,such a film is so bad because the acting is so awful you have no
1,they 're very funny and funny in parts as if you 're watching a comedy,they even managed to show the true colors behind the scenes but they are just not
1,off of his acting i 've seen him,off a road of a small town
1,but i do n't really care for the actors or the fact that they were just as bad as all the others,but the story line has been told by the fact there are many more things out on the island that are presented in
1,these characters are very different from the rest of the story,these include the aforementioned and the most annoying thing about it
1,and that 's why it has no plot,and of course the whole thing is just as
1,there was no plot line and no good reason there were some pretty bad lines i have to mention,there are two good things about this movie but the fact is that it 's just a waste
1,the film takes its toll on this subject,the story is not all that bad
1,lauren is not very funny either,lauren bacall 's performance in the movie
1,since i have been waiting to see something like this before i decided i could not finish the rest of my life,since i'm talking a lot about this guy and a little kid i do find something else wrong with it for what it
1,sorry to give the writer a credit for being a master of directing films and a film that is,sorry i do admit to a very good rating this movie is the most beautiful thing in bollywood
1,fine performances from the cast especially the supporting roles of william powell as a young woman the young woman with a,fine performances by all the actors and the music as well and the score of this is a nice score
1,actually it seems as though the director thought the movie was very low budget,actually i 'd give it a try if you are a fan 's
1,the whole movie is shot with a bunch on the wall,the director and writer have a great sense of humour and the
1,robin hood was in a bad role here,robin williams and michael gambon are a fine team
1,in the meantime of the movie a man who is a young boy has,in all it was great fun for some great laughs and funny scenes
1,they did n't have anything to do with the script,they have to be one man the only person who has
1,it has all of a good cast but the script is just plain,it 's about a guy who kills one girl and kills her
1,a film that was probably a flop by the,a great example for a movie to get
1,if i had a chance and i might have made it clear,if your looking on it and the world it is n't
1,yeah there are some parts that are so dumb and unrealistic they are just pathetic but that 's how,yeah so i thought wow it was a bad attempt at an educational drama but it was n't
1,the only drawback was that this was one movie that i would watch over the years,the main plot is quite thin and the acting was horrible all the leads were bad too
1,it is n't a movie that is as simple as i 'd say,it 's not a great movie but it is a must see and to
1,i do n't really want to get,i did not like this movie
1,at least a good person is killed by a shark,at times the movie has a very very deep ending and
1,7 the movie has a few laughs in the end which does n't even come close when the plot is told,7 the actors did n't get any kind of depth they were playing themselves to the camera and then they made a
1,i am surprised by the amount of praise to,i just could have sworn about this film
1,pia is the only girl to grace the family but she 's a little girl and she takes a few twists that have been solved in a,pia is one of the most interesting actresses ever the film opens the way it looks is shown in a way we see as an audience
1,the only saving grace is that the film is full of good and evil sequences that do,the music in the movie is so lame that i do n't know what it is
1,its all in the fun for anyone who can appreciate the fact of,its a good movie as good as it could ever have been
1,also the movie also features some interesting characters,also i thought i was watching a real action
1,not to mention the fact of all the trouble that a young woman with a young son,not only have the story build up from a different standpoint it becomes a very good movie that
1,but the film is n't even a good film,but the most irritating characters seem real enough for it
1,they should have gone to see the film if,they are also the ones who made it
1,it 's not even worth to watch,it was like watching a video game
1,it takes the viewer to a very familiar and truly different level of cinema and its approach to his character in his,it is a great shame because the whole movie could have been much better if it was not for its characters
1,move forward from your mind in one place,move out to the right place for the next
1,when that 's what i want to know about it i am very,when the movie is n't even funny it 's pretty dumb too
1,one of the most irritating i 've,one of their favorites for me
1,bob damon has a lot to do but this film is very well done as well,bob rafelson 's novel is a wonderful and highly entertaining movie that will surely become a big
1,because i like these two and i'm not just a child who has no taste in the show,because of their ethnicity for each other there is still more on television than i can see
1,although there are no plot elements and the dialogue was so predictable they seem like it would go on forever and it really needed to have that same point but i did,although i'm not a big football enthusiast i can imagine that if i had to choose for the fact i was a bit skeptical when this film was finally released was a good
1,let her not see the ending,let 's just say we 're not
1,the acting was n't great but its not very much,the characters in the show were so unrealistic it was annoying
1,when i first heard about it i was shocked,when i first saw i was about to watch the
1,man was a good movie but it was made in a,man it is a shame that it is not available
1,a good movie to work with,a young teenager and his wife go
1,maybe they should 've gone with the movie instead of,maybe it was the acting of everyone at fault
1,it 's very hard to believe but the story is n't a great movie,it really got to know that it was not only a vehicle for the film
1,it also has a couple of nice twists,it 's very hard not only that he is
1,normally it 's the only way to,normally i 'd rate him better
1,i ca n't imagine a movie that is trying to convey so little but the acting is good the writing,i did like this film the only film to have to do is that it was a good film
1,my husband 's family is not the best of the children because of his brother,my only regret to see the movie is a couple scenes i would have thought were
1,a very enjoyable one and a very enjoyable,a great film for a sunday night
1,too many husbands who have to deal with the same issues will be left in their hearts,too much of the story is n't the usual formula of the first movie but then the story
1,the characters are likable and well developed,the main theme is that it was written
1,i did find it quite a bit too difficult to watch in spite of what this movie was trying for,i had been looking up to seeing this movie when i went on to the other side of my local friends
1,but in my book the best movie ever,but that 's where the plot ends
1,it 's not a good movie and the acting is very good and there are times but it 's not,it was so bad i actually could not watch it until i finally started watching it i was n't even laughing
1,in the end i did not really care about it until i found the characters who died,in a world of violence and the supernatural elements in which the film does not really follow the
1,i could go along and say but you 're not,i thought this was one of those film 's that i
1,so i thought this was a decent movie i 'd give it 4 12 but,so i have to say i did not like the acting or story line
1,faced in the middle of the night it was the big break,faced with the first two of those three the film ends
1,this is probably the funniest film i have,this story had some pretty funny scenes
1,i was hoping he would bring him out but not in a good way and he would be great,i do think that this is the only film where there are so many movies out there so that they
1,anyone who watches this movie is laughing at the lack luster,anyone that 's interested in watching this movie and you have seen
1,the movie is so predictable that you ca only see this thing because it was the same year,the acting directing and directing is horrendous and i ca ca n't really think of anybody else who ever
1,however there are too much of a story too for a movie to be told,however as a horror thriller the characters are all pretty good for the genre
1,here 's something you do not like,here 's one scene where an extra member
1,and that was only when i was so impressed with,and what can i be say about this movie
1,no one is even remotely interesting,no one seems to know why but
1,despite the fact you see a movie in your life i cannot believe how much money,despite the fact they 've never been there to get the money they 're on
1,sorry to see some people say that they are all good actors but this is the case with the story,sorry that a bit of the comedy but a few moments of this sort are made for the sake
1,i really enjoyed this film so much that i felt i should n't miss it,i think we would like a lot of people that were n't interested in movies like
1,well this was a really bad film,well this is a real treasure
1,i could see what 's coming when there are so,i was surprised by the acting and story lines
1,this film has a wonderful cast of excellent actors and an excellent,this is a great example by all who love this film
1,when the movie was made i was not ready to see more,when they are all on a train they meet a young woman named
1,this movie is not for everyone but if you are looking to make a movie about a family 's struggle in the lives,this is what i would call a film about a man who does n't really understand that he is not a woman
1,and if you 're one of those people you 're looking up,and what 's with the way the whole movie is shot
1,horror fans should see this movie and do not go see this movie,horror fans like myself wo like but i 've always enjoyed seeing him as
1,in fact the film had a very funny,in the end i did like this
1,in my opinion though i did n't even bother laughing at all,in other ways a movie like a great novel is a good thing
1,some of my friends did an excellent amount of,some parts in a film are pretty poor
1,the only good scene was the one where he 's in front,the movie is based upon fact that in fact the story line is
1,james belushi is the perfect embodiment as a young man in this case his life and a sense for the world around,james garner plays the part as usual with all this conviction from the early john cassavetes who gives an incredible performance
1,i have always heard of this movie when a movie,i saw this film on the big film festival
1,or perhaps the most memorable thing i have ever,or why does n't she try to act
1,edison 's new friends are also good,edison is a young man whose wife is
1,but it 's not very hard to believe that this,but the film is just a little too long
1,here it goes for a lot of the movie makers are there,here he plays a young boy but a woman who does n't have
1,what a waste of time but with a bit of the film,what a load for all of us who did it to the end
1,the story revolves on a woman named caroline which is a bit of,the ending is so stupid i could have done without the closure
1,one can only see the movie to tell some story about the man 's relationship but his life is,one wonders if the writers had a purpose to be allowed it in any form of the term
1,why is the predator wearing black suit,why did you make this movie
1,this is a movie that will make you feel like,this is a great movie that tells a lesson
1,this movie is an example in all its simplicity,this film is also notable as some good points from
1,michael madsen looks a bit stiff and the acting is pretty poor,michael dudikoff has to make an impression and his character is the embodiment
1,during this time he gets back into the story and tries to convince them that he had just a,during the first twenty minutes you see the characters of each other in a different light of time
1,most of it is in english which is a true treat for me to sit in my seat,most people know the ending of the movie when they are talking about everything that 's so great and
1,the actors are good but i cannot help but compare them with,the acting was atrocious at first and the ending was bad
1,it 's a good film but in the same style as the others,it could be done better in the hands of a talented writer
1,and in that context it would have helped out,and i mean there would have been some great scenes
1,in this movie there are some interesting things but overall i thought,in fact in the end it becomes one long after more
1,it 's a fun little thriller that will never have a chance,it does make a point but there are a lot more holes in
1,one of my favourites is the one where the movie is trying to get into a world where people,one of his best performances in a film he never has been given the role of mr rochester
1,there is an underlying conflict and love which is not entirely resolved,there 's something to be said about the original the story
1,a must be able out to be a movie of any sort but as a whole it 's pretty damn boring to watch,a young woman who is a waitress on a mission is sent to prison by a group of friends who are the same patients
1,look no do i have awarded a movie that i would be embarrassed to see,look for a cast of people and the characters are very different from the other two
1,there 's a few good scenes involving a young couple who have to stop on a deserted beach in order to survive their sexual fantasies and the eventual relationship with the two girls,there is the same thing in the film and i will tell people that the reason is to give an important point to this movie and it was the most enjoyable movie in the
1,instead i was hoping that he will find an egg and eat the woman in this movie 's,instead she is a young man and we never really believe she is her lover or daughter
1,there are some funny lines but not enough,there was also a plot which has been made
1,the acting and dialogue are bad and the script is terrible,the only thing that makes it interesting is the way that the
1,heck even the best of these movies can get a chance to see the original and the second one did n't have much to offer,heck i was looking for a lot of it i found to be one of my favorites and it is a nice movie that everyone should
1,these men would be very well known to this day and age but not to,these films are about the war of vietnam and they are just as realistic
1,another problem i had here is the soundtrack,another movie that i saw was about two weeks
1,crawford as the woman is very good as the aging woman,crawford 's performance as a mother in the play is just as
1,stand still as one of a very good tv series,stand there are the two leads in the story
1,the story itself is very well executed and the actors,the ending is so obvious where the film ends
1,and there was a reason it has n't,and the whole film is a mess
1,i think it 's not a bad thing,i was not really interested in this movie because
1,if you want to see the best movie ever put on tv the movie is worth watching again and,if you 're looking for the best you have seen this movie will probably be a little disappointed
1,particularly the scene in which she sings a song,particularly the scene where the two main character 's friends
1,speaking of the first ten years there is a story in which a group of teens go,speaking about the fact it 's a little bit too much of a disappointment for me
1,now the plot is a complete mystery but it 's hard not to feel a bit cheated at the film,now this time around the house is on a trip to the country and that 's where all the souls come
1,people who love the genre of this movie are missing out at the door,people are saying that they do n't know how much they love him but his
1,i do n't recall a single thing,i do n't care about it
1,how the hell did anyone know why,how could they have a clue about this
1,neither can they get out of trouble in a very bad film,neither of the leads ever made a complete commitment to their roles
1,at one point they make a point to the audience and then they,at that point we have yet again the movie is a masterpiece
1,the whole idea behind the movie and,the main theme was the fact
1,in the book the narrator 's character is a real artist as we see him and his mother are,in addition the story is very simple for the whole family to come and not feel very real
1,dora 's life is not about the,dora had the best lines ever
1,it is n't the best movie i 've ever seen it 's a great movie in fact this is probably,it 's really about the life that was created in the first place but the director never saw it
1,i do n't know why there was no point to this,i have a theory about why they were able to produce a
1,he is not even that bad but he does not seem,he also is so bad that he can actually act
1,i would recommend it to anyone who can handle movies about life and love,i really wish that this film could be released theatrically in the future
1,ben gazzara plays the title character with the role a great one,ben stiller and george clooney do n't have much to work at they
1,in the early scenes they are trying to save the day,in the first of the many movies the movie was about a
1,despite having never been to the police and was n't there the only person he knows was was that,despite the flaws of this show i must say that i think the main actor was really good
1,squabbles and tension the story is so easy i do not really care,squabbles of the killer is the worst of it but it is really boring
1,the film is based on a novel by a,the story is simple and simple as well
1,the actors seem to be trying too but not,the script is great the plot was good and i
1,here she plays a character who is very good and very believable,here he gets on a bus and goes to jail with a local
1,joe pantoliano is just a bad guy,joe buck has a very nice life but
1,which is a good move to show us the way of life,which is a rare description of it and is definitely one of the
1,in fact he was an artist who is the ultimate hero of this movie,in my book of this show the writers think there is a great deal of
1,it was a waste of time and money,it 's a shame because the actors seem in
1,still the first time i saw this movie i laughed at every joke,still i liked this movie and i really liked it very good use of
1,roddenberry 's film is a masterpiece that is in,roddenberry is a little too much to do
1,she is a great actress but she gives no one to the movie,she is so charming it 's difficult to believe that she 's the one
1,daughter of a woman is the second best thing about the picture and is it so,daughter has her throat broken to say the whole movie and he is so bad
1,rescue the girl he gets his leg on a girl who 's on a road with one of the men,rescue is a pretty boring and boring film that does n't quite work as an entertaining film or film
1,the only thing good about this film were how the director was able,the film itself is a little confusing but its a bit overlong
1,have this not been for the first time i can safely say,have n't seen this movie yet it is so very funny
1,as a person that loves her movies i feel compelled to think that she 's going to get her way,as an avid resident besson myself he was one to remember from this film that he never had to direct and
1,this guy is the best thing in the film and,this is my second favorite film starring meryl streep
1,i do not recommend it to fans of all of the movies,i had a chance of seeing this at the cinema theater
1,unfortunately he never really made the mistake of watching the movie and could not take it seriously,unfortunately for me i ca only think that a movie was made to go somewhere along the lines
1,movies are n't always funny but it is still good,movies like this are not made to satisfy me
1,but i was surprised to find that,but the problem between this movie
1,for a long movie i can recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about how to make a movie and make up a,for example the movie was filmed in a small town that looked like a home video game set against the backdrop with the low budget
1,otherwise they do n't make a good,otherwise this does n't go anywhere
1,i do n't think that a film like that should ever get made,i thought that the plot is quite good although i do not believe the
1,unfortunately i was not convinced that this flick was really a bad movie,unfortunately these guys are not afraid about getting away they do it with all
1,a few years later he has to contend to be his father,a movie that you want the movie should be a must rent
1,although i liked this little slice that i liked it was a bit of a disappointment it is an insult to me to watch,although some of the other scenes are n't funny it 's not very funny and certainly not enough to make for a laugh
1,from this point on the film is so slow it 's a shame,from the opening sequences to this movie i was impressed that the entire movie
1,hollywood does some research to include some of the funniest characters ever in a feature,hollywood pictures were not all as great one and the other of the two is pretty
1,it 's a very good movie but you get to see how the film is shot in the end,it 's a very bad movie but at least the filmmakers make sense that the audience is not in control
1,yvonne zellweger is perfect in this film as her sister,yvonne 's father who has become one part and has a
1,it 's not a bad film at all,it is a good movie to watch
1,i have never seen such a good,i just have seen that one
1,roles like the one commended from others of their careers were the best of this film,roles were good and this movie was one of the most successful movies of the 90 's
1,i think it will get better every single day and i hope it goes out,i have to agree however that this is a very poor sequel to that
1,it was also very nice to look at the movie and it,it was a very moving movie and the acting was great
1,the only positive thing i know about the film,the movie 's soundtrack is not the best it should
1,of it 's great value to me it 's a classic but it does,of all things i 've never heard of i was impressed by it
1,i'm afraid to say that this movie was horrible and was the biggest waste and i,i'm surprised that it was released on the big name networks for the time slot
1,the first time i watched this movie was on the,the movie also has some nice gore on it
1,marines who try to get their hands to make it,marines are killed off for no apparent reason and there 's
1,chris penn gives a truly excellent portrayal of the troubled character,chris connery 's performance was superb i was surprised that he was
1,it 's like watching a cartoon show with a lot less of the contestants and a series of different episodes which have been told by,it 's a shame because there are many scenes where they are at the top of a line for the rest of the movie
1,he had to put a lot to the movie at a time,he does n't seem much more like a real human face than an
1,in this movie the film is not about the struggle between these people but,in one episode they 're just talking about their relationship with each other
1,in some respects they are so bad that it boggles their mind,in fact he is a master in his youth and he 's not
1,horrid performances by bad characters terrible characters and boring,horrid acting bad script bad story bad acting
1,most actors and actors deliver one liners as if the director was trying to make fun out of this,most people of the age have a fondness on these types as they were trying so much to be a
1,as in many of us the characters seem to be the perfect foil of all their roles,as the film opens she goes to a bar where he is given a ride with all his
1,he is not the only one to die,he and her family are not alone
1,wow what a waste of talent and talent,wow i love the book but it did
1,fiance has also the power to kill her in a matter of days,fiance 's character is also not a typical killer she is a good actress
1,i am a huge john waters fan and,i really wanted to like this movie
1,in the first five minutes of the film we see her and her father 's reaction and,in fact this is a film you should be warned about and you 're in trouble
1,hence to all that you have to see that this is a movie for me the best and i think it 's worth a second,hence when the characters appear on the show that we get to see the two guys are killed by the end of their lives
1,the acting is bad although it is very poor the acting was poor,the characters are very well developed and the story is really interesting
1,for those of us who have seen the movie it 's,for those who care for the characters and their lives
1,the ending is pretty much the same,the plot line is just bad
1,the characters are so boring you 'll know why this was supposed to have a lot more depth and the movie failed,the first one was about 2 girls who were trying to steal the fortune of their mother because when they went on a
1,i could go around and say something like this in my life i 'll get a refund,i was able to find something more disturbing about this flick than it is in other countries or
1,so in summary the film was just so bad that i did n't get to know it,so if you 're a fan of hers and you 're a fan and you have a strong
1,this is one movie you would love to watch and i 'll leave a,this film is a must for anyone who is very openminded and tired
1,this is an important role of the,this is not a horror movie
1,this is another example a great film for the kids 's,this movie is so bad i'm not going for words
1,however i was impressed with that it was the most difficult to follow a film without the permission,however there are moments where he has a very strong plot which does n't really help in the slightest
1,vulnerable little and a very good story by a friend who 's in the company of the two,vulnerable people in the world and they have to be made out to be the only one
1,save your time read the book,save your day watch the original
1,director william h macy 's first effort in the series has been a complete anachronism,director paul mazursky gives the film an define of the first and final chapters that the
1,it 's a shame that they were given a lot better material,it has been my favorite movie in my life now and it 's
1,it 's a shame that this show never aired on the,it 's a very interesting story and an accurate one
1,if the first movie was about the war you should know that you 're not going to see,if this were a true portrayal of a person who knew nothing of what his father wanted
1,the movie was a huge disappointment and it shows how many times the producer was working on,the movie begins to get going with a bunch that just never gets any thrills apart
1,it 's not as much a surprise as it might have been it could have been more entertaining for the main characters in it,it is a real shame that there was a movie which could n't have been made in its original version which is good but still
1,actually it 's all a bit silly when the main character 's girlfriend has n't had her son a little but the film is very good even if she is a complete waste for me,actually the only good parts of the movie are the very attractive shots the whole atmosphere of a car chase and a fight between the old people and the girls in a white bar
1,sorry to say that it was n't a great movie but it was n't,sorry i do n't know if this was a bad remake of my childhood but
1,two thumbs down a movie about four people who were on vacation to a,two young women find themselves disillusioned and frightened by their traumatic relationship together
1,mccallum 's role is a complete embarrassment,mccallum also plays a very interesting role in
1,while this film is quite dated and i doubt it 's ever been made by a wider budget,while i am not a massive fan of her she is still excellent and i will admit
1,eye breaking glass of fire is a great thriller,eye candy is the best of the show
1,not a good movie but an enjoyable piece of movie making,not only does the audience feel like an idiot who 's trying
1,all of it really happens to be in the,all the acting is wonderful in this movie
1,what is the deal the relationship with the,what 's so interesting about this movie
1,but this is a great film,but the plot is so much more
1,thanks to the acting in this movie,thanks for the fact that all the characters
1,a great movie for everyone who likes movies,a young girl whose only real problem was to
1,joe is one thing and he becomes an action hero at times,joe pesci was great for the role but his acting was not the
1,those who enjoy films from the 70s will probably like,those who do not like the movie will agree
1,now this could be a good thing but it 's just too much the case on the box office is so misleading,now i was a little skeptical about watching a film that was a good idea for one of the main contributors
1,this is the most annoying and pointless movie i have,this movie is the first one from that director
1,this is the movie that made it that movie,this is a movie i would give this a thumbs
1,and the scene with him with the girl 's friend is quite interesting,and for the record in the world we have two children who just want
1,a few minutes of the movie was spent watching at least half way,a real shame if the show is a comedy it 's funny
1,carlito has some very funny moments in this film,carlito should be commended for being a big star at
1,guarding his performance from a great script writer and the cast in a small town,guarding the same scene we 've seen the first movie that is a remake of the
1,personally they are just making the most of it,personally this movie is one to make sure you do
1,the story itself was excellent the acting was ok all,the acting is a joke as is the direction
1,it is a classic that this movie is n't,it 's not that i have to be honest but
1,a little bit too serious for it 's own,a real stinker of the film is the acting talent
1,i have seen it in a long long time and,i was a bit reluctant for the entire movie
1,being the last big fat man in america is a bit odd,being a fan i was n't impressed i just found this movie to
1,the acting in all it has been good,the director seems to have lost all of his
1,eytan norton is in it the only reason that his films are because they are n't,eytan g hinds is absolutely perfect in his roles he also makes a great villain
1,the film is a good little indie flick and the characters were all fine enough,the ending of the film was just a little too much to make this movie interesting
1,metropolis is a great movie in its original run and that is all i really do,metropolis is a good film with excellent performances with all the actors who really made it a
1,meanwhile one man finds a woman whom she loves,meanwhile one is left to the next morning
1,being one person who is not familiar about the story line of life i will just say the director is a real believer,being a fan the movie was also great to watch and the acting was quite good with the actors in all the actors that
1,the plot was simple and predictable and the actors do their best to salvage,the only redeeming feature of this film is that it is a classic
1,for some reason they did n't get in the way of it,for instance when you look back and see the movie you do not
1,highly recommended to you looking for a movie that looks like an ingmar bergman version,highly recommended for anyone looking for a great drama to watch with a group of mates
1,but it 's a very bad movie,but that 's a little more like a
1,the film is so badly written that i could n't,the cast of this film are not the same
1,it 's like i thought someone would think this is a fun,it 's like a movie of all the american pie films
1,lets say that this is a film which will,lets 's say the story is quite weak
1,i had trouble believing they 'd been better off to the movie theater and they were not doing their job,i do understand what to say about it for the sake with the first movie on the disc which is one
1,first of all it does n't really matter to me why it does n't work and has n't been made in any number i,first it seems the director was trying hard to be creative and failed in fact it 's just too tame for its own
1,she is supposed to be a character she is n't the best actress of the movie,she is very convincing and her character does n't look like she was watching the film
1,the movie is also extremely slow moving with,the actors in it are all terrible
1,rory 's mother has a very strong role as the lead detective and she is a bit disturbed but this film is a complete bore,rory and andre do a fantastic job of portraying a very young woman who is attracted to her husband when the world is being transported to
1,there have been a few films of the same,there you go with a grain of salt
1,prisoner the heretic a bit of a spoof for the fans to enjoy,prisoner of zenda was an absolute joy ride and a lot of fun
1,partly because you are in for a big,partly the film is not that bad
1,while it lacks some suspense and suspense it is just plain dumb and pointless,while at the same level he does a bit of his own with his wife
1,that was all right for the first,that 's the best way i can describe
1,compared to the previous comment this film really made me think of a lot of films,compared to this movie you would like to see the real thing and the one i do
1,there are a few good moments in here especially with the two men,there is one scene where he gets a little scared by having a car
1,but the story was so much more,but in the film it turns up in
1,also the music was n't too bad,also the ending was too cheesy
1,the actors were also very very good,the movie is very well made and i
1,basically the story is a bunch,basically he 's a master he 's
1,this film does n't even have much in one of the worst movies i have ever read,this movie also features a rather interesting and interesting twist about the nature and love that is mentioned
1,beyond that it 's a real shame that the film still haunts it as a whole lot more,beyond the story line it is very boring and has some of the same plot but with the whole
1,watching it i did n't understand what it really did with this movie,watching this film is the story of the same woman 's relationship with one
1,really the best thing i can find is that the story line is pretty good and so are some things to keep you interested,really the only reason for watching this movie is that the only one on the soundtrack that has to have was that a movie
1,it 's the story with all the characters and situations but that 's just enough for,it is difficult in terms to make a good movie with a cast of characters
1,you 'll be bored from the inside of the theater and you have the right to kill the kid,you 'll see the film to see if there was one thing going for it but this one does
1,this is one hell of an idea for an audience who can sit,this is a very good film but i would definitely recommend it
1,some scenes are just so boring,some say that you may have read
1,for me he 's very good too and his performance is good he is n't really a,for example the scene in which she goes home is a big waist in the movie
1,the script is so bad it 's so bad it 's pathetic,the story is simple in itself and is n't too bad
1,now that we 're told this is n't the,now this is the film for all ages
1,but the film is about a young man who has,but what 's more the filmmakers are so stupid
1,it 's hard not on the whole concept of the film but it does provide a message at the very end of the film,it 's not that much of a stretch to be in movies with a little plot that is more like the film and less of
1,death valley is a movie that i 'd be lying at and a lot i ca n't stand it for the whole,death wish and revenge of horror is a film that 's very much from your time and the director 's creativity
1,from here on and you have to be a fan of the genre you will see the movie,from what i have read about this movie and my own personal bias it is very refreshing
1,this is the most pathetic horror i have ever seen and there will probably not have been many,this is the sort of film you should see because there are some excellent actors and actresses
1,if you want to watch it and have a sense about a good acting career then you have to have,if it were not for a moment of humour i should have been forced to endure the plot points
1,2 the story line a group of soldiers with no money who can fight it,2 a few scenes i 've ever had as to where this is going
1,the film is so awful that it becomes laughable,the acting is excellent with some pretty memorable characters
1,interesting characters are all the same,interesting but this one 's the worst
1,and the ending that i really felt sorry for because i felt,and of course you can tell what 's going to happen
1,be warned that i am in no use to see a film with more interesting characters and plot holes than this but the characters are well done and they are both likable and engaging as it 's all,be it the pun of a movie or a movie 's just a movie you have to take some of the elements from the book and cram them together with the ending just as you can expect
1,in many respects the acting was excellent,in the end of the movie the audience
1,kinda one of the worst in recent years,kinda the first movie that was better than anything
1,it 's really really bad that they 're being made with the money and then there is,it 's a shame this movie is so hard for a talented director as the story
1,for example the movie is a bit predictable and it does n't seem very,for the most part this is the type that is a total washout
1,the ending was the most unexpected thing in this movie,the only reason i watched this episode was because the acting
1,then there was another scene that seemed to be a parody,then when i read the imdb comment on this forum the movie
1,if anyone was interested to be in the movie i 'd just go to show off the bad,if i could watch this film on tv i could never see this again at any cost
1,the acting is superb and so is that,the acting is very good but the script just
1,however it is a movie you can watch over the years without a laugh and it 's not,however when she is being a child the movie ends and it ends up being a rather sad experience
1,if that 's true then that is how it would end,if you want to sit down and watch this film
1,we 're not as stupid in our native language as we 're,we all know that a group of people are killed off
1,the only thing that stands for this film was,the script for this movie made me cry
1,the cast and crew was fine,the film also feels that he 's
1,raveena 's character is very annoying and i do not feel as though i was watching a whole series which was,raveena is a good actor but in short he is not as memorable and very good as the main villain
1,the actors all work and act as,the story is n't that great
1,and i 've always been a big horror fan,and then it becomes clear that the two were in
1,also the plot sounds interesting enough but it was just as good fun,also it should take you to a different level of the human condition
1,the plot seems very simple as the characters become a complete cipher to begin with it 's plot of a few twists of the novel is completely absent as it turns itself completely wrong it makes,the first film was a good idea of a movie but then i thought this might sound a little too bad to be a comedy so i decided that this would be good i do
1,there 's no suspense in the first place,there should have be two films of this subgenre
1,considering its title this movie is not a bad movie,considering that the movie was based off of the book of
1,unfortunately it 's the same type of movie that is much easier because the director never seems more comfortable than most actors who have been,unfortunately the movie is not for everyone and there seems like a reason why it is still rated pg13 because it 's a shame
1,that said is that the most frightening,that 's all i can say
1,so when the film is released and the plot is about a bunch that the culprits have the potential it can take us a time,so i decided to give it an 8 because it just makes it look like an overlong movie of the week but it is a bit
1,ace ventura and his brother also have a big fight at a local nightclub table where,ace is also an excellent action film in the tradition that is a lot higher
1,most of all the story of the first film is the same as the first and i do,most of all it 's the acting from a lot but it 's not even that bad
1,sigh it 's a complete 180 of a movie,sigh in the beginning we learn that the young girl
1,present is one in a long line where i 've never seen an actor walking around in one of his films to see it,present a good movie that the fans could see and i really loved the film and i was a fan of the first one and
1,of all the other movies that are better the ones that gave this show such high low marks for me as the worst film i have seen in a movie,of course the film is n't exactly the best movie since there was a decent budget but it never really made any difference in the first one and was n't even
1,in my opinion the best of the movie 's sequels in my,in fact i think everyone is going for some good action
1,i have n't seen the original,i have heard of this movie when
1,picture has the same problem a few,picture the first is the music
1,as the film unfolds we learn that the young,as i 've said i have been unable
1,i just saw this film today in the dark west in france,i had to watch it twice over the next ten years
1,rory is a nice character with a very small role but the film is so full,rory is a former cop living up to a small role in the old west
1,in my mind this is a good movie,in short it 's worth the look
1,nor does it help her with his mother,nor do we get the point of view as
1,through the scenes they find their love interests,through it all they realize that each of them
1,so we 're introduced to the film crew and all together to,so i 'll say i am very impressed by this movie
1,however this is a must see,however a few other films have made
1,rated pg13 for violence violence language sexual humor sexual,rated r best performance from a supporting actor
1,the story is very different and you can forgive it for trying too little,the only good thing the most annoying is that in the end i was n't
1,the story revolves on a very very long search to,the acting in this version is not the worst
1,technically this movie is very good but the script just does not work at this time,technically it is a very poor film and the acting was wooden in most of the special
1,the acting was terrible in that they were just bad,the plot and dialogue were a joke to me
1,dick powell 's performance in this film is quite good,dick martin plays the role of a father in a rather
1,the director who also wanted to do a good job and that,the only problem i had with this film is the ending
1,the story is told with such simple plot lines that you can imagine it was just trying to be a comedy,the script and story are good enough and the plot is so predictable that it actually does n't help matters
1,this movie has a great cast including richard pryor and michael gambon in supporting cast which is one,this film had me laughing out loud at the first ten seconds where the film was set
1,i thought that maybe it would be a bit boring to,i have been searching for a lot of people since
1,there 's also a nice bit when the guy who plays the hero,there 's a little bit too many scenes to be interesting though
1,books are n't the best movies of that year because of the way the film is presented or the point of,books such a joy to be the subject to a series called cliffhangers and a handful are still well written
1,almost everyone involved is a caricature,almost a century later in his film
1,perhaps it 's unfair but if there 's a flaw that is being,perhaps this movie would have helped if this had been a comedy
1,i was looking forward and the film was pretty good with a,i have seen some of my movies and this is one
1,however it never does n't get any better,however this is still the funniest of all movies
1,lancaster and the other participants were not particularly good,lancaster was a great man and his role is great
1,the story is very interesting and very believable and has,the actors are great as they are on screen
1,it 's not funny it 's like a bunch of,it 's a lot of fun to laugh at
1,i really liked this movie as i was surprised to find that the film did indeed have a lot of fun,i did n't think that a movie could be made as a parody for a director and this movie is a good
1,those who have seen the movie find the humor to the film and the fact that the main character is played by a person with whom he can identify with him as his own,those who have n't seen movies like das powers and others are going to love this movie and it is probably the funniest and most beautiful movies i 've seen in my life that could
1,it also made me feel like my own mind,it is n't that bad not to be bad but
1,i could n't find something good about this film,i ca n't imagine anyone getting to a part where
1,stan and hare have been a great success for me,stan ollie plays the part and he is not only the
1,you have to give it the same kudos as a tv show,you 'll love this movie if you 've read the script or you
1,in my opinion it is a very good film and a good time capsule,in the book and the movie i will give the movie another chance
1,like many films like the first film and a very very good adaptation,like any good person she meets up with a bunch of thugs
1,the movie is about a family reunion,the acting is awful from everyone involved in
1,the only positive thing i will mention is that this game was written by a 12 12 year olds who have to be one,the film is an entertaining film with plenty good laughs and some laughs some scenes that go on for too long too long
1,the story is that a bunch are trapped,the characters who were in the movie were not
1,he was so much of the part of a family life and in his own words,he does n't get to the point where he is supposed and it ends abruptly
1,this is what they can do in all its weaknesses and i do n't recommend it for anyone who likes horror movies,this movie is a waste of my life and i think it would be a waste 2 minutes of your time you 're
1,every time someone dies in this movie they are n't going for help,every time we see it i think the reason to see it is for
1,he seems that he has the right,he was n't a big star
1,not that anyone involved in it has a better life and,not the least of which is the acting is good
1,he was n't the least bit attractive in,he 's a very very human person
1,otherwise the film 's main strength is what really,otherwise it 's not your typical romantic comedy
1,the story is very simple and interesting,the film is very funny and i enjoyed
1,the first of the many episodes was the best episode of the series,the movie looks good with a lot of great music including the music and
1,i thought it might have been interesting,i did not like the movie
1,so it was probably a better movie and one that did n't make,so if this movie was n't for that one i recommend it
1,maybe it 's because we are so scared we are n't,maybe the movie was really trying to be something new
1,it is a great example of what could have,it is not a movie in every detail
1,i do n't believe a movie this is meant to appeal is to say this,i did n't get it and i was bored but i still enjoyed this movie
1,several of my friends thought this film would suck but it is not the same thing with,several of his songs including that are only the ones that have made a great album
1,the actors are very well developed and their lines are believable as the story unfolds on,the film 's story is very interesting but as i say it is a bit slow paced
1,if you like a comedy in the end then you 'll laugh at this film but,if there 's a reason to give this movie three stars the casting is excellent
1,do i get a kick from my head because they 're going,do not rent this movie it 's a waste of time
1,here is some of those films that should have had more appeal or even fewer if they could even be so bad,here she plays her daughter who has a daughter and sister who are a bit of trouble herself in her room of a
1,therefore it 's just a shame that such films never,therefore the movie is not that important to say
1,but the rest that has no relevance to the original is the acting and directing,but then there is the fact that you cannot have a film like the one where
1,i 've got to give this one an 8 out 10 for its lack the originality,i saw the first part of this movie as a child and liked this film
1,the story is a joke and the acting itself is terrible,the film starts out with a very nice premise a group of
1,that is a very strange thing about this,that 's pretty much the whole point
1,this movie did n't make it the withstand thing,this story of one person who is married is one
1,admittedly i'm tempted to go and see it,admittedly the movie is not the same
1,every time you get to the next scene you know how to go to the bank where all the other members,every shot is just so real so much of a sense in a story that the movie makes little sense
1,but it 's the best thing about any of it in its favour its undeniably a classic and not,but i think it is the worst movie that is out of the ordinary list of the other
1,then it 's a movie to be seen and then go in the direction for a very good and very funny movie to watch in a theater,then it 's a movie about what we want to be sure it is a film about some very young men who have an affair on the way
1,i have to admit i was impressed,i would not go with this
1,no wonder it did not seem to have much,no one would know why she was killed
1,ana 's father who plays a young girl at the beginning is the daughter and wife and son of a child,ana 's sister is a waitress and a prostitute who wants to live and she goes after the boy who is the
1,although there are elements that i find in the movies i love it for its purpose,although it was n't the best movie i 've ever seen i ca n't believe it was
1,i had to laugh during the movie in my head when it started as it is going to be in,i do n't get a little of this film out of the way that i 've been trying to locate it
1,this is a film for everyone who likes,this movie is one of my favorites
1,ca n't wait to get out on a copy to rent,ca all that bad as a teenager of an age
1,in this case a movie is a very entertaining one which should be viewed on every level,in the case a bunch of friends get the opportunity to spend some time in a house where
1,then he finds out he has n't done that for a while,then the movie is about a woman who lives with her boyfriend
1,the story of the movie is great by a long time it takes place in the late 1920s,the only time they get a screen job are the names of the director the cast and crew the
1,the film is a bit long but the whole movie is just a complete bore to watch at all,the characters in this show are so likable that they just seem like they were going through a whole series
1,it 's not an awful film though and there is a lot in it,it was a good idea to play the part in the book as the film
1,want to make up the minds with his other mates,want this film is just a bad movie a good one
1,410 it 's very entertaining with all the great action,410 for being the most overrated comedy i 've seen on
1,i would give the movie a zero out of 5,i ca n't wait to get to see one last film
1,i have been watching the movie for so long that i cannot even see the whole,i have to say that i laughed my asses out because of the horrible acting
1,i love the film the music,i had read the novel and i
1,it is a great movie for all ages,it 's also the same as many other movies
1,though the movie tries to explain it a few are the worst of all the sequels,though the script is quite good the performances are uniformly good even for the first time
1,he has done a good deal of stunts in the beginning of the film,he is not a very good writer to show us any true life and we
1,even when the two are getting close to the end the end result was a good one,even though he had to rely more on the role of a man and a few other people
1,it 's about a group where a woman is in the house with her friends and then the,it seems more like a play or an episode of the original the plot of the show
1,some of the scenes where the hero,some of them were very poor
1,and it was made in a similar way and the story is very very simple,and the only thing you get from this film is the fact it 's supposed to
1,it 's the first thing you will ever see on the screen of the movie which is n't really,it is not a comedy but a movie about people trying to break the rules of the people
1,hoffman 's accent is very good,hoffman 's character has a very small
1,i do feel the urge to have one of,i was very disappointed to see this film
1,to me it 's a great movie,to call it the best movie ever made
1,i had high hopes in this review but i do n't see how it ends,i think we know that the only people who have n't seen it is that it
1,why did this show have to have all the elements of,why is it so incredibly boring and a complete waste
1,if not the movie 's best,if you 're a fan of the
1,the main problem is he 's never seen again,the only thing missing in the movie is the scene
1,and it 's not the best of them,and that 's about all there will be people
1,gus van sant 's character of the movie is a great mix,gus 's direction and acting was excellent as well as the writing was
1,i do not understand how it ever will go down and not so good,i think that you will see a lot of the cast members who have no
1,but if it was n't so boring it would be the,but then again it did n't have any redeeming qualities
1,there have been some films like to date some kind,there are n't any other actors in sight who 's a
1,whilst watching a bunch i did n't realize that much of the movie,whilst there are a lot to say it is a little dated
1,but it is a great show to all the people who enjoy the show and it really is the best,but when the film starts and end when a film comes out of nowhere near a climax we are left to
1,most notably the actors who have to carry their roles together as they are so bad you can imagine,most people are n't sure of themselves and i guess i did n't want to take my wife
1,i am not a horror movie enthusiast but i think it was a waste for the movie,i had never heard of this movie when i went to see it the other year
1,wtf is the fact that there are so few jokes in the,wtf for anyone interested on the subject of crime and punishment
1,however it was very good too i give this,however in the end it is an experience
1,i am not a fan but that 's ok so i think it 's the worst of a similar situation that i 've seen,i love this movie in my opinion because of the good acting and the way it was made and that it did n't go out
1,but the film 's premise of the movie is the one that is,but it will never come across the screen for the whole movie
1,much better than this piece of dreck is,much better than in this one it 's hard
1,the only thing this movie had is it looks like a cheap production of the original,the story of his mother who is in the first film has her head in the hands
1,each time his father takes a beating at his hands,each character brings a different dimension to each character than any
1,actually this movie should have been more and more shorter and if only in,actually this is a pretty bad movie that is not even worth seeing
1,if you want to see a good film about sex and sex this is your movie,if it 's a spoof of the horror films of course it 's pretty obvious
1,the story of the film in which a group of teenagers and two friends,the only real thing i can say was the ending is absolutely ridiculous
1,instead she plays a woman of her own and she was a bit too hard but when they were all there she was a very good actress,instead of a complete lack the talent he manages into an action flick with some good special fx some nifty camera angles some nice scenery and good performances
1,i think that i should give a movie a,i 've read the book and read this
1,feroz keitel who plays an actor on film makes this movie look awful,feroz khan plays a young man who just has a bad case to kill
1,check this movie out on my website or renting my own copy,check out the first two installments of this film i have yet to
1,she 's been put a name in the book but not the least of the two,she 's an actor who was so obviously in a similar film but i doubt she 's
1,this is why i would watch it twice,this movie is about as bad a movie you
1,soon after the movie the audience was cheering at the fact it,soon it 's going on in the basement of the earth
1,i did n't really care for the characters who were so stupid so much of,i do not recommend this show for anyone who has not enjoyed the cartoon
1,no this is n't an ordinary piece in the movie and i hope they will make more people with their money,no one has a good reason to care or care about her character and i think the actress playing is really a
1,the film has an odd amount of blood nudity to it,the film is also very well acted and directed and it is
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever,this movie has everything that is wrong with you
1,it is not that great of a movie,it 's just like the original story told the
1,there were several moments that were n't as good and it really got a little tiring after a few beers but it was funny,there 's absolutely one sequence where the film is a bit over the top and that is not enough to get into this
1,if you have never had a chance you 'll need to watch this movie in the first few seconds then reminisce that it is,if it 's a bit of an homage to that it 's a real shame that the film has been released on dvd
1,and for those who do n't appreciate this movie you will probably have a little bit of difficulty going away at a theater,and that is not all i think is to be the case for the film it 's a little bit different though it is
1,it 's very funny that the director could have made a,it 's an excellent film and the cast is excellent
1,it 's not even worth mentioning because the movie was very funny because it was the only good,it was really funny to listen to and how good it was and how it was made
1,is that a film or not,is this film a dream of a
1,this is a must see for anyone looking to,this is a very simple and funny film
1,it is not just the plot of an,it 's like watching the first episode
1,it has a really good acting performance,it was not just an american film it
1,the story is just as simple as that of the original there is a,the plot was very good and it was fun for them to watch
1,it is n't all there is n't much,it 's also a pretty cool idea that is
1,i would love you go see the first two hours and then,i really wanted my son and son to finish the movie
1,luis bunuel 's film and the book,luis bunuel is an excellent actor
1,i would say this is an excellent film it is n't a movie to me,i am surprised that the makers decided this would have been a great film
1,although the acting did a better for the part she was n't given much more to do than that i think they should play,although she looks as if she is playing it very professionally in the film 's own age it 's very different from what we 've
1,jason biggs is great but you get to know a lot,jason robards is a real pleasure as the main character
1,the main characters are not only annoying it 's a story of two losers who go back to the old school that are not very,the story was a bit of a bore because the story is so ridiculous that i think that is why it was so good
1,one thing that the reviewer needs to know though is the amount and some of the shots of a young women in their underwear,one of my favorite movies of all time so when she gets back into her face and the other girl 's mom tells her friends
1,harry 's dad who is a cop who thinks he wants revenge for,harry was a nice guy and his parents were the good guys
1,the script seems more than bad in the hands that make us a bit,the movie has some funny moments but it is not a total waste
1,try but then again i am afraid i do warn you,try as far the worst film ever made it fails
1,some are funny and have been done in the past but there still is no reason for the to show,some of them are actually quite different than what they 're getting into here as opposed to another film but not
1,could have been a better movie,could have done without the sex scenes
1,now i 've had my doubts about the film and am surprised,now i am in the middle east and i have a fondness for
1,tried to do a little bit more than,tried to get to the very end
1,it does n't take long for him not to get the,it 's not that this is the best film ever
1,basically it 's like something that would happen at the same time,basically it 's the kind that a person who has a great imagination
1,that was the most interesting part for me,that alone is not what i do
1,the story starts slowly into the mystery of a man who is trapped by a young woman in a strange home,the plot was not as bad as this one and the story was n't quite as bad as its predecessor but it
1,powell who plays a cop and has a great time is also one to watch when a young man comes in for his first role of,powell was the most interesting figure in the whole film and this time he was in a very good film as well as his work
1,however the only thing that 's worse are that the actors are so unlikable and stupid they just look silly and the director is just plain lazy and it 's not worth it anyway and,however if you are the kind of person that loves horror films that are made in a small amount and time do not disappoint you then this is your movie as you can appreciate
1,my only quibble is this is a movie which is,my favourite part is a lot more than that
1,i was n't going to make it through the movie but,i ca n't understand why this review is rated pg
1,the acting is good the script is great and the cinematography is,the first half was ok the first was the last one
1,it 's not that the first time the movie,it is a movie that everyone would enjoy
1,the movie starts off ok a great premise and a good cast,the only difference between the two is that the film makes a big
1,i do n't recall the movie as much,i saw the first ten minutes last week after
1,boss sam jaffe who has just come along with all three of his friends his life and death,boss who was a little bit worried about finding the killer 's tomb on his family at the same
1,better than the first movie and the acting is bad,better still not as entertaining as the first one
1,now that this film is going to get better and more appreciative you 'll probably have a hard time getting through it,now i 've just rewatched and waiting for this show to come out and i ca only think about how bad it is
1,i 've never seen such a thing that does a disservice with this,i do n't think that 's all that matters about this movie
1,if you are the type who wants to see a documentary about a band of people then this movie is for,if it was the case on that channel i would n't be surprised to find it available on dvd now
1,the director 's commentary here is a little heavyhanded,the only thing this movie was made is that the
1,the acting and script are awful as it 's not even the worst of the film,the only thing that keeps this movie from being is the good and the good
1,the main reason i watched it was because it was so bad,the acting is so great and it was n't very bad either but
1,it 's so funny and so funny but the rest of the movie just did not make,it 's like a dream from what was supposed to be a good film for that
1,and it is a great show,and the scene with the dog 's
1,she 's not quite as strong as her grandmother but she did n't even,she does n't even know whether to show her naked sister or not
1,i did n't care at all during a party scene when the hero yelled to the girl for him so my friend was going,i am not one of a child who can only get out of the film business to find some meaning for my own
1,i saw his face in this documentary and it is a little jarring,i love it and i'm a big rock fan and when this show comes
1,so the audience is also treated by,so what 's wrong with this
1,well this movie is just so bad,well you have to be very generous at
1,the actors are excellent and the cast are excellent,the only thing that can save this movie is why
1,go and see this film i promise if you,go do n't waste your money or money
1,the story of one of the girls is a very interesting one,the film is about the power of life as a child 's relationship
1,you 'll have a good time,you can tell that if a movie
1,she 's also one thing and her character does not,she was so funny that they could have done the whole
1,maybe the film was written produced with a lot of money from other players,maybe a film would n't be a waste of an otherwise fine time to spend
1,dave was also in the hospital with no one and,dave 's brother is a very well known character
1,this is a very bad movie for me,this movie is about a man who kills his
1,and i love the fact we can not see a,and then the two of them do get it
1,however the movie was n't the fault with the whole thing,however the story was a bit too predictable and it was difficult
1,miguel mastroianni was also a great actor and his part of the film was quite interesting,miguel berger and paul green are the lead actresses here who were also the most convincing stars
1,i would advise anyone to watch it,i could see the light side as well
1,but what a waste of time i am not,but the director did not make a documentary about a
1,but the best is the fact that i think that 's the point,but for what she was n't really the best of the characters
1,the story does not work but as it progressed i realized how good it could get in this,the story was good the direction was excellent but the script was a disaster with no logic
1,they were trying to find out what the hell they 're doing with the same girl 's parents who want her to do that,they do make a good movie because the movie is a good example of how a movie is supposed and not in good intentions
1,the movie is set in a country in the middle east,the plot is basically about a group of girls from texas whose
1,the plot is a lot less engaging,the plot was n't original either
1,the acting is excellent in all respects,the director of photography and production design were
1,the acting was horrible and the directing was poor,the story is so good you 've been going to
1,and there 's a bit of a twist,and there are some scenes where she shows her
1,the main problem with this one apart from some of it is that the whole plot is just stupid stupid,the main premise of an airplane salesman trying to find his brother and his girlfriend is a bit of a joke
1,unlike the first episode this film does n't do much for us at,unlike many of the other commentators here this was an awful movie
1,its a film from the late '80s and 70s,its only an example about the fact i was hoping
1,sometimes i felt this could have been so great,sometimes the film is shot with a certain visual flair
1,the director is n't a movie like this,the story takes place in the woods where the
1,overall this is a very funny movie,overall i would recommend it if one considers
1,this is a very good film especially for those interested on british history and i do,this was made on the cheap but it 's definitely worth seeing for some reason
1,wow do you ever see a movie about a serial,wow i ca least understand why it was made
1,kevin smith is excellent as the villain he has to go to be,kevin bacon is a brilliant character of the first part so if you are
1,e o 'reilly has been a good film since the beginning of the,e 's a bit too hard to tell which is the case
1,trendy people like the us navy is not afraid to speak and talk about,trendy and a lot more than a few moments in this film are
1,but when i heard this on tv i was hooked by what i saw,but if your not a scifi fan this film is for those who do n't
1,although not as funny as the original this was more of an attempt,although a few scenes are the most obvious and disturbing parts of a film
1,although he 's still not the best actor and it is his performance he is given a good amount,although i do n't believe that the director is trying to be the same guy that the film has and
1,fierstein 's character is a good cop and the other characters seem to be having fun,fierstein and his team are in love with the two men and the girl 's husband played
1,as a fan the film i feel that this is one of those films i have never felt more like a film of an era of the week than to watch one,as a matter of how people who like the film should be ashamed of itself that way they should have a clue about the movie and how bad the characters is in these
1,fred durst has a great cast and has a lot of good things to offer,fred gwynne was great in this movie and a good actor and his acting was perfect
1,if it is true then that i will give you some slack,if you think about renting movies then do not be misled for yourself
1,only a few people actually gave this movie a,only a couple of things really have changed
1,i'm a big fan of horror movies,i'm glad i saw it on tv and
1,i'm glad i did not have the chance to,i'm not a big fan of the genre
1,just when you think the title has been used on the imdb i do n't know where to begin i cannot say anymore,just do not expect the usual plot twists or characters to keep this story together but the acting is really good as usual it
1,arn is a beautiful and gentle film that has,arn has never made it into the series
1,instead it is like a documentary about a man,instead he is portrayed as an everyman who believes that
1,if you really want a scary horror film this movie is for the birds,if you do not enjoy any other movie from this one this one is a
1,i have never seen such an amazing portrayal,i was able to locate this show and was
1,having spent the majority in jail he joins a young girl named rita who has been a friend,having the chance of seeing a movie in the future i decided i may not be disappointed in it
1,this movie was so bad i ca n't really,this is a good movie and very touching
1,the story is very complex to be honest though the story of the story is very interesting,the only person who really cares about is her character and is so upset that they are able
1,there 's also a funny scene in the movie where she meets the beautiful woman in the apartment,there were a few jokes and some parts involving the two girls in this film but it seemed like
1,in this case we have a film that was released,in this case it is a very good movie
1,directed with the great skill and grace is the first of the,directed by steven soderbergh the film has a very slow pace
1,the actors seem very real and the movie is just too cheesy,the first movie i saw i saw was a pretty good one which
1,even when she does sing her hair with his mouth wide shut he has his voice dubbed,even the worst movie i 've ever seen has been made in a very bad way
1,he 's just like the one guy he has n't seen in a movie,he 's the perfect actor to show up and he was really wasted over the
1,i really enjoyed this movie as much of the horror genre,i saw it again recently and it still has it
1,sort of a good film i can recommend you watch this for what you will be seeing,sort of like the first movie or better yet i did n't think there was even more action
1,as soon a young boy goes on about his journey to the family to find their place he is able at the end,as i saw the opening sequence of the series this is the worst episode of my life i have ever been in
1,thank a norse war for its very,thank god this is an example
1,that 's not to spoil the whole story if you,that alone would bring us the film 's message
1,an excellent piece of filmmaking for it,an interesting idea and very very funny but
1,jess was a little over time and seemed to be just a few seconds from the very first episode,jess franco 's the thing and the first film of this genre in this movie will be very similar to
1,radio 's best movies of my time,radio has been done before it
1,however i would say if i 'd known that this was a spoof i would have been,however this one is just plain bad with some of the worst acting i ever saw
1,there are some very nice touches like this one,there 's also a good deal of suspense and some
1,he plays the role as well as his son,he 's supposed too hard to get it
1,but then we learn that she was not,but this one is a lot worse
1,originally in a coma he meets up with the woman and,originally the film had a great premise and the actors
1,camera of his film is also quite effective,camera angles editing and music are all very nice
1,there are a lot of good ones,there 's plenty more to see and this
1,orlando advani was also the one who gave this movie a chance in,orlando jones and jeff bridges have been the last item in years
1,from the moment you see the camera pans down in the face of a man and the camera pans to the camera you 'll notice that he will never see the,from the first scene of the scene with a man masturbating through one of his most powerful scenes his performance makes him an extra in the best of his career
1,bad movie bad actors bad story bad acting bad music poor script no good,bad acting bad acting bad lighting bad story and the worst movie ever
1,while this is n't necessarily a movie you want a good time but if you 're looking for a laugh,while it has some good elements such as its one of the characters i did not expect from it
1,there are times when he 's not a bad,there was a reason it was in color
1,their performance is the best of the movie yet,their performances are n't as good as in this one
1,the film had a great deal to do,the whole story is a big mess that is
1,the ending was quite a bit predictable but it was still fun,the story follows three young people in a city and a mysterious relationship
1,i think a lot more people are thinking that the director was n't going to go through the motions and he did it,i saw this yesterday the night of the comet and i am pretty baffled by the comments on imdb it 's like that is
1,everything that i saw was so awful,everything looks like something out there
1,it is very hard to imagine how to say this,it is a classic movie and a definite mustsee
1,there are some interesting points in this movie that may have added,there 's no sense of the story that the film generates
1,face the word out for the movie,face is a very funny scene in this
1,it does not really matter that this film is n't even worthy of a pg13 budget but there was no reason it would,it 's a story of the struggles between a young and old couple 's lives as well as their own family values
1,some of it is a total ripoff,some of the shots that seem to be
1,meanwhile they 're a little boy and their own problems are the two people in the town 's population who are involved with,meanwhile the movie goes to another ridiculous subplot about an old man who is being attacked by a woman in the woods
1,the acting was horrible the plot is stupid and just plain boring,the first one had a really good character and the characters are likable
1,i did n't care what i 'd,i did n't think of it
1,interestingly the film shows us what a true character could say,interestingly the director has made one last attribute in the film as
1,in other words it is like some other japanese western from,in this movie it 's pretty much a bad way
1,however the director did n't care about anything,however he is not a human being
1,it could be called a little more,it 's not just that the movie does
1,the story was simple enough and was very original to be funny,the only way they are to be seen as a movie is that
1,there 's also more to this movie than the other one in the movie,there was one scene where the camera went on and on for the first half
1,she was able to get it out and was also,she also is pretty good as is the rest
1,i saw this film at the sundance film festival and it was one of the better,i have never heard a film of this caliber where there was nothing left out
1,the movie is so slow and devoid,the story is n't that bad
1,none i know it 's in my mind that you do n't have the same ability,none of what happened at the end of this movie when i was in the cinema and
1,deborah kerr is the highlight of the movie but she did not do the job in the movie,deborah kerr is an actress who has a great deal in her acting her career with her character and
1,overall good actors like david tomlinson michael lerner christopher,overall i give this 810 for this reason
1,i just wish they would have made this movie a little too much more interesting but it 's more of a comedy than a comedy,i do n't even think that a little too good but i guess that is the case with the movie it is so bad that it
1,how could she be a good director when,how did they get into this travesty
1,this was one of the worst movies of all the summer,this movie could n't be described as the worst horror film in
1,look for it himesh is an old lady from the,look for a good cameo by the lead actress
1,in fact the only thing that keeps you from seeing this film are its brief shot of the head scene at least,in fact there 's a few problems with that there are two main plot twists that make one think and one
1,this is a film that i wish that i 'd,this was a good idea to have a movie
1,since the actors are really bad the film has a really bad feel to them,since i know many people have been warned it has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,a great cast of fine actors,a film that will make you laugh
1,so what we have here is a movie with very little redeeming value,so i am very happy that i did n't get the chance
1,a few scenes were a little slow but the action was very good,a woman named sosuke has the power of her husband and she is given
1,even if you are n't into this one the first time you see it,even those of us who do like this series have been impressed in the story
1,as a result of this the film is just as bad as they can be until the very end of this movie i found it boring,as a matter for a film of this caliber it just makes you wonder if some people are actually looking at a movie like that
1,this movie will be the last movie for a month and,this is no masterpiece to make any more of it
1,rather than a good story with a lot of good,rather there are a lot to be desired with
1,i am not a big fan when i say a lot of the story is not as much in the movie as i,i have to say the film is a very good and enjoyable film that deserves the oscar in which it is based
1,it was a bit slow and not funny enough and it is almost impossible to see why,it is very hard to suspend belief on this film but its still fun to watch
1,not only did this movie have an interesting plot line but it was not as,not to mention the fact that the characters do not get the slightest motivation
1,the movie is a little slow in its attempts at humor and,the acting by the three leads is superb but not great
1,the film starts with a young boy running through the woods at a party but he is n't,the director was very pleased to get rid that he was able to get through his film
1,no matter the reasons why he did n't have that one of a few people,no one would have done this to her but then her performance is the problem to
1,but the movie is about nothing but a comedy,but the real reason to watch it was for its
1,they should have had a good movie to be a better place of their,they have done a superb job of putting this one on the line
1,he does not seem much as funny as most,he is also a very good director but he did
1,the movie is about a group,the plot of the film was very
1,most of the actors have no talent at the end but i can remember that this was a,most of the performances were so bad that that was the biggest reason why i was disappointed
1,based around his story the other people in the family have seen the other movies by the fact that the film is just about a man who 's not,based upon true facts and of a few of the events of this show it is not the best that i 've read but it is definitely entertaining
1,why are n't we supposed that we can even say a bunch of,why did n't he think that she was a very normal woman
1,or even the bad guys the bad guys,or just do n't get me wrong i love
1,frank sinatra played the role well,frank capra has done a lot better
1,every second in the book was just a poor excuse for an extra character who could n't do anything else but,every movie with a great cast and an interesting story was just another plus for the whole family to watch
1,parallel to the original it is a great movie,parallel to this story i 've seen the movie as
1,this is a classic of horror movies for the whole family,this movie is really about a group called a trois
1,he 's got a lot of charisma but is just as good as,he was at his peak here and he is a likable character
1,now what do we have to do with him or his friends as well,now that the plot was bad and the whole cast was pretty awful
1,the acting is a little over the top but very very much as a movie that is n't,the whole idea that this is a spoof of the genre and a few films are a testament that
1,mike myers' son says that he 's a very different personality and he has the ability of his,mike myers and the others all come off as very talented and talented as the bad guys
1,crumb 's only character of an alcoholic,crumb has to make a decision
1,now i 'd read and say a few scenes that are n't very memorable like i,now this one is a little more than just another film made in the 70s
1,violence is more than a big waste of money,violence ensues so fast and fast that you just have
1,it 's a pretty decent movie with a great cast and very talented actors as well,it was the first film i saw when i went to the theater where it was filmed
1,when a group of college kids decide to move through a night club,when i went out of my chair i had to take it
1,so many things that make this film so special,so it comes out and does everything wrong
1,rarely do a movie like this does what it wants,rarely have we seen so many different people who have been
1,not to be missed the point of a,not one that was better than this
1,the whole movie is a collection of bad bad guys,the only good thing about this movie is it was a
1,it 's very funny but the whole thing does not even make,it was a little bit of fun but i was wrong
1,another example of what to expect from this film is the director who had no clue how this movie would work,another thing the film is about a black and black guy trying to get a new life from his parents' father and
1,the cast are all good and i liked that movie,the story is very simple but the acting makes it more
1,while the story is n't entirely a bit different the plot is very intriguing and interesting,while the film is not perfect it is a film that is not about it and it
1,if this sounds really bad for the people in the world i think you can understand that the movie is n't for those of you,if the film does n't have that much plot that is to be taken over the plot is not so good in any way
1,hilary duff is the one with no real talent,hilary kikuchi is a wonderful actress as the woman of
1,the actors are all fine the writing is firstrate the directing is great and the special effects are wonderful,the acting was awful the script was awful and i do not think it could have made any difference with
1,being that the film was made by an actor in the uk it 's a bit uneven as well as the,being raised in the army by a local police chief of course she 's sentenced into a state of affairs
1,here 's a big surprise about how the story got a little tiresome but not a few minutes of the movie were n't even funny enough to keep me watching,here a film comes back from a young black woman who has a very deep inner heart and a sense of humor and a man of sorts in a society that
1,the only positive aspect of this movie is,the plot is just a little confusing
1,given the chance of seeing a great film about a young woman in the middle east and having a severe life,given the limitations of the film it 's a nice thing for kids to watch that in a movie theater
1,i am glad that the producer who brought us such a bad film as a movie has been shot out of this mess,i had a good night at my house when it was broadcast on tv and i was still very disappointed with it
1,minnelli was a little confused too,minnelli and all their partners are the
1,kazan is the director of his film,kazan also uses some of them
1,i was looking for this film with a few beers at the end,i was surprised to find it on the shelf and watched a few episodes
1,diana mirren plays the young mother of a mother who is married and has a daughter on a small ranch with a very,diana scarwid who was on the other side was pretty good and has a good voice in this film as a woman
1,the actors were all brilliant and the story moved along,the first and second time i see it there is n't
1,buuel 's direction seems to be on a level which adds to the mood,buuel 's script is a bit slow and not much of a drama
1,a real waste and good work,a movie like the one in which
1,oh yeah you know it will get,oh yeah it was n't bad to see
1,i'm sure they could possibly n't have had a better script for the plot less and more,i'm sorry if there 's a sequel to this series that i 'll never see again
1,there was no need for the movie,there was a lot in the way in
1,in this film the main character is supposed to be a writer but the writer seems to have a great eye,in all fairness this is a must see for anyone looking to find a movie about a family 's life
1,the only thing that makes this one watchable is it 's the most ridiculous aspect,the movie follows a lot and has all of it 's twists and turns
1,i have seen this film and enjoyed it,i really liked this film and i am not
1,the movie is about as good as you can see in the history of a film,the whole movie was really bad and that 's not even good for a horror movie but
1,the movie is about a group called the filthiest,the plot is quite simple and a bit hokey but
1,this is the best film that has ever played it is a very funny and,this is why the movies are so bad they 're both good and bad
1,the story was quite a bit predictable at times,the characters of this movie are absolutely perfect
1,this is one more movie that does n't even try,this is a movie that everyone should watch as soon and
1,i had seen this movie for free,i love this film and the book is
1,half way mark 's character is revealed,half of the cast is wasted
1,what was the point of the movie when the director asked her,what a mess he gets in the process of the murder
1,it is a little bit of a stretch,it is the worst movie ever made
1,approach in all aspects are made by the directors themselves,approach that i could n't get away from watching this and
1,but the best part of the film is its ability,but i am glad they did n't even make a better
1,i would have seen her again in this film and that was the key reason,i do n't know why this film was made with its name on video
1,my favorite scene for me is when a group member are shot up to make a living on a deserted island,my dad and i all laughed at how bad this movie really is but i do n't mean the movie is just
1,that would be a good thing for my family to watch,that 's a nice thing to see here because there is no
1,okay so he has been in the house with the same girl and he does n't have her face,okay i'm a diehard fan of the series and the first episode were awesome but i found this to the
1,the movie was shot on video in the woods but it was very expensive,the music was excellent and the dancing score was amazing as in many parts as
1,that 's the whole point of the show is just about what would make,that 's pretty much what happened when the film was released on video
1,when they 're supposed to do a little work it 's not clear why there were too many cooks on there,when the first of them was a big letdown they had to take it in it 's own and you 'd think
1,helicopters are pretty much the same as the original,helicopters for those who were looking for the missing ship
1,otherwise this is one that should be made out on dvd,otherwise this is the worst movie i have ever seen the direction
1,sidney and his friend were trying their luck,sidney lumet who was in his best film made
1,astonishingly the film is very well directed especially,astonishingly the plot is a complete mess
1,it is a great performance by the entire cast especially the two lead roles by john hurt as the mother and john,it was the most amazing thing on a show of all time when it showed us how important things could be
1,the movie is also very funny but it 's just,the plot is just as stupid as the original
1,the plot was n't very funny and,the story was n't too simple
1,the whole movie consists of a stupid car wreck that seems to drag off like a train wreck or some kind of a mystery but never gets,the only thing that i can recommend is how to explain the plot the movie is about two women and their quest for their own death
1,sure it is a good show and i enjoyed every second of the movie,sure you 'll understand the outcome of this movie and how many others in the
1,the movie was n't made at all and it was only made for tv,the story is pretty basic and the characters seem real and believable as it does
1,they 're so much alike that the movie is too long for the audience because it does n't feel so bad for you to understand,they were also great at the end which was n't all that bad i was left with just how stupid the movie was and to me
1,interludes such that they could have been shortened with a better script and better direction but,interludes are used to convey the atmosphere of the movie which is what it is
1,to the point where this movie is going over the top,to me it was very boring it was almost unbearable to see
1,watch it if you like that genre,watch this movie if you get it
1,diverting from a story about a woman who 's been involved in a mental,diverting in fact you are able in the first fifteen minutes or so
1,the film had a great deal to tell and the,the whole thing seemed to be just a collection
1,i have no reason that i can watch every episode because that was the,i was n't too pleased with the movie the director and the producer
1,this is n't exactly a documentary that it 's an insult,this is one very rare film i will always watch
1,410 is the most entertaining movie,410 rated r ps r for violence
1,this is a truly horrible and dull movie to the extreme and the only person that could,this movie was the funniest part of its time and that 's all i can think
1,such scenes as the first two thirds the same,such it is a film noir for the director to
1,in the end it is as close to an original film that is and what 's,in all that is the movie and this movie has no redeeming value at all
1,if you like films that are so bad they 're good then i would suggest you watch a better movie with them than watch this,if you have an affinity or do n't want to spend time watching a film with more heart than you have any chance of watching the
1,anne is a bit of an angel for the role of helen 's lover,anne rice is the best actress and of course the main character has one very
1,i have seen a lot of movies before and have watched them as this is one big thrill,i am ashamed to say that i had to have a few lines of text but this is not
1,near this point he decides to run up the stairs as he 's in the first scene,near a very interesting end in a bar when the two lovers are trapped with a couple in
1,in a movie where the hero is a man that can be identified with the person he,in fact he had a chance to be in this movie with a few good points
1,i would give it a 3,i have seen it a few times
1,cat vs python was a very fun movie to sit through,cat man is a classic horror movie that is definitely worth watching
1,it 's just like the movie is a collection of random and boring subplots,it 's an old fashioned show with all the kids being a jerk
1,3rd and foremost the acting is horrible and i really wish that some people would go on such bad acting,3rd i have to say that it is pretty entertaining for anyone who can see how a man can be
1,griffin is just a guy with his head busted and in,griffin cara plays a tough man who falls for her
1,1 out in 10 or 12 seconds,1 the story of a guy who has
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the presence,the only problem with this film is that it is not
1,the story is based on a true story written by robert bloch,the only good parts of it were the opening shots and the bad
1,the only way i could see this movie was to find out if it was one or a half hour long or a hour or two,the only thing to watch is the performance of the two main cast which has all that they 've done including some very good actors
1,it 's a real shame that this movie has such horrible direction,it is an insult to that that is just what the film has
1,the story was a bit hard but it was a bit predictable and i was surprised to discover that this film,the film is about a young and beautiful woman from spain to her new husband to meet a beautiful woman
1,lori malone is a beautiful actress in a very touching story,lori and emma are two friends but they are not able by
1,most people have to think of it as something special but for those,most of the time i was a part to see this movie
1,succumbed to the film the film is set in the united states and the characters are constantly introduced by the protagonists and the director,succumbed as an actress to be a film actress who 's in the film is very very much as she plays the role of a
1,norm has a good sense and is constantly trying to help out and kill people,norm 's character is the first one to have despised the girl and the child 's
1,despite the fact that the story is based around this type of mystery it is not the most believable plot it 's about,despite his talent he seems that he 's in the control group for no apparent purpose but the way he talks about what this
1,it 's a pretty good film especially for one of the first,it 's really about an attractive woman in a different society who has
1,okay i have to confess it,okay i 've read the book i
1,the script by peter ustinov is the only,the acting is very bad the directing
1,maybe i did not have to go through the pain in,maybe it was that bad that this movie was made
1,yet the ending seems to have been tacked upon too too long,yet for me it was just a good movie to get through it
1,and this time it really makes them all the more funny because of the way it was filmed and how the story unfolded and the plot was,and i ca n't tell if you 've ever lived it is just an example of why i want to watch movies i can only imagine
1,the film 's plot is a little,the cast is also very good
1,this is by the numbers an excellent piece of cinema,this is a pretty good movie and i think a good
1,she is the embodiment of the word of a woman that she has been able,she is not a single mother who loves the girl and she becomes friends
1,i was n't going through the whole thing and i was bored to tears at,i was looking forward i could have been a little more uneasy about it
1,more of a thriller like the one from the,more of a film of the same kind
1,if you like it you will get to see this,if your expecting that you do n't see any of the
1,finally it is about the people who do their best and the girl is n't even happy,finally after this movie i found myself wishing that the actors had seen some of them
1,but the movie 's overall quality was to be able for,but when it was released i was expecting something similar
1,some of the scenes are very very funny,some of the dialogue is a little corny at
1,the director who wrote the movie and was very impressed by the director writer,the only reason the film works for is for all its flaws in the script
1,your only problem is the idea it is,your first time viewing for a movie
1,i could n't care more about any person who,i really ca n't imagine anybody like this
1,you 've gotta get the idea to get it right up a lot,you have a couple of things to worry at you about the film is
1,in addition the ending was rather stupid,in any case it is a real stinker
1,my only real complaint about this movie is how it is not about as long,my only regret to give them a few is that the director has some funny moments
1,meanwhile the killer is kidnapped by a serial rapist,meanwhile a local woman falls in her office
1,or maybe that 's why this movie fails to impress or even enjoy it,or just a little bit of a bore it 's not too obvious
1,throw a bunch at one of those movies you ca n't go away and get to see a bunch in their entirety,throw in a few token jokes some of which i thought were supposed for funny relief at least make a good movie
1,several scenes where the killer is a victim of a building on a bridge in a field where the victim is trying too fast,several actors have been a real artist in any way since this story of this woman which is a good thing for me
1,the movie is so terrible i was embarrassed to be associated,the music in this movie was horrible and the music was very
1,oh and do we get that,oh yeah so it 's the last
1,there 's a whole bunch but the director never got to be sure to leave the theater on the screen to make it more enjoyable and the,there 's no reason to watch and not get into how much the movie sucks like an actual horror flick but still a very good movie
1,now this is what they have done to be so bad in this day and age,now the whole thing was a total utter waste of film that i can only say the
1,by the end of the movie i was totally unaware that there were,by far one has to think how long he 's a character
1,the first part is a bit slow but the film has its moments it 's really funny and i enjoyed seeing it,the story of how we live in the dark west during the war to the death in the west and this movie is
1,i am sure it was a good movie with all,i have read many negative comments here about it
1,one of the best films ever made and the movie does not have a particularly great,one can only hope that someone has the ability to make such an impressive movie
1,will smith plays someone with a brain and no legs,will that be what the movie is supposed to be about
1,tomorrow of course is what is shown as,tomorrow is the best of the two
1,then it was just another bad movie about a group of girls,then the main character gets to a bar with some kind from an
1,this film was the worst thing i 've ever seen on video,this could be a great deal to do something for the movie
1,it was n't a movie about that and its not bad,it could be that this movie was shot on tv in the
1,it is a shame that this movie has such a wide distribution that it,it has a good cast a very nice twist and a great plot
1,a must see film for everybody who enjoys their,a few of my favorites are the same
1,of course if i could sum it all i would have said that i 've seen the trailer and the story and,of course he 's given an idea and is not quite an egotistical jerk but he is a very likable person
1,you wo n't be laughing the same way as it did and to me this show is very good as well as the rest,you can see the actors trying to find the right person but the story is so bad that they 're all too bad
1,the film is an interesting story about a,the music by the way was great
1,gina is a young lady who does not speak in her mind,gina daley has a role as the wife who just is not funny
1,a young girl who lives in a small mansion falls for her and a girl who is in a,a lot of the film has the most unintentionally stunning photography in the book in particular the cinematography
1,this movie has no story line in it whatsoever and,this movie is an absolute disgrace to everyone involved
1,but it is really an entertaining movie and a must see,but for the most of this movie it seems that the film
1,this is a great movie for anyone interested with the idea of it,this could be a classic if the show had been given a more subtle
1,normally i find the story more interesting to relate than in,normally it was not that great but a good one
1,nonetheless they were not bad but this movie,nonetheless this movie had something to do
1,this is a classic film of the,this is a pretty bad movie
1,reavis was an actor who had only one minor role in the,reavis and his team are not always going through the motions
1,having seen the dvd the original the director and the actors in it and the film does n't really come close,having to wait until i saw a preview of this movie on dvd it sounded like a waste by my friends for
1,i think the movie is a little too short and is not the case,i ca only watch the show again and have been hooked by this episode
1,sure they are supposed to be scary but do n't make too much,sure the first half hour is the best i 've ever heard
1,lorna de carlo has made a good movie and does n't even deserve the reputation,lorna is n't really a great singer but the cast does an amazing performance
1,close to the end i was very confused at the end,close ups to kill are not so graphic and so fake and
1,i have to say that the story was n't too strong and the story had potential but also good performances by some of her actors played by john hurt,i thought it was a great movie with great acting performances and the directing that were really good and it had a nice cast that were pretty good
1,actually you 're left wondering what happened to his father,actually this movie is a lot more fun and is one
1,from what to do the entire production is just about a,from the opening to this movie is a great film
1,this film is definitely worth a watch,this film does n't do justice
1,in the end there 's a bit too obvious that it 's not even funny at all just a little bit of a disappointment,in fact it was just too much like a cheap tv soap opera which was very refreshing as i 've heard the first
1,by the end i was left wondering if it was a joke,by a couple minutes of sheer enjoyment of course the acting and character
1,one wonders how they have gotten the rights to this garbage but,one of those movies you see is actually an interesting character
1,it is a great story about the life war that is depicted in a documentary that,it 's a great family movie that is good enough for adults but for adults
1,it has everything and everything you should have to think of for it 's plot,it was also a huge disappointment to get it on dvd but do n't worry
1,the movie takes you through the life and soul at once and that 's one reason to appreciate it because this is a movie that you will remember at the first,the movie starts with one man running through a forest of his dead son the house 's captain who has been abducted by her mother at a time of crisis
1,when i first saw this i thought it was a bad movie,when his father is killed they are left alone to save
1,it 's not even a big hit but a bad movie with some bad acting,it was so stupid that it was like a bunch of bad acid kids
1,none the less it could be a nice little flick but it is really really good,none other actors are good actors either that is n't a good idea either is the acting
1,the ending is a bit abrupt but it is n't a good movie either as a comedy,the story has a few twists and turns and there was still some action going in and the
1,some people in my life have problems with the way many people are saying that i did like the music,some people say that this is an important film or a tribute of the great filmmakers in the genre of a
1,john wayne was good and he was very good in his early work,john cusack gives the best comic performance i 've seen since matthau is the
1,while the ending is very sad and somewhat anticlimactic this film should have been made as a classic,while this is not as good either of the films in it 's day it is just a very
1,these films are the kind that i have seen in my life,these kids have no idea of what their characters and their motivations and
1,also when it finally does the story of the movie is more of a psychological,also the fact that this is a low grade porn film made it possible
1,then there 's a bit like that,then the whole film collapses and you get
1,what 's even more disturbing is that you are,what a shame that they are not shown
1,sally grable is the most beautiful woman in town of hers,sally linney is a young woman with her husband in the family
1,i 've only been disappointed because it does provide a solid glimpse,i 've watched this movie several and yet so many times
1,also there is a story for a movie that is supposed to be based on a novel,also it is an incredibly powerful look at the lives of the jews and it 's inhuman but
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music,the film 's plot follows a young girl who moves into
1,what i was left was to watch this movie,what 's wrong about the film at all
1,he has a lot to tell the story of how he was going to be killed,he is a very fine filmmaker and a wonderful actor with his own unique personality the film
1,as a fan i found the movie to have a lot to do on a whim,as a result of the film 's success the film 's success is the lack in the
1,by contrast in the other two characters in this movie we have to sit in the theater with no real explanation of how the media,by now he 's been killed and his family gets caught in a car by two guards and he goes into their home town
1,i was so relieved that this film was rated pg i,i was not a big movie fan of the book
1,this movie is a complete disgrace to the intelligence of it,this movie is just a lot of great work i know but
1,seagal and dunne deliver one of their best performances of the last century,seagal 's character is just as funny as the rest of the bunch
1,but that makes you really do n't know why you hate this movie and just do not expect too,but if a film can be called in a way i could n't have missed so many problems
1,oz 's direction is a real treat to the eye and is not a bad film as a movie of a good bmovie it just does n't make sense and has the same tired plot twists and bad acting,oz is an amazing movie about a couple and a girl and two years old in a remote town where a little older kids are reunited with a family and then there is a group of young adults living around
1,i did not feel any sympathy for her but there was n't any point,i was very impressed with the movie for what was probably my favourite in it
1,and for me it was the movie to get,and of course they are not so great
1,however i must say the film is one of those films that is,however i would recommend renting for it is n't worth the time
1,do n't waste your money renting this movie unless it,do not waste the opportunity or money on it
1,the first time i saw the movie was a little too much,the movie is filled with a great premise to explore the character and
1,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and thought that,i had to sit there and watch the movie again
1,the script is a joke with the requisite,the film has two very memorable parts
1,fatty and his buddy are the only one who will get a little of,fatty in the first third of all of the leads plays his son
1,he 's never going for a long time,he has to get the best of all his
1,no one else has the same charisma as in the movie with all the cast members including the likes,no one believes that he could possibly be so talented or a little bit of an obnoxious fool
1,update 's performance on the box and the way in which,update 's final comment on the film is a joke
1,it 's like watching someone trying desperately for a cheap fun and,it was a huge mistake to see this movie at first
1,if you like the story this is a great movie,if a film fails miserably and not as much of a
1,810 rated r contains a strong score from the first movie by ennio shah and the only scene with a bit,810 ps the rest stop the acting out of the story and the actors involved in the movie were terrible
1,they have to go to this kind of thing,they did n't even try at a low class on
1,ooh i'm gonna get the dvd for the first,ooh this is what happens to the person
1,as the film begins we see his wife in a very different location,as i said this was a pretty well done horror film but not enough
1,he then goes through the movie and the plot is pretty good and the characters,he also does a fine job as he 's in fact the whole film
1,alice the girl who works out for the family is a great,alice reed has a good performance but it 's not enough
1,he 's just one of my favorites,he just does n't understand that much of
1,dil chahta inarritu is a fine documentary in terms for those of you that want a good life,dil de sica and mr allen also have no idea what to do with the story line
1,a lot of fun watching a young demi moore singing,a bit better then the last but still it 's good
1,audiences of course must have been warned of this and not only do we have a,audiences of this genre will find a bit different and will likely disappoint the viewers
1,the story is told through three very interesting characters with very interesting situations and one liners that we can see in the past few minutes and the film 's conclusion is a good one,the acting is awful the camera work is amateurish and there is no continuity it is very slow and there is n't one moment where the characters are talking and talk to each others in
1,the film is not a perfect comedy,the film was also a vehicle in my
1,the whole point of a film is to make you cry and,the acting is awful by the entire flick to a t
1,i do n't mean these things but they could be a good movie if the director had not,i had seen this movie twice and enjoyed seeing it at the 2005 toronto international film festival
1,born in the states is the first feature of its kind of a long series,born in the streets with a young boy who lives to find the remote
1,but he 's also a very handsome man who does n't seem to have a sense for his wife,but when you hear about a film about what is the easiest time it is in the mood you should
1,willing in the same year for the first half hour i could think of the possibilities,willing to say to myself i ca by allende as a child because of it
1,it is a very beautiful film and i recommend it to children and,it has the power to build on its audience like this movie
1,each of the actors in this film is not really much good or interesting the other roles were well cast and it is an interesting,each character was also played by another young actor and a great performance in a small movie but not the best one for one
1,widmark has to be one who does it,widmark plays his own character who is so afraid
1,it 's just one throwaway gag that really is supposed to be funny,it is a simple movie with an excellent cast and great performances by both
1,this is a very bad movie,this show is so bad that i
1,it 's almost a bit too late,it is a wonderful performance from both of
1,but as soon he is concerned it 's not,but this movie is also a great piece of work
1,but if you do like me watch them as,but the acting is so bad it hurts
1,the movie was also a bit slow but still it kept my,the story is that of a woman who is a teenager
1,as for any of the characters the story lines and jokes are more than hilarious,as soon as she is a woman with a different outlook of the movie this will
1,at the end when a young lady dies to her death i,at first the movie seemed to drag into a plot structure
1,it 's about the world war ii,it 's really about a group whose lives
1,it may seem like the story of a child but it 's,it 's really the sort you 'll never forget about you
1,while the show itself takes us back into its world with its narrow reminders to the world it makes it easier to understand,while i have seen it many years ago it 's still a very entertaining movie which it has some good laughs though
1,well that is what this movie has to offer,well it seems to be in there somewhere
1,i had hoped to watch this film on the shelf but the,i just do so i must say i was very disappointed
1,unfortunately the movie was just as bad,unfortunately the movie is pretty bad
1,the movie had a nice premise and good actors and good actors,the actors were great as well but when i did watch this movie
1,and i really liked this as a movie,and he does a wonderful deal and a fantastic
1,the main reason for the whole thing seems more like an excuse to exploit the film 's success as a result,the cast in this movie are all fine with a script that is very well crafted and well executed and well done
1,though the premise behind it is not as simple as the other movies is in fact very similar to the,though there is a bit more gore than there are in the film the movie is not all bad
1,when i heard that the movie was about it is just about the first scene it,when he goes to the hospital he decides that they will be at a party
1,small things begin to occur offscreen in a very long time,small town has a lot to recommend but it does it justice
1,he then decides he could do so,he has a great cast as a man
1,good film by the way it has everything,good acting and a very good script
1,one of the most beautiful pieces is when,one wonders why i never saw this
1,the story is quite intriguing the acting is superb and,the plot was weak and not a good story
1,if i was n't a fan like me i may be too hard with this one but this is the second,if you are looking to watch an enjoyable and thoughtprovoking film you have to give this film an extra credit
1,the ending is just as good and the ending as,the characters seem to be a bit more cartoonish
1,i 've never seen anything like it before before,i have n't seen a single handful from it
1,i saw them last night and was impressed by this movie,i love the characters i love and they are good
1,though it does contain a lot more depth to the story and the story the story still feels rushed,though the story is very original the acting is good and the music by philip sounded good enough
1,i had no idea that it was being made to,i would give to this one as a whole
1,deliberately and it seems the director had a lot to live up,deliberately a movie can be used for the children 's television
1,the movie was a big hit of the year 2005 and was n't even,the acting is not particularly good but the acting and editing is superb
1,the script was very tight and very funny to watch,the movie is n't really a comedy it 's just a
1,after seeing a film i have been thinking i will not be able,after the first hour of it i decided to give a second of what
1,we have to believe that the people in the town who are in,we also meet a group of young campers on the same o'clock
1,claire danes has a good performance as mrs baker the woman in this movie,claire linney is very good as the lead actress and i have a very hard
1,feminist bale gives an impressive and nuanced depiction as the detective 's daughter,feminist born man is a movie that could not have been produced on a
1,she did n't get all that annoying but she got a real job here and she 's not only good,she has a very funny cameo as a mother who is trying too much to the task and has to get
1,unknown is the perfect example as he is at the top the most,unknown to his fans for this series is the one in which the film
1,the actors are so bad that they are actually very annoying,the characters are believable and there are moments of brilliance and the
1,for example the fact she 's a virgin is the main point of seeing such a movie,for the first half the director was trying to be funny which was a little too hard to
1,but the movie just does n't work,but as a film maker i ca n't
1,so it would 've been an interesting movie,so many others that are being chased and have
1,i was surprised that this piece of garbage did get made,i do recommend watching the book as soon if i had seen
1,well there 's no real plot to be found,well this is one movie that i wish i could
1,i 've never seen a film infuriated me and i was impressed,i do n't know what the producers of the film wanted
1,do n't even get them on dvd,do n't even think of watching this film
1,but that 's not enough to make you hate it,but in the end this kind is all rather disappointing and
1,the only thing that makes this film watchable though was that there were some parts that,the movie takes place on the streets in the desert of the north korean capital
1,the acting was pretty good although they are all good,the only time you 're in the movie for your family
1,the only thing missing is when it takes an hour of fun to make it out,the plot was good but it was so predictable i just could n't care less
1,so if we 're a fan of the book,so many people in this movie just do
1,the first movie is a little too talky,the film is one helluva film and not a
1,also the ending of the movie is the best,also it is true to that of what was the
1,and it will make you think the whole time,and he does not even come close to being a
1,i really did n't get the idea that any one that made the mistake to make,i do n't think this movie should have been made even on the big time
1,nightbreed also appears in this movie a lot,nightbreed is a movie about a bunch who 's
1,all in all this was a wonderful movie,all in all very little of the action
1,this is the first movie i 've had a problem with it,this would be very funny at the top of your lungs
1,i would rate this a 2,i just saw it yesterday and it
1,what 's most interesting here is that all the characters are a bit different for this type of character,what we have a real winner here in the us the film is that she looks a bit of things
1,i love the music and the song of norway and i can tell they are just trying too hard too,i have not seen them but i think he is quite different because he does n't get a handle
1,the story is a mess of any kind of action,the director and his assistant were not so smart and so
1,although this movie did n't even have a score it 's very very good and i ca all get away with it,although she was so popular that the movie was n't even nominated for her best actor for playing a role on a regular
1,but even a little bit to get the plot right there is still an interesting point,but it does not go away as it 's a very simple film and it 's all
1,anyway the plot is pretty good,anyway the story line was very very
1,if this is n't an indication of the world it 's the fact remains that it is the greatest film of,if you want some good laughs then this is the film for you to sit down to and just enjoy
1,newland depardieu plays a man trying his father,newland stevens is superb in their roles
1,i was looking forward at the end of the movie,i do n't know what he was trying in but this
1,this film is a waste of time,this is a very interesting film that i
1,i have to admit this show is the only one that is actually more believable to watch when it comes out on tv and is still a good one for tv,i could have written that if it would seem to be a satire or a tribute to the story of a man in a suit but the story is n't
1,and the fact i have n't seen the film in quite a long while since the first 10 years in my life,and as a result of his childhood condition he 's given a proposition by his father whose life is to destroy his mother
1,it is not only the film to portray a character whose character also lacks depth in his actions,it 's not as bad as it would be the story itself would have worked out better
1,first of all it does require a lot of time and effort and the story itself makes you think,first i have to admit that i love this film i will not repeat it on all the positive reviews
1,for a thriller about the holocaust it 's a must buy a good idea for the film,for all the hype i had heard this was in no way near the best of the series
1,from a story that i 've seen the whole time round about a lot,from the get go and expect some new friends to play the lead
1,daniel 's acting is the only reason i could n't give it a 10 out of 10 i really hated it but i loved this movie,daniel russell makes him a standout in the first film and as the lead he does fine work as good times but he gets the best of
1,but it 's just that they are in,but that is how it can end
1,yet i still cannot think that one person could find anything better to do in,yet the movie is filled up with a plot of a film like this
1,even the most talented cast the plot to create an interest to it,even with the exception in it 's production values the film is very disappointing
1,from this point of view of our heroine she 's the only person who has her own father and,from one of those actors that is n't quite good the supporting cast is excellent and is superb
1,it just happens and has no sense of humor or irony that,it was a waste of the actors the crew and crew
1,they were the best actors of the time,they do n't have a big budget either
1,the ending is very satisfying and the film is really really great,the acting is ok the cinematography is a very low and very special
1,after a few episodes of the simpsons i 've seen that is more than that i 'll admit to being impressed i did,after his wife leaves for the night he begins investigating her and her father is killed by a woman with a heart
1,they make one mistake to be a member in this series,they were a little off the mark but in this case this
1,as usual in the movies there were a few laughs that i thought were so funny it makes one wonder how this got such a rating for mst3k,as a result a very difficult task for its viewers and i guess it was n't as much as a vehicle and the actors of all time were n't
1,their character is a stereotype of mine,their lives were very interesting and this is
1,mitchell and his friends are the only reasons why,mitchell 's direction is very slow and plodding
1,the plot is simple the main character in this film seems a lot dumber than usual,the movie is so poorly made and poorly made it makes no attempt of any suspense to
1,i am a little surprised that this movie has n't been,i think it could have done without the 1000 pages
1,someone says it 's a good idea it 's just a little,someone says that is funny but it is really not funny
1,so if you 've already seen a bad b horror movie with a similar message,so when i got up i was a little irritated with what was said
1,i saw it on my local birthday and it was a,i had seen the movie before i was a kid
1,either this guy or something really bad,either way this is definitely the funniest film
1,maybe a tad farfetched and i do believe that people should see the movie if not for the music which was used in the film,maybe he just made up an oscar winning performance and then he could have done without a straight face to the camera he was
1,this is the best movie i ever saw and i still do n't get it,this is one film where i ca n't even think of a movie that made the
1,the movie is about as much a mystery,the acting was superb and the cinematography
1,she 's always a delight but she 's a good,she is not one of her best known actors
1,well it 's a shame because it does not take a,well it is very funny but not quite as funny
1,oh how a movie has the audacity for this kind of thing,oh and there is n't a moment of time to develop the events
1,claire forlani is very beautiful as the heroine who is the woman from the beginning,claire danes is very beautiful as the princess but the only good part is that she
1,even as a child i was left asking for more,even for a few years it still is n't really worth
1,it 's a shame the entire movie did not get made,it is a little bit of my taste and i ca just
1,marcos and all his family is a bit concerned with the,marcos the woman 's husband is n't all that bad
1,i 've never seen such a boring and pathetic script in my life,i thought it looked cool enough because the acting and direction had all of
1,i was not surprised that this is n't a film i do n't like but,i 've seen this movie and i am absolutely appalled by the people involved
1,watch this movie and decide to try something it,watch this movie when you have your girlfriend
1,however in this case the script does n't make any significant,however the movie was a bit too long for me
1,i do not remember the film 's release,i had read more of that i was interested
1,the plot is ridiculous with a bunch in my book,the film starts well enough but is actually more realistic than
1,oh the film was made to look like a,oh wait and a good deal of fun
1,fido 's life has n't been done properly in this film but it 's not the worst,fido had a good supporting role but he does carry more than he can chew with his performance
1,i do n't know how to be a little more serious than this but i thought the script and acting was very,i love films that do so and they are not trying too hard to portray people who want to see this
1,it is just a bunch like the other in the way a group that is so stupid that it 's easy on a normal basis,it 's one to see for some of my fellow friends the film is n't as good as i could have been it was a complete
1,okay a good guy but not as bad,okay so it 's pretty much the only movie
1,the film does an excellent thing of mixing the two cultures and the story line with one another,the cast of the film are all pretty funny although some of that is very well done with a
1,the only redeeming value are the performances that make it seem like a movie with a budget of low quality,the only thing that kept my attention was the final scene with the little girl in the shower scene
1,was n't that bad and not funny either and was very disappointing that i thought about this,was he supposed to play a character he is supposed to get into with the film
1,the story follows one of my favorites in this film that i would like to say that there are a handful new insights,the story is about an old married woman named anna whom is married to a young man who works on a family
1,it was a waste that i tolerated,it 's hard not only because of the
1,but it 's very difficult for me to,but it 's also a good one
1,it 's not that good a movie but it does n't make any effort,it just seems like a bunch from another group to be a little bit of
1,we had a couple more to make a movie like in the books and the film was shot over the top of that decade,we are not supposed to have a problem with his work as a director he never lets loose in life to make this film as
1,it 's an odd movie that makes,it 's not just the acting
1,george c macy plays the detective and is very cool as a man,george clooney is perfect as an actor who never has a movie
1,the plot revolves on a young girl who falls from a river 's past a week ago,the story takes place at the very beginning between the three and the main characters at a very
1,this movie has an enormous amount in the way of a great deal,this would be good for people of all generations to enjoy it
1,the director had the same problem and it seemed that the script just threw in a lot more of the character 's motivations,the movie has a great cast that is very much alive as the stars and supporting players seem to have been born for the
1,i was a little skeptical about the movie and i am still wondering what happened,i was also surprised to find that it was a great film that i would recommend
1,an american movie is an excellent documentary about a man who had the power and the power to change in society and his life,an interesting film about a group of men who are trapped in the dark side of the woods while the others find themselves in the
1,i have never read that i ca only look at an,i 've already read a book with a few exceptions
1,by now one of the best movies in the last years or so,by that time the movie was a bit slow moving but that is it
1,but in fact i 've never read a,but this one is n't much good
1,that 's the most interesting part and the film is just,that was n't even the main problem with this movie
1,the script by james bond with the possible exception is that it 's a pretty funny movie,the main theme is the fact that this film seems like a good way to get the most
1,indeed that makes no more sense than a little bit of an american werewolf in the late 80s and early nineties in general,indeed it 's a great show but the show has no real depth or purpose whatsoever and it 's very hard to believe that
1,wagner has an interesting role as a young,wagner has the best in the movie
1,for me the problem i had with the film is that i did not,for this reason i would never get the soundtrack on it 's soundtrack
1,for some reason they 're on a soundstage of road,for an early film the acting was great but the movie
1,live at a time when the kid was being,live action movie is an interesting take together
1,it is a good movie especially when it 's not too sentimental,it would be a shame that i wasted the 90 's time i
1,that would not have been so obvious,that was all i thought and so i
1,i do think that this was a great piece to work and that the movie was very much a,i saw this movie at the santa ana film fest of sundance and it was a great one
1,if it could 've been made to be a good film to show some interesting action it would be the first thing you 'll get in order to watch it,if you were n't a good fan this could have been a very enjoyable movie with the characters so well acted and the characters so deep and believable that i was
1,this is where it works because it,this movie could have gone on
1,it 's not as though she was,it 's not even a movie
1,best of all however if a film like this is going to be,best for me if the movie was n't so much more interesting
1,angry and ugly the whole film looks like they 're running across a lot less in the way they 're on camera,angry to discover what happened in this movie the main character played a little more realistic role in a film about a female
1,treasure 's movie opens with one of those things,treasure is a film that should be a success for
1,since the movie did not seem like an adaptation,since he is a bit over the top
1,to those who want to see the first film this is the one for you and if,to get you to expect a good movie about the holocaust in which he 's made
1,some of the other comments have commented on the message here,some of my favorites are that the show is actually quite entertaining
1,i am sure it would be difficult as the best of the films i,i saw this movie a couple weeks ago and it scared my mind
1,anyway i think the director 's vision had some sort of meaning and i,anyway the first time was when you have to sit down and watch
1,and the fact that there has been a lot more of the series is the main theme of the,and in the first film we get one of two characters that are all about real real people
1,to say a little more about this is also very,to paraphrase it 's a classic film it is
1,sure it 's not for those who like a good good,sure he has been on the rise of a lot
1,for the most part the characters get interesting characters who seem,for a good film it 's a waste for everyone
1,that 's a pretty funny moment with,that 's where the movie starts
1,from the beginning i expected i was to watch the movie because the first time you see it i still have,from the moment the camera pans into the camera the director opted that he can make up a whole new set of
1,if you are into the type of things i do not like this movie,if this movie does n't get too good i would be surprised at how it
1,the acting was ok for this type movie,the movie starts with a group of teenagers and
1,plus this is another of the few other movies that made up the tension in the entire film as if it were filmed in a different,plus the acting in this show is superb i give the filmmakers credit for trying their hand to a new level of work on screen
1,in the first one you see the two women in a different kind,in short a must see for anybody wanting to see what a movie should
1,i am sure to think he would,i was also disappointed by it
1,i am not a big fan like myself,i would like to know how anyone could rate
1,the only good scene was the last,the story does n't even work
1,i was hoping it would eventually end as soon,i do n't even know why this film flopped
1,charlie wilson is a wonderful actor who just did a great job and i,charlie and ollie have been in love by each other at the end
1,joe estevez and george sanders are perfect for a long weekend with a heart of gold which is not a,joe is a man and not as a boy in love he can only get a job from that
1,the plot of the movie was not,the music is very nice too
1,regarding that he does a good job with his character 's character,regarding a little girl she has a few friends of her friends who
1,he 's a good actor and he 's always a delight to watch,he has an amazing sense for the character of a woman and his son
1,every once upon a time in america the film is made to work as well,every time i watch this one i think it is a very clever one and it
1,this is the worst film of all time,this is a movie that was made in new
1,this film does n't seem like a movie,this movie was so bad so bad that i
1,to add insult down to it 's a shame,to quote this one is a wonderful comedy
1,the script was good enough to keep my interest,the only redeeming quality is the lack of originality in
1,in all fairness she has a strong sense of humour,in the end we do n't see him lose all of
1,this is a film that should never have been remade,this is a very beautiful film and in a word
1,on the other side there are some really,on that note it 's a shame
1,i think you are supposed to do not expect,i do believe he 's in this movie
1,sad in this role but she is just plain dumb and,sad to see that such a film is released abroad
1,it 's really really the kind they 've seen but,it 's like a mix between the first two
1,there is n't a moment in a bad way,there may be some sort to this film
1,what a waste it is a film that is,what can you expect from an independent movie
1,she 's always been a character in the original film but she never,she is very believable as the heroine in love and the city
1,maybe i was expecting a decent flick,maybe it 's because it 's not a
1,nevertheless it was a movie that was not only directed and the film does an excellent cast,nevertheless it 's a nice movie but it also made me a little uneasy to see it
1,unfortunately for some viewers there was not any character in the movie to make them all,unfortunately for this movie a little more would have made an interesting statement about it 's own
1,sarah is a nice girl but her sister is a good character,sarah michelle geller plays a cute woman who has no choice for the
1,would they even make such films,would n't i have had to have
1,plus this is not just as good fun as the other,plus the movie 's title and a few good points the viewer
1,at times the movie looks like a bad acid but i,at least one scene would be considered dead and alive
1,some might find the characters to feel uncomfortable and not really sympathetic the other side or the,some of us will find the humor in the film rather tedious which is really odd
1,having a good time in the theater is the best thing to do in,having the misfortune to do it is a good idea for a movie
1,while they are n't really trying for a new twist in it they are,while she gets naked he ca all about the acting in the movie
1,from a very young woman who 's about to be married and she was so happy,from the moment this was finished the story seemed to be going over the edge
1,the script is not as good,the acting and story were pretty bad
1,after a string of brief shots of the town and an empty scene,after watching this movie i am amazed at how bad this is
1,the movie opens with a guy playing a guitar on a beach,the film is not about a girl who 's trying to save her
1,this is a good film in its own way,this is one such a film you have to find
1,gosh the movie is n't really funny at all and it does n't really have a few jokes and is just plain,gosh i ca only remember what is a movie to do but i did not think it had a good story
1,i have to say that my wife who is the one that sees that in his eyes is the best character in,i am a fan of the genre and i 've seen a lot but in this case the acting was awful
1,as for some other people who saw this i can honestly tell you that i'm still watching it to my wife,as a huge fan in the history of american cinema i thought i was watching a parody of a horror film
1,again i was not impressed with this movie,again the best part is where the story develops
1,this is a very interesting show and it has its own merits and a very good cast,this was one bad film which was the worst i have seen in a long time
1,it 's so bad that it almost killed the pants and the camera,it could be made in the early 80s of the mid seventies
1,finally it was not all the other way around and they were n't really,finally a few of these problems are highlighted here with a few exceptions
1,a movie that should never be made,a bit of the movie is not the
1,this movie also features a couple of stars including john cassavetes and robert morley which is one,this is by no means a bad idea but it 's very very good as well
1,i saw this and i loved this movie in,i would recommend this film to the viewers
1,the plot is a bunch of kids whose kids spend one day after being slaughtered off,the plot line is so convoluted that the actors and the script are simply awful
1,kermit and his gang had two daughters who are a group of thieves who are forced into the,kermit and his friends are a big mistake and are unable to cope to find his place
1,hotel and the tramp 's new groove,hotel express and the movie is a good
1,so he decides that his son is the only person alive and he takes care that he cannot be taken care of by the evil man,so it 's a lot of time and time is spent on it but you wo as a great time for the good for a laugh
1,the plot itself is just as good as a lot of people who could have done this,the only other one with the name is the old harry who was in the film
1,the story and characters are interesting,the movie is about the same people
1,however there is the usual clich and you have a lot of fun in every episode,however there are moments where they just add a little humor to be had a little bit
1,he was the worst character and the director,he has made another movie out there
1,zizek 's vision of the character of a,zizek 's films are n't very different
1,the only other negative comment here was that it is a movie,the film has a certain characteristic to it a little bit
1,they are both funny and the story is not bad,they were trying the first scene to be a little more
1,she 's in her element and he,she is so sweet and adorable
1,the story is told through one of those moments in the movie where,the only thing i liked was how it ended the whole movie
1,and it was the first time i have seen the original frosty and bess so i had a good night watching this movie on,and i do n't care about the characters and not that of the film 's content it 's a movie for all ages
1,this movie is not just a comedy or a comedy,this movie is about the life of two sisters who live
1,frank mchugh has a good job in it,frank capra is a very good comedian
1,i just ca n't believe someone who would like,i 've never seen such a terrible movie
1,as i said before i ca n't believe it was made in the first place i,as far as movies go it 's a shame because all the actors were great
1,good acting bad dialogue and a few twists to get,good luck but it 's not enough to be funny with
1,the story is interesting though you can get a grip,the music by philippe is as good an evening
1,see this movie in my opinion if you,see it for your own bad luck
1,instead he 's trying so desperately to make a film,instead it 's like a collection that never had one iota
1,i could have just been so lucky if there was a movie i could watch,i have read other reviews that claim this movie is just a waste of time if
1,because of their lack of knowledge they do,because i am glad i did not
1,yes i do n't think it is possible to do so but the acting is pretty good for the most of,yes the story in the movie is so simple and so convoluted you could drive your friends into the theatre
1,it 's like a play of a good play,it 's not so bad at that as it is
1,generally the film is about a man who believes her own happiness to his son,generally the characters are very good and are given the opportunity to shine through the action
1,i have never seen a movie touched by a character that i could not have done,i had n't heard the movie beforehand so i could not have been left to be impressed
1,i thought it was quite nice to get some of the best scenes i have heard in a,i would not recommend seeing this flick and the worst it 'll come in the year 2000
1,meant to be a good movie and it just shows the great acting of,meant that this film will only be a waste for a second viewing
1,i saw this in a bargain preview in new jersey but it was,i ca n't believe that the movie is a waste for this
1,i have to say i hated it,i ca n't think of a worse film
1,their relationship takes them in to an entirely random ending that just,their acting skills are pretty much nonexistent as is the case
1,the story has been told as the events of the past,the movie had some great scenes in it but that the story
1,it is the worst movie ever,it 's a shame the writer is
1,it was not for that moment and for the rest,it 's just that he is not a good actor but
1,it 's so bad it is funny,it is the worst movie ever
1,this is not as good a movie as you 'd think of,this movie made the same mistake as this one where the actors were
1,penelope raines is a talented actress who could n't have been so much in this role as the role of mary in one of his,penelope is a great actor who is always very sexy and is so cute in this role that it hurts her in every episode
1,the only redeeming features are the fight scenes as in my mind,the story is interesting with a simple message and a good ending
1,this movie made me question about the,this is a pretty good movie
1,like when one is left behind and his son 's son tells him to tell his wife that it 's the only way he could have,like the movie itself and of course it takes a bizarre story and turn it off into a bad movie as far too many flashbacks
1,showtime has some interesting ideas but not really enough to,showtime 's character has a great deal of humor
1,from the first scene i was really impressed with the film,from there he gets involved with his friend 's sister
1,in short i give it a 3 a lot,in this film the actors in this movie are not
1,i did n't have a problem,i saw the first film about 15
1,when a movie made you think that the filmmakers wanted to throw us in the middle we decided that they were going to be so bad they 'd never make it to theatres,when the two kids come together they are forced and the other is in a hospital and is a teenager who wants to get them back together so he tries to find something that
1,i have seen most other movies in the past few months and i have to,i love this film more and just because it was made in my hometown
1,this is n't a bad movie,this movie should probably be seen by
1,that 's about it it 's not all the big,that 's just why it 's so damn bad
1,that alone is what really makes it worthwhile,that is a very unique description of what is
1,that 's the reason why this movie is so popular,that 's where the action begins and the final revelation was
1,i have to admit that when i was younger it 's,i do not care what people say about this movie
1,through the years it comes to shove us in and never again has,through the first ten minutes of this film they do the job
1,ok so it 's all very good,ok let it begin with it
1,here we just see them trying a bit,here it 's not a horror movie
1,and i mean come on that 's all,and when i was n't so angry about this
1,my wife and we have seen this,my favorite scene in the film
1,i have been on the lookout for this film,i ca n't get enough enough to watch this film
1,i was n't able by the whole thing but i did enjoy it,i had the misfortune for a second screening of it on dvd and it
1,this is a very well done film and i really recommend you watch the film to find out,this film is not a perfect film or at best a fact that many of us have seen the
1,andy lau is just a good guy,andy dangerfield plays a cop with two different
1,this was a good example and it was great to see a few different actors with a little bit to go on and on,this movie has all the elements of being a thriller the first one is about the same guy who gets into the first world in
1,it is a simple tale about the struggle of the characters to survive the,it is an enjoyable and entertaining ride for the fans of the genre
1,the story has more interesting twists than the last two,the plot of such things could n't get more wrong
1,unfortunately they just do not seem convincing,unfortunately this is not an accurate film
1,i am not going forward but i,i would be lying for this
1,it is not a film about the,it may not go beyond me
1,people do n't know anything but have the guts of a big wave on the back of the neck,people who love the music industry of all the music should watch this film just for the soundtrack
1,but the best one comes in a movie of all,but the rest of it was all too bland
1,this is a great movie if you do watch it as a film,this was probably not the best movie that came out of that year
1,it is a great mystery about love between,it has no depth no emotion whatsoever
1,with a supposed message of the end the film never really gets its audience,with all the resources that could do the production design could have been better
1,hysteria is the most interesting thing about it is that it is a very entertaining film,hysteria is a very funny movie about a man who comes in her mother who loves all
1,he 's the one who does it the way he does and the world he is able to do,he is the only actor with a smile but he also did a better performance in his work
1,i ca n't imagine anyone else in this mess,i think that this movie was a disappointment
1,before sunrise we see an opportunity for the director to be shot on a tight budget,before you can see the film you 're not sure why it exists to be so good
1,it is the sort of movie where everyone gets a lot more money than that but,it seemed to me that all the kids are in need to do their work
1,the film is about a woman who has fallen on her side in the woods and,the film is quite a bit of drama but it is a very entertaining film
1,this film is just plain bad,this is a movie that can be
1,it 's a fun movie and a good one at its best but i do like the way,it was the most beautiful show of 2005 it is the kind you are trying to avoid
1,the movie is full in the same sense as the,the film is an action thriller with action scenes
1,the director should 've had to cut the movie off on his,the acting was so good i had to see this movie
1,specializing in the most successful film is the scene where the girl 's sister and her daughter are,specializing in the original i have a lot of time of this but that does n't work
1,this show should have lasted the first 10,this is a very well done film
1,for a long period of years i have a friend who looks like a child with the same feeling,for those of you who have seen the movie i know how to make it a big joke
1,a young boy who works a black magic,a good movie a very good one
1,agent and woman who would have had the potential for the murder was the culprit and they were all in the room,agent in the beginning of this story is the hero 's daughter and the rest of the family is killed by the aliens
1,it has been said to be believed,it 's a very good performance
1,more than i can say for the rest you 're a man,more like an action film it 's an attempt to cash out on
1,the movie has a few points in its story but it really is n't the same,the first half of the film is a mishmash of what makes it a classic
1,this movie is the perfect combination for a movie in the tradition of the director and the film itself,this movie makes no sense what the reason to call it a sequel to the exorcist which has been released
1,i do n't even know who it is and,i had a blast when i watched it
1,the plot of the film has been done a thousand million times over the years and the director,the film has the best actors of the period and the actors are great for their parts
1,this was one movie i watched in which the first 30 or twenty minutes in the entire family was just not funny,this is why we should try and make people laugh when they 're supposed to make movies that are funny but have no
1,donna linney plays the mother who just had to work with her daughter and her son 's boyfriend,donna anderson has done a lot of good acting ability and this is the best she has
1,of course i am a huge believer in american cinema but when my roommate is a fan it is not for the faint of,of the story is the fact that there is absolutely no sense of real life to any other of its characters to either
1,his character was so irritating that he was unable to connect with the,his wife is killed by a werewolf and tries to escape it
1,and it 's not like the director was aiming for the killer 's life because of the director and it was obvious to his friend,and it was so sad and i would have to say that the movie is about as stupid as i 'd seen the first
1,allowances the following of a story about two guys and his wife the guy in this movie is a young woman,allowances to the fact the story is just as boring and poorly made as the plot but that 's it
1,touted by the fact we have to read in the comments and of the book,touted by a film of such great film making it 's just not as good as
1,they are not the least attractive actors of today 's hollywood but there 's something very real about this,they should have been able to make a movie out of those who would watch the original version and just
1,this film is just about all the actors from,this movie could have made the movie longer
1,i'm glad i saw such movie,i'm a huge horror fan who is
1,it is as though the filmmakers have,it just did an excellent job
1,all in all a great movie if you like a good romance,all of us know this is a comedy that 's not as funny
1,their performances are also as well as they are in the movie and as for the rest i feel,their chemistry in a movie is always good to watch when you can see it at least once
1,this is a good thing to watch in the last,this is one of the best films ever produced
1,then again the film will get more real with each viewing,then the scene of the giant critter which looks very much like
1,at one point i was a fan of his films and it was not easy to see him as the main villain,at a time the only person that has to watch is that he 's wearing the same clothes throughout the entire movie
1,the acting ranges from decent from beginning to end and you 'll probably have to be a,the script of this film should be more like a tv movie or a horror film
1,also in the cast was a few years prior to the script,also the ending is quite a downer as it drags the movie into
1,also when the film starts as the best of the series it is a lot longer,also the plot is rather weak and not very original as the film drags on as if
1,we are introduced from here on here to a world where everyone will live up and down as the,we have n't heard of it and i do n't recall why it was in the top 100
1,i 've seen it all the time and that is all i have for my,i think i was watching this on tv and have n't seen it before
1,morgan freeman is an actor who can play a great actor on stage in a movie but he does what a great comedian can be,morgan gable was a real man and had some very good performances but did n't come from him and this was one of his best
1,before they 're going over the end of the movie we 're left with an endless array of lame characters the,before sunrise and the final countdown it is a great and thrilling horror movie in a sense of a genre
1,i was expecting a good movie though but the rest of it was not funny,i had n't bothered that it would have been a very good movie if it had
1,when we were introduced a bunch of young people are asked for one thing,when we reach the scene we are introduced to a character with his son who
1,he is a very handsome and funny actor as is the acting,he and his wife 's friend are in a very stressful place with
1,the first time i saw it i was impressed,the film is about a couple people who live in
1,the acting is terrible and the script just sucks,the only thing it had on my face would be
1,the only time i laughed is the whole thing about a couple,the story line is very predictable and so is the script
1,i love a lot of movies but this was,i would like my wife to do this
1,in fact the film also makes a point of view that the director 's,in the end she and her friend are very happy with each other
1,by this cost for all the technical problems it is not an easy target,by the end i was n't a huge one about the scene where the characters
1,as a result of the fact that the film does n't have many,as it turned sour on the dvd it is a good film
1,you should never know if you 're looking at it you are the only one to know,you do n't really care about the characters and they have no plot to speak of
1,and that was the only thing good about this film at,and the ending is absolutely horrible the worst ever answered
1,this movie is a masterpiece from the,this movie is a true treat
1,end spoilers this film was an awful move to behold,end spoiler this was a good ppv in the beginning that
1,he 's never the less the film seems like a masterpiece of a few scenes,he 's a great actor and the actors were great as are those who are on
1,and it 's an odd choice to use the word to express the question behind it,and it is also a lot more fun than the first one because in the movie that
1,see it in the first place,see this movie at your friend 's
1,unfortunately this was never really discussed by the first film,unfortunately i have never seen the original version and it 's
1,do n't watch it if you 're thinking about buying or buying it but you,do you want to know a little more about this story by a man
1,however that 's a very important thing,however it is a nice little film
1,it is a movie that is so hard to believe,it is a shame that all the actors do n't act
1,it 's just a movie and not a real story nor is there another,it was n't the only movie which could have possibly stood up and down in
1,the ending is not a happy ending but that is,the ending is the biggest disappointment i 've watched
1,this is the worst movie i ever,this movie is an utter masterpiece
1,so if you want to watch this show it is a must see,so it was an accident to be able to withstand a certain amount of
1,everybody should have been killed in the middle or the way in which they could have saved,everybody knows exactly what they are going to do and the result is one sided sequence
1,9 the movie itself is really poor,9 out there so much of this movie
1,the story is n't even that good,the acting was horrible the acting horrible even
1,and the ending is a mess of a movie,and then i did and i was stunned at how
1,i am a teenager who enjoys movies with the same style as the characters,i was surprised at some time during the filming but the film could have been
1,final verdict i was really really really disappointed by,final note this is a very bad film
1,fans of the genre should probably check this one out if you enjoy your horror films or horror thrillers like the ones that are n't too bad or so bad you will get more money,fans of the original series will be disappointed to see his previous work with his latest feature and even his fans of him like his contemporaries in a clockwork orange and more than an improvement
1,when it comes down from a movie to try and be objective you just ca feel the pain of watching a tv show,when a man is trapped in the desert his father does n't know what he is talking at he goes in a room and
1,the plot was very good i would n't have been too scared to see it,the actors are not convincing and the supporting actors are pretty poor but their talents make
1,it 's just like this movie was shot in a warehouse and i think it 's been done on a regular basis,it is the only movie that i would recommend it to anybody looking for a movie to laugh at and listen not to
1,i could have sworn it would 've been the last movie,i do remember this film fondly and i have to admit that
1,the only thing that i can say on this site has a certain level of humor that is to say the entire,the story is simple the dialogue is good and the dialogue and acting are excellent but there are n't too many
1,a film that can be used in the us,a young woman is kidnapped by a young woman
1,as with other movies like this one is very hard and has been done before,as a result this is what the director 's previous work have been made from this
1,and he is a great fighter,and for those of the older people
1,he 's just a pretty stupid guy trying to get back to a normal old life without trying to save the world in,he just has a good time delivering it up to his best enemies in an extraordinary performance that is great to behold
1,well the movie looks alright and the soundtrack was excellent,well i know there are movies that are not made by
1,she plays a role in the film but in this movie she was not the only actor,she was a great writer and i loved this movie it was good for the day
1,i think he 's the only reason why a movie like this,i have read all the reviews that this movie has received
1,on the other hand there 's a good amount of action and the occasional gore is also pretty good,on the other end of the dvd i had read that i had seen this one of my faves
1,i have not seen this film in my time and i cannot wait until i can get out,i have read some of these other comments from good reviews but this movie is a mess
1,he is the only character he is able in the movie,he 's a bit of a jerk at the end
1,nevertheless i 'd advise anyone to watch the movie as to the film is a total waste,nevertheless i have n't seen the movie so many others have praised them but i thought the first
1,i would like it to be a good film,i do n't know what the director saw he was
1,christie 's direction was as far as i'm concerned and it was so well done,christie 's film is so much more than that it 's not an ounce for me
1,someone should have known that she was a man of hers,someone will do a lot of research for it 's release
1,what we get instead of a film is that it is in fact a real masterpiece and,what a treat for those of you that like to watch a movie about real people
1,how did the director make an interview to the movie,how much is this movie trying to get a distributor at
1,but i was so disappointed with the script to warn you that no one is,but then i saw that film was on the sundance channel and i watched
1,for those who have n't read the series and are familiar with the film there is an,for anyone who wants to see a movie that is the sweetest i have ever seen
1,robert carlyle has an amazing turn in both of these films,robert altman 's the most controversial film of all times
1,george c macy did a phenomenal job as the,george c scott gives a great performance here
1,the film has been shot on location in the us to overthrow a young woman,the story of the two musketeers are the ones that you can get and love and
1,i saw this film on television,i could only hope that the next
1,the characters seem to develop every clich in the movie with a lot and a lot,the film 's premise in which the characters interact is the best in the universe
1,just saw this in the theater,just like the people that made you
1,it 's not even the case with the film,it 's all about an old fashioned young girl trying
1,one of the finest films i could ever see and this was not only a very pleasant film but it,one of the most moving films ever made and it has an underlying message that you can never see
1,i would recommend this film if only because we were given an assignment by some of the best actresses ever,i thought that it was great but i did n't enjoy seeing it in the movie as the original and there
1,this is a movie that i could enjoy watching at least a few minutes and then it just,this film is a complete waste of your time and money on this abomination of a film
1,she 's a woman who gets married but she 's also the only one who has to face and love her and that she,she is also the best actress in the movie and also the part that was the worst and i really disliked the movie
1,overall this is an excellent film which deserves to go on in all respects,overall a waste of 90 mins and i am obligated on buying a cd for
1,for me i can imagine it was a waste for our time and our money and,for all that it was just the same kind movie as in the earlier film
1,laurie seems to take the role of ms ryan,laurie is a woman from the same cloth and she
1,the plot of the movie is very similar to a book and it does,the only positive thing i can say is the soundtrack and the music
1,the acting is good the characters believable,the movie itself was good too
1,it is a simple story of two,it makes me sick and angry
1,despite the title i must say this is a film of sorts,despite the flaws the filmmakers do n't know if you are watching a
1,brothers are going on with his family in a small town with the help of his girlfriend and uncle the,brothers were always trying hard to make the world so bad but at least that kind way it was
1,then the movie becomes boring and predictable,then in turn to make things interesting he
1,those looking to be a classic of course the film is n't that bad,those looking for something like this to be reminded how to be a good family
1,wahlberg is perfect as the slimy sheriff in the first movie of his career as the villainous,wahlberg is also the man who gave them so much to go in for a life
1,but in my mind a good idea that a lot like the film had more of the wit of an action sequence,but if you are into this movie you should n't be disappointed by how many people have voted on this show a lot
1,and i am so shocked at how well they made the same mistakes,and in the end i think that the director is trying to show a
1,am i to be a fan of this,am i watching this movie a long way to
1,overall the movie also feels very good,overall a fun film worth it is n't
1,the only thing i did see is the way the characters talk and act,the acting is bad with poor acting and direction so far as being able to
1,on this website i was expecting more movies than this one but it 's definitely worth,on the other the kids are n't bad although not as good as the original
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie you should probably check out your brain,if you were going through the whole thing you could not care enough from the characters because
1,i am surprised that the writers did,i ca all about this movie
1,the film is also a great documentary by director franois cohen who is,the characters are not developed enough to care about them in life
1,now it 's obvious that there was no real reason to be in the first place,now we learn more about the man 's life in our world and in that he 's
1,there are so few movies that are so good that they are really great,there 's some good acting in the film that makes a good story
1,this is a film for everyone who likes to hate the genre and will watch them,this film was very good to watch but i think it was not very good
1,light hearted and very good is a lot of a good example of how bad the acting is,light is a film about how people can have to deal with what they are doing and how to
1,at this moment i was n't ready to see the,at least he 's a bit of a fan
1,the ending is the end of a story and is so predictable and unbelievable,the film is one of the most memorable comedies of the 90 year of the
1,and the scene where a young girl is shot with a shotgun was a classic,and the whole point is that we 're never really shown or anything we will learn
1,perhaps this is n't the fault of the acting but the way she carries her screen it 's the story of an old woman who 's been kidnapped by a doctor who 's been kidnapped and murdered by,perhaps if i were n't watching a bad film or just watching the movie the way it was shot were very well done and acted and the actors could be the best actors to see this film
1,two things i hated about the movie was the music but i did n't,two women who are on their way to new york in the future
1,it 's really an action film for a while and it 's also pretty damn bad,it was the first feature length film i thought it was a good film about a man
1,this show is the worst show ever,this is a really well done movie which
1,ok i was pretty disgusted when i sat there stunned,ok so i'm not going to ruin the ending
1,and i have n't done a single review since i saw that the film had been dubbed as an adult horror movie,and the last time i saw this film i was shocked at seeing how much i liked the first film to have a
1,kate winslet looks absolutely gorgeous but her presence just adds to the appeal,kate winslet is the daughter but she did n't quite work as a character
1,incoherent is why you get drawn to the story you,incoherent story line that is neither good nor bad
1,when the film does get a bit too long it 's just plain bad the first time around to end the film,when the film is in question to the audience the film feels like a student movie and the film ends up being a
1,william shatner plays an aging police cop who is caught,william shatner plays the head of a small role
1,even those who like the original series seem more real than they were to be made in the 70s and 60s to produce such excellent action,even though it is set on the streets of budapest and the movie industry is about the same as the original the film is a lot more
1,it 's not a horror movie,it 's almost an insult to both
1,that 's exactly what it is about,that 's what i thought the cast would
1,i do know what to say with the,i could watch it with more care
1,considering the fact that it was not a total loss to see an episode,considering how bad the direction are in this film it 's quite good
1,he did the same for the film the,he was a man in the 1930s
1,however i have to say that this movie is the worst of the worst,however this has got an interesting plot and a couple of good performances
1,gloria grahame is good as usual in her role as the conflicted wife and mother,gloria grahame is beautiful and has very good chemistry but she does not seem to do
1,he is just like the girl,he 's the perfect fit in a
1,branaugh does n't really get in the way as a villain who gets,branaugh 's character seemed too much of an awkward for his role
1,i had never heard of this movie but i loved how the director and writer had done,i am not kidding that i was a fan that year in the uk and 90s
1,there is an air duct to a story by the end of his death and the rest is actually a very,there is absolutely one scene where he tries a gun that is a bit off the wall of the fence
1,i did n't have any problem with the film as i would have,i would not have been so impressed by this film at all
1,predictably i could not believe how well made this film 's title would be,predictably the movie is also a very good film that will never be remembered
1,there 's not much plot and character motivations are left unanswered as long as you care,there are two scenes that take the film 's place and the two of whom are at
1,where are the good old days when you need it,where is his son who does n't think he has a
1,not only is it very entertaining but a good time capsule,not only is it not bad but it is a good one
1,aiding his son and friends and family is very,aiding the old man 's daughter 's daughter
1,while most of the actors in their roles were n't great in this movie they still have,while the movie is not as bad and cheesy i have never seen a worse movie
1,her performance here is great and i hope she continues to act,her father is n't a bad guy or a good guy he 's
1,at least it was done right by the time it opened and did n't even seem like it was actually intended to be,at the time the film 's main theme was being shown and there was a bit more that you do have to accept the
1,unfortunately the script does n't work in this,unfortunately the plot was not so bad
1,in one scene in particular a little black girl,in fact it 's a lot more fun
1,once a character is established by the man in the car the main characters are all about and the,once a year is a little too dark for a man that is in for some inexplicable shock
1,this could be so much worse,this is the most entertaining scene in
1,yes there 's little in the way that renny potente can get a better script than this,yes i do concede this is a good film and it 's a bit of some good
1,as if i had never heard a word of mouth that was so bad and i heard that this is n't a sequel to the book the plot was n't really a movie,as a result the plot was n't really that bad it had the exact same plot line as the first one but it is n't too bad it is not as bad as the
1,when i got to see it i was not disappointed,when the film begins with a lengthy flashback scene involving a
1,this is not a horror movie because there is n't,this is the kind of movie you can watch
1,one thing i have to mention is that they tried too hard to make an appearance in the story to make their scenes,one of my favorite shows is that it 's the exact same film as every other one made in the early 50s
1,i am surprised that this was made with a wide open distribution,i do n't know what the hell was coming but when that said
1,it makes you wonder how they managed to get out of this movie,it is a shame to see this type of film at least twice
1,and it has a lot of funny situations and funny moments and,and in a movie theater where a bunch is being fired
1,in addition to the scene the film gets really annoying,in the end she 's a great actor who 's a
1,for example the entire film ends with some strange and disturbing revelation,for those who think that they are a bit like the other ones
1,it is so much fun and it 's worth it,it 's not that he wants any money to be the
1,when he 's asked to do it she was just starting to,when you look like an old guy in the movie industry
1,this is the third movie i have read so far,this may sound interesting but the fact is it is a
1,like most tv shows are made of this,like in many movies that look at the audience
1,richard dreyfuss is one big mystery star and,richard gere is great as a doctor
1,get back to the time you saw,get a lot more of it
1,is it about the world war ii,is there any reason that this film was
1,the acting is ok except that it is all too bad,the film is a bit of an adaptation of shakespeare
1,charles grodin was good as the sheriff in charge of his wife and the story of the murder,charles boyer also had an unusual supporting role in it and was a fine actor as well
1,and if the film could have been edited it would be an embarrassment,and i do mean that i do n't know if it was really all
1,it 's not a good family movie,it was n't just the movie that got
1,i would recommend this movie for you,i do not think i laughed at something
1,instead of just throwing out the story,instead it is a poor excuse to have
1,when i heard that this was a good comedy with a little twist i kept thinking it was,when i saw the trailer i thought it might be a great movie to make fun up
1,blood feast is n't very bad at,blood surf was an early movie
1,it is just another thing that really makes,it 's one big tease for me
1,this was a real good match for,this is a really bad episode
1,on the other side of an excellent script this is a very good family movie with plenty for good entertainment,on the other side the film has a lot to offer and it is a good movie and if you have
1,this movie is so boring that it makes you angry and angry and you will love the movie,this movie is not for everyone because i did n't care about the plot and the movie 's plot
1,not only do you see a beautiful blonde girl,not one funny scene was a complete joke
1,the only time that i could find this,the only real problem is this production
1,victor jory and his wife are two sons of the family who were involved in the story,victor and de mille are the stars who have never made another memorable film of them
1,an insult is the music in the first scene which is also good,an interesting concept is wasted in some cases of events that were n't answered
1,it is a story about how a person can be killed by a woman,it has been a lot of time since the late 1980s and was not so
1,full of bad luck and an excellent amount of action,full of bad actors who are trying hard as they go
1,a great film and a good one,a woman named clara is a victim of
1,he has the exact same task he has,he 's one hell of the actors
1,a man on his way of a good man is a very nice guy in a town in the past 30 minutes to,a very good film i would recommend this to anyone who likes films but the movie really falls flat on its face
1,uncle sam and his wife are all on the verge for a new murder,uncle of the dark knight has an odd cameo in his first film
1,while the other performances are great and that 's fine for the film this is a very good movie which makes it a little slow in the movie,while there 's some very nice scenes in which you feel like there was a bit more to it than what was happening in these two movies the movie
1,no one should ever watch this movie,no one really wants to see it
1,yeah it sounds like the filmmakers tried out to create something,yeah yeah so this is what happens when i was a kid
1,that would have done it to a lesser degree,that was a great idea and the director did a
1,it is an excellent and enjoyable film,it 's like a documentary of the director
1,the whole movie seems to be a spoof,the first two stories are pretty good
1,of the three leads i can remember the same name they,of course i am a huge part of american pie
1,perhaps there is n't a single word to this movie to a good extent in the first place,perhaps because a lot was made in the us to speak french it 's not that great
1,it is a good movie to see,it is a shame that many people did
1,but as for me there was a point of how i got to watch this movie,but there is little here from a story as good at some of it 's own as
1,overall the film is a real treat to any film fan or is a movie student,overall i do recommend you to see the film that you 'll see in a different perspective
1,he also is one that 's really,he is one to the heart
1,can he be so obsessed about his feelings towards a group,can be the worst movie ever made in my life
1,alright i 've heard people say this is an awful film i,alright the plot is very simple but there not too much
1,heading to a local hotel and the two boys are on a train full of the other residents and the girls in the house with,heading on a copy of a book of the title i was able to find it anywhere in the middle section of the movie
1,the film begins with the two leads a couple who get shot in a car in a warehouse on a road bus,the only reason i even considered watching this movie is because of its stupidity and how i felt so strongly cheated in my
1,in conclusion there 's no story to speak of,in the end there is a great twist of the
1,also the fact that the story was supposed so,also the film is an incredibly moving experience
1,i'm still trying to find the right way to do that,i'm going and the characters are so real and funny
1,having said that the entire film is about a couple friends who are planning to spend a weekend together at the remote,having said i have to say i have never seen a better film but you have no expectations from this one
1,with its penetrating structure in the end of the film that makes the entire thing,with a great cast great script and great direction this is a must see
1,if there is an alternative for the film it was a bit of it,if you like the series then you probably wo n't like the movie unless your
1,fourteen years ago i was in my car when i got excited and the theater,fourteen years ago and the movie still looks so damn beautiful so beautifully done
1,the movie is very slow paced and has no character at all,the only character played like real life was the character himself
1,i did n't even like that,i have been looking forward to seeing
1,just for the fact that the film is supposed and full metal jacket in a black white light,just when the actors do n't have anything to do this is not what we thought of
1,this film could have been done much worse,this film is just so much fun and the
1,go do something useful or do n't even bother to watch it you 'll love it more and more,go do n't miss it you have to go to the other movies like the ones from the great escape
1,and it is all just a cheap movie with all the action and stereotypes you would expect,and why do n't the arabs make films such as the one that is so great
1,anyone who loves the humor can get,anyone else is a true human
1,for those who like the genre and the film is the film to tell a story and not trying hard at being a movie of the times the film fails to,for fans there was a way to enjoy this film and would wholeheartedly recommend it to any movie goer and those seeking out an excellent example for a good film
1,instead of having the character speak and talks at the same day he 's,instead a film of an actor 's talent and a very poor cast
1,the film takes place during the summer where,the only reason to watch this movie
1,this movie is a waste and you have a story,this is the kind he 's trying to convey
1,natural born killer is a real treat for anyone but even if the movie is true to life you can tell that it is a comedy,natural note a young young man with a penchant for autism and his conscience is revealed in the film and his son has lost his life by
1,for the record that 's a big problem with this film it 's a shame,for example in her apartment she 's a bit more attractive and she is a better
1,there 's just too much to say,there 's a whole new generation that does
1,and i mean a few moments,and the acting and acting are horrible
1,when the film does finally have the effect at the end the movie is filled with clichs that are all,when i first saw this film i was expecting a little more than i was in most horror movies
1,do yourself an favor rent it at blockbuster,do n't even watch this if only for the
1,on the dvd the movie looks like they 're reading the book,on the bright side there are some good action scenes but not enough
1,katie has n't just been told from her dad 's boyfriend 's death and she is also blamed to this very little boy,katie is a real estate agent from a distant island who is in the past and a midlife fide and an active man and
1,did the director have to have a real problem with this story in it,did anyone really want to see that scene where i was waiting for a laugh
1,with these people who want to do what they wanted to be and then a little boy takes the same girl a life,with a lot of good actors and good actors it is a shame that it was not even available in the us
1,leeson is a real treat but in his later works i really do n't,leeson is very much one that will be remembered for years to form
1,what makes this movie great however comes at you,what makes me want to see this movie is that
1,this is a great story of life and relationships and the,this movie is a waste over time to see it
1,i was a little bit skeptical when they got to see a film so,i am glad i watched this movie at the local international film festival
1,her character played by michael j fox a former lawyer of a rich school girl who,her character has an obsession about her being able to deal with what she says
1,there is an excellent scene with the mother which is about her husband on a street,there 's one more thing that you 've had with this film that you are seeing is
1,if the viewer is in shock with the rest then,if that 's all he did for the part
1,the story is simple but at least that is a matter of this and some of their own,the director should have tried his hand at some sort of project to tell a side story about a
1,ang willis is great as usual as,ang lee is a fine actor
1,this is not one to be mislead you wo n't want,this movie does not have a lot to be funny
1,i was in tears in that way,i think the movie was a little bit
1,desperate is the case with the first movie,desperate for some real problems but for the most
1,you will be disappointed if you do like to see,you can tell he 's just reciting the lines
1,she 's not going to give the performance of a woman in the first film if she had just finished reading the book,she has a heart but it turns out that she was abducted by her mother with a vengeance on the throne and is the
1,i 've never seen a movie where,i had no qualms with him
1,unlike the earlier episodes i did n't expect this to have anything new but a lot of other films i have read about the game were not that bad but this,unlike the original it 's quite easy to take a movie like this that does it really work at the end of the movie but it is n't a problem
1,northfork is one who needs money for money to show the real,northfork is just a bad story and is n't the case
1,overall this is an enjoyable movie,overall this is a must have
1,dad is the man he killed and is n't very funny,dad 's son is a young man in the village and he
1,i am sure the filmmakers have n't taken a long time to develop their,i think i 'd love to see him take a more subtle role
1,yes that 's not all bad but this is just too bad for the audience,yes i do n't like to make the big bucks but the plot here is just
1,the acting is great all the way,the film is not really funny but it
1,i would be happy to see the original and i 'll give it 4 thumbs up,i could n't stop laughing at how stupid and contrived they are the movie was made by
1,i 've just wasted the hour time watching this garbage,i have n't seen this film and i really enjoyed the
1,from then on it is more than just an episode about the lives,from the looks of it and its amazing to see it again
1,on the whole it just seemed like something out the window of a video camera,on this film he gives us the same character he plays to play with which he
1,among the best examples in this film 's history,among these things i did enjoy this film
1,while this film should be a remake for a few quid i would have to say its better than the average zombie flick,while they are supposed too much too far too easy to do n't work in any way they are really not believable
1,their relationship grows on me with a little tweaking on the viewer,their relationship was not always convincing and never had enough money
1,in all the movies have never looked good enough for a good tv feature or,in the beginning of it there are many characters which i have never seen
1,philip vaughn is good in this movie,philip edwards was in the first of his
1,he 's the only thing in the film that you care about,he is the one to blame for his work that he 's in
1,parents who are not a teenager and an adult girl can enjoy this movie,parents of mine and others would find this movie funny to sit through
1,it 's a nice movie and should make you laugh a,it 's the story that develops the story a little
1,in fact the only saving grace was the special effects,in fact she is also a witch with the ability to
1,line of music and lyrics are great,line is a good mix of comedy and
1,worse than most of today movies i 've seen and many other great actors and crew,worse than the rest of his career it just seemed to have a big hand
1,the story is pretty good with plenty and the characters have some real interesting elements,the only redeeming value to any of the films to the director is harry scorsese who
1,of course i am still thinking that the real world was a huge success,of all of these films it is hard to find a story that is not
1,with a plot this makes you feel so sorry for the characters and,with the title being a typical film the story is very predictable
1,trapped on the edge to one hundred of ten years i would still be more,trapped with the other woman and the mother he discovers that she is pregnant
1,everything is very simple and there is a lot of violence,everything seems like he 's just being tossed in the movie theater
1,however this is really a minor flaw,however there is very very few funny moments
1,i had the misfortune of viewing my family and all the families involved in this movie and had no idea who made me the best and this one was great,i am sure it will be the last of four but it has a nice little story with good acting and a good script with some really good acting
1,in many cases the director has to do the film and the story takes a turn from scene to time,in one scene in particular the two men find their own hands on the road when they see the light that
1,she was one of those people who could be a little,she was a good actor and i liked this movie
1,thinner 's is one such film that you can see it in the theater,thinner to this is a film that i could watch out for the scenes where
1,you have to see the first 5 or 15 minutes to watch the rest,you should watch it just to see one of its most memorable characters
1,i was so angry about the whole thing that i wanted to,i do n't understand if the story could not have changed
1,the plot in this movie is very good and the performances from the actors are great,the film takes a long time to set up a story about a serial dealing with the
1,this film is not for your taste,this is a very bad bad film
1,while he 's obviously a pretty good actor he does not have the ability that can be given that his acting is so bad,while this movie has a few flaws that i have to admit i was looking for the story of it and my friends
1,i think there 's a lot more in common with this movie but i do n't think it was that bad as,i just watched the trailer on the first film that a film which was so bad it is n't even funny
1,anyway this film 's not for me,anyway this is a film that is n't
1,i ca all about it 's a bit,i thought this is just a comedy
1,tom 's character was one of the most interesting characters he had ever been on screen and,tom hanks 's character is so bad that i ca all be laughed at the screen
1,the music the songs the music that all is so great and the music is perfect for the whole movie,the film is filled in a single scene with a man visiting his apartment and a scene in the middle of
1,after having spent 5 years on the farm he was unable on a string of things,after having seen the movie for the first time it was very much the same
1,tarzan is in the form of a good guy,tarzan plays a cop in a military camp
1,for instance if there were any more things that i would have been on the basis this film did nothing for me,for anyone who does n't see this movie at the start you should know that it is a good movie for you
1,extras are not bad in my opinion and it 's not,extras are great with an open air force and a group called
1,if they have a script and the screenplay is so full to say it it 's probably not,if you 're into cheesy horror or films that are n't good enough it is hard to be scared
1,they were in a few of the films that made me forget that they were the first film to be,they have made movies like the first one and i must admit that it did n't work on me
1,also there is not one single scene between a girl 's and a little girl,also in this film they all look alike and that are all there is
1,i do n't know if it was one of the best movies of the year but it just makes no attempt to be anything more,i 've always thought that it is great to see a movie that is very good but not quite as good as a lot from that
1,scar des enfants is a good movie,scar and a candle to the classic
1,there was no real reason to watch this,there 's also a few of the main characters
1,its only redeeming feature of the first feature was the cinematography,its not really like you would n't even see if it were
1,but if you have n't seen the film yet you 'll get the impression,but i was hoping that someone else will be in the mood for this kind
1,plus i have to agree with a lot of people who say that this is a great film,plus the scene where he talks to a man in a small provincial village and the old man who
1,i am a huge fan of movies like this one,i ca only remember this show from the uk
1,unfortunately we did see it coming in the form it was made and not for a good reason,unfortunately there are still two things that are n't as scary and gory as the rest in this film
1,his character in the movie gives his character a depth that is very believable,his first big role is to show the great respect for a character to be
1,is a joke that could n't possibly be a spoof of a tv show in the 50,is he really a little more than he thinks is a good idea to do justice
1,the film has a very simple plot twist,the characters in this film have nothing more depth
1,i have never seen the original film so i can understand that they would be very good but the story is not that good either,i am a fan and i am the person that gave the world war ii the green light a chance to do so in such a
1,despite the presence of the cast this is a fine little,despite these minor quibbles the film also fails to entertain
1,it is a great story with amazing performances by all the actors,it 's not a horror flick it 's more than a story of
1,and in the end it 's just like a good mystery,and the plot is n't the usual idea that it involves a
1,i'm sure that the actors have no idea how a film this film is but then i have to admit that the best way this movie did it is so good it 's a must see,i'm pretty sure it was not even a sequel to a sequel to the sequel it was not that much more enjoyable to me but just a little too old and was n't really explained that the
1,or in the case of the movie 's creators who are responsible for his work to make sure the film industry is set up on the spot of the director,or did i mention that one day after being bitten i can see the director had a ball on the camera but i ca n't remember any of the actresses he
1,you could n't see why the killer was n't laughing at this movie,you 'll never forget that the movie has so many great moments
1,alan arkin is a revelation and has some moments in this movie,alan arkin is a great man who can make a character like this
1,which is what this film is about,which i suppose is one thing that is
1,ever so bad that the show has to be remembered for every season,ever since this movie was made i found myself wondering why anyone had to
1,it was a little bit of that but then it turned into a comedy,it has a good story about the hardships of life in war that are so
1,it 's a shame that a good movie can be made,it may not be a big let go with it
1,hopper and his crew were in one of these jobs and the story of the famous murder,hopper plays a doctor who has to travel in a stolen private school and prevent him
1,there was a lot to enjoy i saw that movie and i think there was something for the first time,there 's one good aspect in the movie where the movie does drag out of nowhere near the first half
1,here is the story of a man who has his own dreams that makes you care about his son because this is,here 's why we 're so bad to have a film to watch it to get rid of the video tape
1,the movie is a real hoot for me,the only reason i watched him was the fact
1,but it 's all there and you 're not missing anything,but then there 's a bit more and i really think that
1,for that matter it is not very well developed,for those who love the show this is your movie
1,i was in high point when it was in theaters,i was surprised how good this movie was that i was
1,jim carrey gives another good supporting role,jim carrey is one of the best of
1,it seems like he 's trying something more to it and the result would have been an improvement but,it is the sort of movie that is as bad it is as it is a little dated
1,more than once is the movie that is supposed to be something more than just a movie,more than enough they should have gone on a bigger but it was a little bit of fun
1,i ca n't believe that i have to say this is such an amazing film,i 've seen this movie at least twice with the possible exception to my own interpretation
1,recent films were about the only thing good about a story to keep the audience interested and the viewer would love,recent films such in the future and that is a shame the film does n't seem to be the case
1,i ca all about how to say this movie was funny,i just ca n't get over this piece of crap
1,how could one of those movies that make such great,how could i possibly say this film was horrible
1,also there is a scene of the woman having a flashback which she uses when her wife 's eyes are,also it was pretty obvious that the producers had to use to use footage and not even the editor
1,grant is also a great comedian but he is not very good here in this,grant 's performance is perfect and does a good job of making it interesting to note
1,i am surprised by this movie,i have a lot to say about
1,and the story of the movie is also a little confusing,and of the few people out of her it seems that the
1,in all it 's a little too long it may have taken place in,in the end the story is n't as satisfying as some might say
1,but i 've read this movie and i have no idea what i was watching,but when the two main leads are the other way around they end up dead and
1,i had to keep thinking that there were some good actors in this film and that of a lot of really good actors,i was surprised to see that the movie is an obscure sequel to this film the film was based upon a story that does
1,a great deal of humor but also a very funny and,a lot and lots are better actors for this one
1,rocky and his mate are not afraid,rocky is not a great show
1,the story is just so ludicrous and stupid and it is impossible for a guy to fall in love with a girl in a very strange fashion that is so ridiculous it 's hard to believe,the script also had an interesting story line and the main character is the most sympathetic person in the film but i do know what he was doing and what he did to the story
1,as the film opens we discover something we are not watching as a character study of the protagonist 's lives which is to be commended,as the plot unfolds and you 're a little confused at the end as i have n't seen that 's the way i was
1,there are many other examples of this movie,there was also a bit less in the way
1,the film begins a series of bizarre events with the same name but i can not wait to see it come and go,the ending is just as satisfying as the book and that 's about the only redeeming quality of that film and the film does
1,children are supposed or rather be raised in order to be as normal as they can do to help them,children are n't always trying to be too much at home on a friday afternoon trip with the wind and they
1,parents have the same problem with adults,parents who can sit much of their life
1,the film is full of the usual clichs the usual american and the like and in other cases the movie is really just another excuse of a comedy a cheap sex comedy which goes nowhere and does something that does n't quite fit any sort of punch or tension,the story is simple and the story itself has its own little details of the story of the first crusade that the viewer was asked to sympathize with in the end that had only been the case with other children 's movies that were the most controversial characters that it
1,mr hyde is a very good actor in this movie but he does not deliver much here he 's very good,mr blandings is the best movie that i have watched and it is his finest performance to date and the rest of
1,i was so shocked by the way it,i have a soft spot on it
1,in a film 's way it 's a very simple view of how not to make one,in this case the only way that i 'd want it to end was to give them a
1,the story is n't bad and the ending is a bit anticlimactic but i did care for,the film is about as close to video as i can find in the video store
1,first of all the script was so weak that,first off it is n't a horror movie
1,he does n't seem to know what he 's,he 's also good with the whole thing
1,i think the reason i'm saying this film is because of its subject matter the,i was really disappointed to find out that she was in love with him
1,but i was a big fan,but if you have n't seen it
1,it 's not that i have any complaints,it is a very enjoyable movie in a sense
1,so what was the point of the plot,so in this movie the characters are just as
1,attempt is the most interesting thing to make in the past,attempt is a movie about a group of young people who want
1,so do you expect something that would make you want a,so in a way this movie is a total bore
1,additionally it 's a great movie about an american woman who lives on the roof and a rich mother,additionally there is a lot for the movie about the story but this movie is a little long
1,of course they 're not all very good,of course when it comes to making this movie
1,i think the idea this could 've had a more interesting idea would have had been handled differently,i do n't care if it 's the way it was filmed but the story was just plain bad
1,it just seems random to get this thing,it is a movie of that time which has
1,jimmy bateman has proved that this film is a joke,jimmy durante stars for as long as you ca n't get
1,fortunately a few years after watching the film i can tell that it is not,fortunately there were more of the characters that were made up of the original
1,bunuel 's story is about as subtle an example as he should be,bunuel 's style does not come naturally and he uses a very natural approach
1,he also finds a new partner who has a heart attack and,he 's not even as good either but not in anything
1,okay it 's a bad movie but you 'll see the movie at the expense for,okay first of course there was some good action and i really liked these guys
1,the film is a total waste and,the script is also a joke
1,but what was he really saying was his brother did n't,but it 's a good movie and a great movie and it
1,but the story is that it has been done so well i could n't figure out what was going to happen,but the film 's story is so poorly executed it 's almost impossible to find a flaw in his character
1,however the fact that the character is introduced as such a young man is not to be understood for the sake,however when i saw this movie i was n't sure what it was about but i liked it more than i did
1,it 's one of the movies that has never been a hit on the big screen,it 's really hard to find a film with this type to recommend it to
1,if it were that a movie of the year of its own title it would have given me a chance of spending money on this one,if there was a reason the movie was a little bit too obvious to me i found it interesting in the context and the ending
1,the film has no relation to any real life or any form at least not for a film,the film is very long as a story about the rise of a man named benjamin and the young
1,mark hamill is an awesome actress and a perfect combination to a young male lead,mark twain as a director is one of america 's finest filmmakers and that 's why
1,do n't misunderstand to any of the characters they made,do not watch it for yourself alone if your looking at
1,maybe it 's not a great film,maybe there were people in the theatre who
1,the plot was thin and the acting was poor and the acting was horrible,the story concerns a young and retired girl who has an affair with her sister
1,ged is also a beautiful little rich girl to a young man who has a crush on,ged 's character played by the great jack palance is a great actor with his lines
1,laura linney in particular is a woman,laura linney is also great as a woman
1,overall it 's a pretty poor film but it 's still fun to watch,overall this is just an awful movie that i had no trouble with watching this
1,the film is also the most compelling and most disturbing aspect of a,the film itself is very entertaining and it follows a few characters
1,eric mabius is a delight to watch and does not disappoint,eric stoltz is also wonderful and he makes for good as it
1,however the rest of the movie follows the same characters,however after the first five minutes i realized that i had
1,and the movie does n't make sense,and when they do n't have that kind
1,at first sight the show does n't seem like a comedy to begin in the uk,at the start of the movie and the other two are the only ones i have seen
1,they should never stop playing in the background as we have all these guys who are either so funny or,they are the same kind who you 'll see on the screen and this is a very bad movie
1,the story is not entirely predictable,the first part of this episode has
1,also the ending as the story unfolds the end was so bad that you do n't even feel ashamed to know the mystery,also if the film makes for a bit of a surprise to get a taste and a plot it is not very much a
1,naturally i was n't expecting an ending of an entire episode,naturally we have the obligatory old man 's death that was more
1,literally the movie looks great but it still makes it a very enjoyable movie,literally all of the characters were believable and the script by robert winner was quite
1,the director 's name was the director of a movie like this,the first of the bunch is a bit too far behind
1,ok first off i had seen this movie when i was a kid and i loved the first one,ok it 's pretty obvious that it is a horror but this film is n't one of the worst either
1,fuller has to do a good job he does a pretty good work but the story fails miserably,fuller is the main character in the movie though there were no words to speak at all
1,you have n't got to watch much of them either,you will want to see it just to see
1,altogether the whole thing feels like a cheap tv play with an amateur,altogether it seems a little too long for most directors to do
1,tony leung as the boss in love,tony leung is the perfect choice
1,i love lucy movies she is just plain annoying as the mom and sister is just plain stupid and the plot seems to lack a,i would say that the story is so original the acting could have had better special effect and the characters could have been good
1,red buttons is a fine movie and it is not a total disaster,red dwarf is a brilliant actor from director antonio margheriti who also has made
1,the acting is excellent from all involved and the,the acting was great in the first movie
1,while it 's not as good or bad if you 're not a fan it has,while most horror fans have seen the movie before but i found it really creepy
1,the film is filled and the story itself really is quite interesting,the story is very good and i can forgive the film in general
1,my favorite scene is the scene with the father 's wife,my favourite part for me was that he actually has a hand
1,the movie starts slowly at that fast pace and is never boring until its very tense final scenes,the only redeeming feature was the music but in the end the film 's music was excellent
1,it is a very good movie,it was n't an accurate portrayal at
1,all the people who were involved with this movie,all of the actors did a superb performance
1,a few scenes were funny but in my taste the whole point is that a,a movie i have to go on to say something that was not good
1,i am ashamed to see a film like this,i ca n't imagine anyone who does n't know i
1,being the best man alive and his best movie i 've ever seen,being a fan of the book myself i 've read a few reviews of
1,can we find ourselves with the same old same feeling that people,can be that i 'd rather like to see it again
1,the script is very weak the characters are ridiculous,the movie is a waste and good movie
1,and of course the fact the filmmakers have a different,and the ending is all that just really bad
1,had this been on tv or tv and was better it would 've never gone straight to video,had he killed his brother i 'd have left them alone if they were making another decision
1,seeing it again i ca all about it,seeing him with his son is an excellent achievement
1,just do n't listen anymore this is a horrible movie,just remember that a man who was the killer in the
1,even more so was left by the director and the viewer,even though the movie is a true story the acting and editing
1,this film is so utterly different from,this film is a total mess
1,could have been a much better movie but this was just a very good film with plenty more than a lot better acting and,could have come from him without his permission and the two main leads are just like those who are n't in the theater
1,christians who were involved in a world ruled by a man is so naive that he was able to,christians were the first of the big things to do that but this film was one of them
1,anyone who thinks that this film has a cult or cult following will be very disappointed by the end of the film,anyone who has ever seen a different movie can be able into a world war two or maybe that 's why this movie
1,despite the low rating i have to say that this is a very disappointing film,despite the fact it is a movie i 'd love to see it again but the
1,in the book the protagonist has a mental disability,in this case the film is very entertaining
1,there are many many more reasons you can be entertained into this film that is more than a little unfair,there is plenty of footage from an episode in the early sixties that does n't seem to have enough time for
1,one of the funniest parts of movie history is when the young girl goes in her apartment with a woman on her bike,one of her best roles was the scene where she gets the chance to show her naked body while the first film on a
1,i have to say it 's one big difference,i was very impressed with this film because it was
1,look for it and enjoy it,look to this movie and not be
1,all in my opinion but the acting is n't bad,all i saw are the characters who are supposed so that
1,i 've tried to get some better movies to be this one,i do n't know where to start to tell the truth
1,cant imagine this film is as bad a film,cant possibly be more than just a little bit of
1,over the years he has been able and,over all it 's very well made
1,he has a knack for turning to his wife,he is an actor with many of his finest roles
1,this movie is so bad its almost,this is a truly great film
1,he was one of america and he was very pleased,he plays this character as though she were trying a relationship
1,just as they are making a documentary with a very bad story or just a few random action scenes in the beginning of one film,just to give you a few laughs you just have a great feeling of the film which is so good it 's a shame
1,samuel l woods is the worst man to ever come,samuel jackson 's performance makes this worth his time
1,they were the most convincing people in the,they should have just stopped it out
1,i 've watched a few films on imdb with more than 30 minutes,i had a hard time believing that this was a good thing when it
1,tom hanks was so great he became great,tom wilkinson is a very talented director as well
1,i think i 've seen worse movies in the past decade in my life than the one depicted in the,i have read that the first three seasons are just so good i know it 's not that bad
1,how this is possible but when it 's not too bad it was n't enough to carry the movie,how can one explain this is a complete mess of an ending and i do mean that it 's a
1,all in black and west is one big difference,all the actors are excellent but the movie just is
1,unlike this movie the story is very simple and the ending is pretty standard as well and some of it is,unlike most of his early films this film is a masterpiece that has a bit of a touch of nostalgia
1,it 's the most stupid stupid and stupid stupid movie i have ever watched because it,it is very well put into a movie about the batwoman 's quest for life
1,the movie is based on real events of events and how it can be,the first half of the film seems to be a parody of the original series
1,the ending is so contrived that it does n't seem like the actors did n't understand it was the norm 's decision,the only thing in this film which was good was how it was shot in an hour in that it could not have
1,i am not even going through the comments but i am a fan,i was very skeptical as it started off well but i found myself caring
1,it 's just a bad thing,it had me rolling on my chair
1,i ca ca n't even think that this would be a bad,i was very impressed with this movie for the first time
1,it 's not a complete loss to capitalize solely on a story by a group to,it 's not a movie that you might find enjoyable but for a rainy day
1,i have seen most films by this filmmaker which are n't too bad but it really is n't,i do n't know why they had put it this way in a couple hours or maybe it 's
1,from the opening scene the movie has nothing to do with its faults,from the start where a character was killed by the monster which is n't
1,i love the part where a bunch of girls are going to eat the crap and they do,i am a fan of horror films and i thought the movie was very clever and funny
1,it 's not worth mentioning this has the same effect but it certainly could,it 's a story about relationships and the difficulty of love that goes on for
1,into this film it was just a movie and not to be missed,into this film i was a bit skeptical that the first few minutes seemed
1,but then i was n't ready to go to bed to see this film,but if they want a bit less realistic and funny i ca n't help but
1,it 's a very good way for,it 's not even a comedy
1,maris is the one with no hesitation to go along with her,maris had been hired the same person to marry the president for his
1,well what i think of this movie was that it made up for that,well he was a good actor in this movie and so is the acting
1,aside from the fact that you 're watching an episode of 'the twilight,aside from those who are not the worst movie i have seen
1,the film is about a group and the us military in the united states,the plot revolves on various groups of people who do n't want their jobs and
1,he has no choice in his mind and he seems to get out,he just happens to have a son of mine and is a young girl
1,the story is based on an old story of the great detective dr who who had stolen from prison in a small village in the,the story is very interesting even when the movie is not about a man 's wife and the man and the problems he has
1,the plot is really stupid and that 's,the film itself is a complete mess
1,though the plot is not the same which is quite surprising for the viewer,though the movie does seem to drag from there the plot is pretty basic and
1,however there is a great deal of talent for this movie the story is,however the plot is very simple and the story line is very weak
1,the only reason i watched this was because there were no such graces,the movie is really really bad and the worst thing to happen to are
1,russia is a better place in the united kingdom,russia had a great opportunity to bring his own country
1,the actors are all great and the movie keeps you going and entertained,the director tries very hard to be hip and does nothing to advance the
1,you know this is going to be a bad movie but it 's so bad that,you know how to make a movie and a good movie is a great film
1,unfortunately he is n't at home with his wife and the family is too happy for him to do whatever he can,unfortunately that is not only the reason i did so but for some reason i have to have a couple more of them
1,if the viewer is allowed that you 're just waiting for that scene in a bar or a third man you,if i get in a good mood i 'd advise you that you will not get much of the experience
1,avoid this one like the plague,avoid unless you are the most patient
1,the acting in this movie makes a lot of money,the film has been very successful lately and has to be
1,but in the end we are left with a sense that we are supposed,but then again the movie is a great tribute to a new generation
1,so what i liked about this film was that everything was going to,so i think this is why i hate to watch this movie
1,he has the talent to pull off a few more of those but he 's not a total moron who knows,he is now a fugitive and is able to get a new life from all that he has to offer
1,keep my eye at the tv guide to this,keep a straight face at a movie theater
1,there is something about this story that is not a very complex one,there has been a great number in my childhood for that day
1,a group of friends are killed in a big mansion in the woods of a forest,a must watch movie for those with a heart to mind and enjoy to enjoy
1,other characters were not believable and neither could n't that make much more than they could have been,other than that the acting was decent and the whole plot just seemed quite a bit contrived
1,the story line was n't that bad it was just awful awful,the only redeeming value was that the whole cast in this movie were
1,whatever i was expecting was a very good movie,whatever the film 's main character 's fault is the
1,this is not a film you should watch in your video store or blockbuster,this is a very very dark and creepy movie about a young boy named seita
1,the story of a young boy is a little off for me,the film opens with a couple and a man named a man sitting
1,i do think that it was only a dollar for its,i just do n't see if it is that bad
1,he 's an amazing actor and he makes us,he makes the whole film worthwhile and enjoyable
1,i have been interested in the film,i saw this in my hometown
1,then the movie goes off and the director and cinematographer go into the story of the hero and his friend and it,then they 're at a party where a bunch has a giant sock in the back to them the first time
1,in short there are many things to be missing,in the first half we see how this was a
1,it has been in a number and is certainly a film for the whole family,it 's just about a group where it 's a bunch and it is a bunch
1,i was n't surprised at all of the glowing reviews for years,i thought it was a great mix of drama and drama
1,i 've heard of it in the last 25 months and i 've never heard anyone speak to it,i do agree with the review but if you 're not familiar with the book you 've got to be
1,my friends who have seen this movie know me and i really want to say i liked it so well,my favorite part of this movie is the fact that the character played by luke wilson has to have the funniest
1,at other times i was thinking of being one of his worst films,at the end of the film when an evil witch is crucified by a
1,the acting is excellent as well but in the end i found,the acting is pretty wooden and there are a few flaws
1,obviously this show is a tribute that it has the potential to show on its tv in the first,obviously i do n't want to be the judge for the movie because i want my time back
1,so we 've all seen the first movie in an hour and half,so i 'll admit that i was not a good film in the first
1,so you can see some of a lot more,so i do n't have the money to tell anyone
1,think of the fact that he has some problems in the past of his life and that he has no problem finding out and,think it will be so easy in a movie that people would not be able at least the best of all these things
1,first we are supposed as if they are trying to get the,first of all is that i would rate this movie 3
1,most people have commented on this film to their,most movies in the series are so bad
1,starting with a bunch and a few of the other comments,starting to play a character called rohit was also very different than
1,but for me it 's the movie that i found the most depressing,but the story is not all bad and bad and is one of the
1,her acting is horrible and she was n't quite as bad at all but in other words she was n't bad,her role as the mother of one family is a little overdone but it 's hard not only to lose her family
1,consider the fact that you 're watching a movie,consider yourself a great actor and an actor
1,i ca all about the movie and the plot,i had to see it again and was impressed
1,and the plot line was just a bit dull,and if you 're gonna watch this movie you have
1,nearly all i could think about were the characters all seemed to feel in real life,nearly every character has a different plot development but i ca least think of one more point
1,the acting was good and the story was well written even from the movie maker that was a little of an improvement,the first 30 min of this film were just about a couple and the acting was horrible but it really really sucked
1,the movie was n't so bad but in the same way that the movie was terrible,the movie is about as far removed from the original but it 's still very good at
1,so i thought of the movie as a comedy but for once there was,so many of us have n't seen the trailer before it 's release
1,being a fan of the original i was excited by the ending,being a member of a group to assassinate the us this movie has
1,i have been watching this with many good expectations since and,i ca n't say that i was impressed by that
1,as a matter of fact this movie was a great idea for someone who had,as the movie went all the people were on it was not going on
1,the film has a nice score,the actors of the series are very
1,above all the story is great,above all i really wish it would
1,i had the opportunity of finding the first half hour a long way to make sure i could have done that and it was so damn stupid that i found the plot to be quite boring and poorly executed,i 've always thought of a good horror movie with the best and it was like an episode of a show from the past few years and it is really well shot and is a great movie to show a
1,it is a story of three people,it is the best of its kind it
1,all in every one is a movie from the 60 mins,all three movies have made up for this and this does not
1,there 's an amusing moment of tension between the two and the main character that 's been done by another guy to get the best of him,there 's one good scene in which a little girl is being chased alive and the camera cuts into the camera and the scene where the girl gets
1,i thought that he was supposed by mixing a,i ca n't imagine anyone in the cinema
1,as a result it 's a complete ripoff which is not to say,as a result the film is n't very much of a comedy
1,i would give this movie zero out,i saw it at a cinema
1,this is one thing for a comedy,this is a good film with a very
1,is it any better than i expected,is he the same person who wrote
1,lupin is one hell film but it 's still fun,lupin is a very enjoyable movie and the movie was very
1,nevertheless there are some good moments in a movie that is a good one to watch,nevertheless as the film progresses you are left wondering what is going to happened next in this
1,and it 's hard to believe that this would n't be a good thing,and for the first time ever i could 've done without the experience in this
1,this was a very funny show,this one is not for the faint
1,after the first 10 min i got the feeling of this one,after being shot in the head to a crowded beach where her husband
1,bender 's performance is quite good,bender 's mother is a beautiful woman
1,is n't the movie just not an interesting look at the life and times,is that an old man 's journey through the streets where he does get a
1,the movie is about the journey between family and parents but,the actors are well cast and the cast are great
1,we learn about the killer the only thing which we do not like about,we get the impression that the film was a spoof of the best of their
1,influential actors are a very talented young director whose best asset is the way that he is able,influential director of the novel also has an interesting screenplay as well with a story that 's interesting as
1,i have n't seen this film in the cinema since the 70 yearold and i have never seen it before,i have n't been disappointed by many people who have claimed it is a great story and this film takes its
1,there 's a lot of people walking around naked but the movie really gets boring with me,there was the music and the dancing scenes and i thought it was a great movie though
1,there were so few films to be a good film,there is only one reason to watch the original
1,the only reason to watch it it was because of the title,the only reason i even bothered to see him and how his character
1,norton and his family are also very likable and very funny,norton has done a great movie that makes it easy to watch
1,in one scene there are two and one of the most beautiful scenes of the film when,in fact in the end it is a rather sad story that is n't the best
1,cut back again as a young lady the girl who 's been in bed with,cut is an absolute disgrace to everyone 's taste as the story moves briskly
1,the plot involves the characters of the original,the movie was just stupid and pointless
1,the story is n't a comedy either,the director of photography and film are the
1,first off i was just thinking that was the worst movie he could possibly have made,first of the movie is about four young women who are in the town trying their home
1,tears in hand is just another film,tears are flying into its ear
1,whatever you may have seen in a,whatever it did i had expected
1,the plot is that of two people who come to be the same as,the story has been told more than the novel that is being told
1,i was looking forward to seeing this film for a first time in the summer,i do n't understand why he is n't doing the same but he could do that
1,mary pickford has a small supporting cast including the fact that it looks like an oversized version,mary has become a great actress but who i have n't seen in her career in an equally
1,basically that 's not enough for you,basically the movie is really quite interesting
1,he 's a pretty bad guy,he 's a bad actor but his
1,it has so many flaws that i cannot understand why anyone would ever have to spend a cent of a film trying desperately,it 's not a good film as it would have been if there were some of the characters played by other actors in it
1,for some reason or other i do not have,for a movie like that should be avoided
1,the acting was very bad though it 's not a bad performance,the movie was also shot in the seventies in canada and has to
1,i do n't care what they call it but i 've,i really wanted something more like this in my opinion
1,there 's only a good chance to watch this movie in a theater in the late seventies,there is a very strong sense for the film the performances by all of these actors the performances
1,the only redeeming feature of the film were its parts of one the music,the movie is about the journey that is used to take a place through the
1,i do not understand how they could ever be the main actors,i am a fan and not a hollywood tv movie buff
1,werdegast was a young man who had been sent to,werdegast was n't the worst actor ever on film
1,did the writers just have to use a word to make the point,did i mention the plot of this film that has a plot
1,so much for those of us who have not yet seen the movie and i did n't know what to do,so the film makes you wonder if the writers and director had made a mistake because of the fact that the movie
1,as if it were n't bad by then you might have seen the movie,as soon the story unfolds is more of a drama than what happens when the
1,it 's very difficult to see how someone would react to a character like this,it 's hard to believe that they did make these actors in the movie
1,i have a soft spot for the first hour and so it,i could watch this movie without wincing at anything remotely profound
1,each time he plays a role he 's in the audience 's imagination,each story features a wonderful and complex story as well as the usual suspects
1,it seems a little rushed at least for a while in an attempt to do so but is in,it is a movie with a few twists and turns but nothing has any of the story lines
1,but the director 's cut above the obvious material was n't enough to,but this is a very enjoyable movie with a bit more depth
1,it 's a film you will not only see in your,it 's hard to see this a movie so long
1,i was not disappointed with the first one,i have not yet seen a film of such
1,how many times i have heard that,how did anyone else make out
1,overall this is one that you should miss,overall the best part for the young lady
1,as the film continues it becomes increasingly clear from there until we,as such it has no redeeming features whatsoever in the story
1,ian holm has a cameo as an aging doctor and a guy in a bar,ian mcshane does very few films as a character but his performance as a villain in
1,then you have a recipe for that,then there are some parts that just make
1,i saw this movie yesterday and it made the film look more realistic,i 've read the synopsis about this show because i do n't like the
1,spoilers the show is about the family of three families who are a married couple,spoilers the first two of them are a bit much but not really bad
1,and if you have n't seen it it is probably,and why is the movie so good to me
1,the story is a great idea the acting is superb and the story makes this game a good movie,the characters are very well acted the story line is strong and it is hard to understand what 's happening
1,the main characters are really bad at least in the end and i mean it,the director must have had more money if you were a little less interested
1,choices are a bit confusing as it tries to cram too many genres into their own way,choices are not enough and i do n't think anyone else is safe or who has to choose
1,thankfully i did see this movie for what it had in store for,thankfully we get one joke about the film and the story line
1,i 've heard this film was on the verge from the video tape as some sort,i 've never seen a movie where people like this would have to be the worst movie
1,it 's like she was just trying to get some information,it has a great cast good script and interesting performances
1,they do the same thing and they are all,they 're supposed to be the dumbest ones out ever
1,thanks not for the poor acting but to make for a nice evening,thanks for the dvd of his latest release the original cut out the film
1,you 'd think that would 've been a good idea,you can really see him being able for a big time
1,to sum things that i did n't like,to sum it all up is that you 're
1,according with all the other posters it was a movie about how he got funding and his knowledge of the law he made the,according a director 's career in this regard this film is simply one that will never end and that is n't even good
1,it 's a bit of an excuse to see this movie and just let your friend do the math,it 's not worth mentioning that it 's not even the best film it has been produced and even with
1,i ca n't believe this was released in the year 2000,i could have spent a lot of effort on it
1,he has a few moments where he meets her a lot,he should 've known it as the ultimate worst film i 've
1,on a technical scale he was n't that great in the first movie,on this occasion it appears that the director had no knowledge what he is
1,it has the same feeling i remember,it 's just that the producers were trying
1,his best friend is a very funny one but i never understood he could be,his father and daughter were a group of children and their friends and children
1,the story of a girl from life,the script and direction are superb
1,why does he just kill him,why is n't a parody on a
1,finally it 's a pretty good movie as is some parts of it but there seems,finally when it 's on a dvd i found it to really be a movie
1,i was surprised by the movie 's title it had a very good message,i had read my comments on this website that i would rather have a medal
1,i do n't like how the filmmakers seem very bored with the concept of the film and the idea of,i could see that the writers did n't know what a real person was and what they were using
1,i think that is a shame since the film is so slow that it has nothing,i have not read any of the books nor do i have to say this but i
1,mistress and daughter are the very antithesis of a film that is as,mistress of course is probably the worst movie in years to come
1,the first half of it is very interesting,the only good part in this movie
1,i do n't know why you did not like it,i have never read the novel before that this movie is
1,william holden is great as his wife but is not the right word for this,william baldwin is the master who is n't quite as menacing as he was before in
1,she has a few of the worst acting talent,she was a huge part in the book
1,meanwhile the real murderer is kidnapped by a mysterious man whom the film 's plot keeps in mind about a serial killer whose only friend is a woman,meanwhile the film starts at some points when the two protagonists are separated from the woods to an isolated church which is a bit of an extraterrestrial
1,the movie starts as a series of events that is more complex in the film,the story is about one man who is in a wheelchair where the family lives his
1,steven berkoff and john cassavetes are in this film as in their roles,steven mackintosh makes a big deal with the film as an aging woman who
1,the story and setting up at the end as the characters have an insidious climax in this,the movie is just about as boring as it gets and it 's pretty well done
1,the only reason i watched the movie was because the acting was very bad,the only other character who could have been a bit more believable is the character
1,what a load of crap it has a very,what a waste of the talent it was
1,i saw this movie at the 2005 film festival and,i do not want anyone else to watch it
1,during one of the scenes with a guy he is talking to the camera and that says a lot to me he says something you,during this time we saw how the movie was made and the use of a few extra names and was very very very good
1,the movie is a bit like a comedy from the first of its low budget,the story was a total washout the story line was predictable and it was a real
1,luke goss has a pretty funny line that he is n't just funny and i think he 's just right,luke wilson plays a reporter who 's obsessed to get his wife on the money and has a boyfriend who is
1,the story is very good but in the end it just does n't matter to us how to do so,the story revolves around the relationship between a group of characters who are not afraid to make things together as they
1,i saw it at the san francisco film fest film festival with friends and i went to see this,i could n't imagine how the producers of this movie got it out on dvd so i 'd buy the
1,the script is very good the characters were very likable and all the story seemed real,the movie also has a lot to live up with and is very good for a rainy
1,yes the music is not that bad but the plot is a little weak,yes it is a comedy about a guy with an ugly mustache and a bad
1,however it 's not the typical film that you 'd be expecting but,however the fact that it 's in the end is pretty good
1,and i do hope that a movie like that gets a,and then there 's the final fight between the two
1,it has its flaws but it never is,it was the best tv series ever
1,sure the plot is pretty bad but it is n't that bad to start with it just did n't do,sure there are a few moments but nothing in which this film can be classified as being too boring
1,the characters are very strong and interesting but,the film is set in new york
1,one of the best performances i 've come to date from a major star,one of the great films is a very interesting and very wellacted portrayal of the
1,every single aspect has a different meaning that a film of could 've but it does it perfectly to the extent of the plot,every film that 's made during the time period in the world of a movie like that is not to mention the way this film
1,so much time devoted and much more,so what we have is a rather tedious
1,in my eyes i would recommend this as a great movie that you have to watch,in the end they did n't have to make it like it 's because the plot was
1,by now i 've seen a film that has made me want some more money and it had a much better job,by the end of the film there is a feeling as if the director is trying to tell the audience what happens
1,but it 's very hard to believe they 've just lost his mind in the first movie and is just a big joke to get,but he does have a good voice and a few actors that is n't just the same actor as he did with the film
1,i just saw this movie at the montreal toronto film festival,i had a good time in my life and i was so
1,samantha dee has a wonderful cameo in a film and i liked,samantha morton in a supporting role plays a young married couple
1,those people who saw this movie would be surprised to see,those of the cast are the best ever in cinema
1,this movie has many twists and turns,this was a bad bad show
1,the main character in an american dream comes in his father to hunt the town of the people by giving the audience to the audience,the film has one of those elements where the actors make themselves look like they had a chance to play and some of them were so
1,in fact i would say it would be as bad a movie,in fact the whole cast is fine but not the best
1,the director of the book is really a very,the script is terrible the acting is awful
1,it 's not as good and well,it is a very entertaining movie
1,i was surprised with all the other people on here saying about the movie and,i was impressed with a series of scenes that i had n't seen before
1,and i think it will probably be remembered,and of course that was not enough
1,this is the story about a young man named sasha a man in a haunted mansion,this may not have worked at the time of it was shown with a little too much
1,well maybe i was expecting a lot more than this but i guess that 's ok because it is not a movie it has to be one of my alltime,well i can understand how the people that made it a really low score for the original and i know the story of the first movie was not good
1,for those who do n't have n't seen it in the theater it will not disappoint me since it 's on the dvd,for those who do n't want to be entertained by this film in a way that the people involved in the making of this
1,which means that this is a great film,which is to me the most important part to
1,is that the only one in the,is that what this movie is
1,unfortunately it 's not a movie and the acting,unfortunately it 's not really easy to predict if it
1,the only thing that 's worth mentioning is the title,the acting was very well put together to get a lot
1,when he goes to a club he goes to his car to get a,when it 's all over the place was a dream of a movie
1,my only criticism that most people here are the only negative reviews of this movie,my only complaint is the lack of any sense and sensibility as a child
1,what i did n't know is that i wanted to give this movie a shot but in,what really bothered is that it was so popular from hollywood to make it to dvd
1,but then they have to do something to make this film interesting and they 're all the same as to satirize their children who are just trying at a certain level in time to get their hands on,but if there 's a point to the movie and its message and some good acting and its funny it 's that it is so funny it actually makes you feel like it should have lasted longer
1,as usual with the movie that 's about it it 's just plain,as a kid you have n't been able to watch this show
1,the ending was great but the rest of you really wanted,the plot was n't bad and the acting was awful
1,my friend said and he loved it,my favorite scene is where the hero was
1,i was really amazed by this film and the way the actors seemed to act,i was not really surprised by the movie because it was n't the original
1,if the writer had given you an opportunity at the end of his career that,if it had been for a good movie it might have been an improvement
1,it 's like watching a film in your life,it 's very funny to see the two of them
1,it does n't work and its hard to follow,it has a story that i thought was quite good
1,we also get more information on their relationship,we have n't had enough of that
1,the acting as well is a total disaster,the movie is filled with great characters and situations
1,again the film starts as it begins to,again i would rate it a 1
1,i would n't even want it as a rental,i ca n't help thinking of the film that has
1,on the other hand you can do that in order for the movie to get even better with a lot of good and funny,on top it 's the first and foremost that is so bad that it is almost impossible to believe it is being done
1,for me this is not all bad,for all its flaws i think its the
1,hands off to the actors involved in all the,hands up the first of the long series
1,which was a really nice idea,which is a pity as a whole
1,then we 're forced to feel in the background that it 's,then it all starts to take us to an early end
1,some of her other films do shine in her and i suspect the producers would take this as one thing to have,some people may not be very entertained by the ending but i would like to know exactly what happened to him
1,the movie is not a good one to watch as an avid movie like the one it depicts the,the only way to enjoy this movie is to the very good use in all it 's available
1,i just finished seeing that movie and the second one was a good surprise because the music was,i do n't want this one to be good but the one that it 's the best
1,i ca n't stand it as a great classic,i ca n't imagine a man who has seen him
1,this is the third movie to make you feel good after the first half hour,this is a wonderful film to show the story of the real life in the lives
1,this film was the first of a series in,this is a movie i ca least remember
1,sirk 's film was a good idea and one of,sirk 's film takes the film out too seriously
1,they make it to his son 's funeral that he has no intention of seeing her and he 's,they 've made a few mistakes but they are so bad they 're good i like the movie
1,it 's not a movie where you will,it just was n't funny to me
1,he does so because he 's not just a kid it 's a,he does n't try anything and does n't have any of it
1,of course the movie is about a boy in the wrong light of an abusive mental illness that is neither of these people really cared about,of all of the other reviewers i 've read here that this is a great series of events that make up for what it is a real
1,the movie 's plot is a complete ripoff with a story about a young woman who lives in the city and,the story was pretty thin and unbelievable the dialogue is lame and there is absolutely no mention of the plot
1,12 out there and i ca because this,12 years have passed for eight minutes
1,spoilers ahead there is a lot less than i expected,spoilers ahead it 's not a movie with a few twists
1,can a movie about a guy and his team have an obsession,can someone please let my own father die please do n't listen to
1,during this period we see her in a young man 's face,during his initial encounter in the movie it was clear that this was
1,i really did n't know i was,i love all of the movies
1,or maybe a bit more of a film than an exercise,or is that just me or is that the point
1,for instance the scene in which the young boy 's sister is kidnapped and the woman is lying in the bed is the most poignant sequence which is actually quite touching if there 's an explicit,for the most obvious of a good hour or two it is hard to take my own time to see it in your movie theatre as it has been described as a piece of crap
1,romero and his wife frank are trying the next two things to get on and the fact is that the only two remaining guys who have come to mind in this film are,romero 's original film proved that this movie is based upon a true story of a young boy who has the mental capacity to live and be in love with his mother
1,i saw this movie on the sundance movie channel and was amazed how good the film was,i have to admit that i am so glad that i'm not one but rather the same type
1,he does it in a way,he was also in my opinion of
1,see a lot and a good movie,see if that was n't enough
1,the acting is poor and there is barely any suspense or scares in it whatsoever,the director and his wife have an opportunity for a film to get the benefit and
1,one of the most memorable movies ever,one is a young man who wants to
1,his best film work is by the great escape from which he appears but he has,his son was the only character that he seemed to have met in real life
1,happy to think the people who made this movie were very good in the end because they do,happy me is the worst movie i can think is the worst thing i have ever seen
1,also a movie like it comes out in the open of my mind,also starring the excellent barbara steele the man who has played her and was
1,it 's not a movie in any sense,it is a movie about a group who had
1,i had to watch it to find more,i ca n't believe that i actually read a
1,there seems like a bunch of really dumb things going on,there 's a lot of blood and it 's also funny to
1,these include the best and funniest of the entire series and they are the best ones in recent tv movies,these two men are not as strong as they were in the real life but they were very good
1,as for me there are some very memorable moments and a touching twist in the finale that will leave you,as for any other movie i 've seen the director 's cut has been used for his previous work
1,i do not have my opinion but i will give it to my friends and i did,i did n't even think they was to die because it 's not a bad film
1,japan was a good idea for an intelligent,japan had a chance to get rid
1,yes the movie looks like something made from an old hollywood studio and with the exception they have to make it look like the director is,yes there may have are some very funny bits but it could n't be any better just to illustrate that the characters were not developed
1,after seeing this show i was hooked by how much i did n't really know anything of the show until the end,after all we get the impression that he is not only a very wealthy young man but a good family guy who is
1,in the first two minutes we learn of each other and to find out what happens to him in the beginning the two survivors of this relationship are killed off with each shot in a strange manner,in the movie it becomes evident in the way a horror movie like this should be taken to a whole level but then there 's the main plot and the fact being that they are the ones who
1,it has absolutely nothing going it is funny or even funny,it 's very difficult to describe whether i saw her as being
1,with a very nice plot and good actors you will see a lot,with his mother and dad he has to be a good father
1,this is a very good movie,this is a film that is really
1,and i 've never watched much of the movie,and the ending is a bit of fun
1,the story was weak to say there was too much swearing there is absolutely a bit,the story is n't very original or even entertaining but it 's a real letdown
1,wooing them are a mix between the 2 and the three protagonists are a married couple who have had a conversation with each others,wooing the two boys who are in this film the plot seems to go out of their hands even the young people that do n't
1,they have a big fat house where the bad girl is just,they make the same mistakes as in this game of course
1,congratulations for the acting the directing of the movie,congratulations to the actors for making it work
1,we are supposed that they do n't have a whole lot of time and time and time,we had the exact idea of a serial killer who had n't seen much since he 's so
1,the story is about a serial killer who has a daughter in a different place in,the main character has a tendency that is supposed and to have a normal boy
1,and if the movie had a little to say it,and the rest of this movie is just crap
1,finally a movie about the holocaust and the world the real human beings and all the people that have made their mark,finally after seeing this film i felt i was seeing a lot more of a woman in the early stages than the original
1,unfortunately this does not make any movie worth watching,unfortunately this is the most disappointing piece of crap i
1,the only redeeming feature that i can think of it,the story is so predictable that it becomes unbelievable
1,the movie is so bad that it,the acting is pretty good too
1,it is one of those movies where,it 's a very bad movie
1,i was able to attend the first,i would give up the chance
1,this movie has an excellent cast and it 's great entertainment from the creators of this one to their work,this was made in the wake of one or another of several movies with the exception that they have made the
1,dorothy carroll who plays emma and does a very fine,dorothy russell gives the best performance of the movie
1,i really do enjoy the film and i do n't believe in a positive rating but it 's a,i just wish they 'd make a sequel but then let me put it down the next day
1,by the time she got into the movie i could not care less,by all of the two categories that were already a good idea to start
1,even with its weaknesses and some more technical details it,even the movie itself seems like a big hit
1,i thought this was going down hill,i do think a lot but i was
1,the story of her son is as,the story is a good one
1,the movie is not funny either it is a comedy and only as a movie it 's definitely not a joke but it does show how it could go into a movie,the film starts to drag slowly and slowly after the opening scene of the opening shot in which the viewer can see a giant lizard devour the camera as well as a shot
1,i did not know the story i wanted a more exciting but,i love the idea of how a movie can be bad
1,if you like to see a very low budget horror movie with a decent storyline,if you watch it and can only laugh yourself into this movie it just did n't
1,it 's really worth seeing and it 's,it 's just so funny to watch
1,he is just in a way of showing a bad side and his anger,he 's always been able but the real reason why you should be interested
1,sadly it seems that the writers did n't even have to make a convincing movie like it was in it and made no sense,sadly he is never convinced of his own and thus it will seem that he is unable to find his way to his father
1,it has all the elements of a hollywood tv show that makes me think the,it is not a movie about it but it will leave you feeling confused
1,this film is about a woman whose mother has been killed,this movie is the exact opposite of what 's going on in
1,i think the whole idea as to what it was meant at that time was a good thing,i was also surprised by the fact he was one that was so funny in the first
1,which is why i liked the movie,which is a shame because the movie was
1,could they have done more in this movie,could they not be the slightest bit of a
1,steals the movie and get into it,steals a dvd of the movie
1,it is a movie of some sort and a little too serious at times but it 's not so bad it,it is hard enough but it 's still a very entertaining piece of cinema making for a very strong plot
1,matt damon does a decent job with her,matt damon is perfect in this movie
1,i would never want to see this film again it just did n't work as well,i just wish they would make a movie like this with a budget that should have stayed
1,the main problem with this movie is the music and sound,the characters seem more like caricatures of people being stalked by a
1,he just keeps making sense and that is a rare thing of course that is how,he is a fine person as well but not that much like the real human
1,to me this is a film that is not only one of the most visually beautiful thrillers of the 1930s but an extremely entertaining film which is definitely not a bad idea to begin it 's not a good,to be honest there are a lot of good things wrong there are no special features there are not a single bad thing in it except the bad dubbing that has been given the actors in the movie
1,for the most part the movie is very slow paced and the movie is,for a change the entire world of the movie is a great one
1,silberling was also a huge disappointment when i was n't,silberling is one that seems not a good film
1,the film has a very low quality but the plot is n't too,the ending is n't exactly a whole lotta things i do think
1,and why does the girl have to go into the basement and get her out of a car to get her,and the final scenes were so bad that the scene that was shot was a waste of time it was a nice
1,she did not have such a bad time in,she plays it for all the wrong reason
1,for one thing i think they must be on board for a few,for example the entire production should have gone somewhere the first day
1,he 's a master of the universe to have a very unique life which was not,he is very very funny and quite funny with a lot more laughs than usual
1,besides the fact of me when they 're a little less funny and they are funny in every aspect,besides the lack this movie is an excellent achievement on any level but i have never been a fan so
1,the story is set against a backdrop of the famous,the actors who played the movie were really good
1,i did not see this at the cinema but it is n't,i have n't laughed my head off of the film but still in
1,from the very start of the film,from the beginning there is a lot more
1,i would have preferred to know more and most people who were in a coma but the one that kept them awake from the beginning that they had never actually seen the movie,i would give this film 8 stars out of 10 because it is so low budget with it that it looks like the movie was shot at the very least a time period
1,this movie was just plain bad and not,this is one of a kind movie
1,had to endure a movie about a woman and the mother in the movie they were the best i 've got,had a lot more to do and was n't so much of a disappointment as the film is supposed and it is
1,while they do n't seem to come together as the story itself they are very real and believable and i do,while i do n't think i laughed the whole time i found myself wondering just why these movies would appeal
1,because the character of billy is a great actor who is a talented performer or is,because when the film came out the film was made up to a new level
1,token and stupid and stupid the movie makes you want your kids to,token and dumber in comparison to the rest of its other ilk
1,the script was n't exactly bad,the story is very simple and very
1,carrey plays a cop who comes to the aid of an evil murderer who has killed the devil and,carrey 's portrayal of the movie is very interesting and very realistic even when the hero was revealed
1,i was surprised when this film came along,i was n't able in a bad movie to
1,one of the funniest things about this film are its characters,one could say that the story is n't that stupid but you
1,despite this is the same film as a little different movie but with a plot that is not too confusing and so is the,despite being a great piece in the history of the war and the great war of the worlds i have seen much worse
1,generally i felt that this movie was just,generally it 's not as bad either
1,i ca n't stand it so much though,i 've seen many other movies in my life
1,aside for this film in a nutshell is a very good film with a,aside from that there are a lot of bad movies in that genre
1,gail and sam have the best in the world because of a love affair,gail and alice have some really great scenes and a couple of moments that make
1,then the movie started abruptly off and the end credits have changed,then she tells a little about the past but she gets involved in
1,they have a great deal of humor in them and they are not too much of the comedy bits the story is very touching and the actors have a good chemistry,they are both excellent and their respective personalities are great for the rest and the film does n't have the same exact impact as the first one but that 's a bit
1,all i can say about this film was the acting,all the performances from that of the movie were pretty well
1,slash and the devil is one movie which was shot in new,slash 's father is an excellent and very talented character actor
1,ah there really is n't much that could have been said in this flick as if it were a spoof,ah well worth your time unless your a masochist or the mst3k fan and do get into the movie
1,the only positive thing about a tv series is that it is n't,the director 's intent of trying is the one to take over and the
1,the story itself was ok as was the case,the script also makes a very good movie
1,the film is a perfect example of how to,the acting the movie is really quite entertaining
1,the plot is a joke the acting is atrocious and at times hard just like the director and the characters are a little dull,the film is very enjoyable and it is a movie for people who like good movies like this i do n't know what this would
1,he is also a master of his craft and he gives the film a very realistic,he is so stupid the other actor he 's just in line with the camera
1,after the film 's final screening the film would have been much better,after the first hour of a movie it was just a waste
1,the plot is simple but the acting direction and the special effects are so,the acting is awful in most parts of her acting in the past
1,this is a good movie in that regard but if only it is not so well paced and written and has a very satisfying performance from denzel washington and,this film has a wonderful cast and a story like it involves a bunch of girls who have to find and get together in a new orleans area
1,the actors in this film are n't great at the end of the day,the plot of this movie was not only based off a book of the book
1,however the fact that the main character and her entourage were so real in the first place would have been nice,however there is still a lot of the same in my mind this is a good film and that 's all i
1,and in the end he 's in a coma and he 's the son who had no clue who he was,and it 's a really poor excuse to bring this movie in the bottom 100 list of the 90 min
1,he was supposed as a child but he was still a lot of people in,he was a great director but he could n't handle it without being pretentious
1,in the original he does a better interpretation with his character 's character in the original,in that regard this would have a field of success and it 's a total embarrassment to
1,for those who have n't seen much of this movie this is an excellent movie and one thing it really is,for instance after seeing this movie you ca n't help wondering what the real deal is or that the film was going
1,thankfully this movie has some bad actors but the rest of the cast does n't work as such,thankfully this is the second film which was made with the intention to attract the public 's throat
1,to add insult to injury i would have rated this movie a 1 out better,to sum up my brain the two leads the real hero who has some great moments
1,gabby combs is the only reason i wanted the entire cast,gabby hayes is the standout as the movie is not as big
1,nobody seems to be a very human,nobody else has been a little likable and
1,but for those that have never read the book i think this was not a good movie because it was written on the basis that,but i could n't take my eyes on him in such a scene that i did find his character to be a total bore
1,what i find in this film has been the easiest work of a career of art film maker,what was more disappointing was that at the outset i had seen the two and that is how i
1,the plot was a pretty lame idea but not a good thing,the acting is excellent with voight who was a great comedian
1,just because they want you have no idea about what happened in the first few moments it seemed like,just a bunch of people who are just in love and not care and do their own thing
1,after seeing a little of a series in the early 90 other i thought that it would have been a lot more enjoyable,after i heard about that i was a little confused by the story and the movie but it seemed that the movie made some
1,after a series about the dangers of a child 's obsession with this one i wondered whether what happened in the last 20 seasons,after the opening scenes of the film there is something of a mystery that the audience feels for a little girl who plays the part
1,and for a very good and interesting,and that 's a great deal
1,tarzan also appears in this story and the two have two separate tasks,tarzan and robin the impotent man from the future has sworn all he has
1,the story is not that great but the film is well executed,the story is simple a real human and one of the most powerful
1,this movie is quite funny and funny but it makes no difference it 's not that good but rather a good movie,this movie is a must see and the most beautiful aspect of the movie has to be one who is willing to choose
1,boorman has managed to make a very unique film about what is happening at work in the late 1960s,boorman 's adaptation was based on his own experiences about the plight and his inability of the human condition by
1,he is a complete dimwit of this type,he 's always on a mission to save the
1,this is the first of a string of westerns that will be released today,this is a terrible attempt to capitalize on real world groups that are now regarded
1,in the end it does not feel like a movie for anyone else,in some scenes the film is a total embarrassment to all audiences who will
1,i have to say this is a very nice experience,i was n't really expecting much from this film but i
1,she 's just one step forward,she meets a group that will leave
1,this is one of those films which is just a waste for,this film is a disgrace to the rule of its audience
1,eventually the film has some great moments in it,eventually she meets an accident and is taken off with
1,the plot of the story does n't help much,the film is also very very funny and very well
1,in other scenes we learn how to be a real horror movie,in that regard i have seen better work on a regular basis
1,his acting is n't all that interesting,his character in the movie is as always
1,oh and it is a good movie if you like that kind of thing the only reason you want to see movies of,oh no that has the power and creativity to make a great movie and it 's not the best it can have
1,almost everything else was the script was bad with all of the dialogue in the book,almost as bad an ensemble actor in this as he 's in this film that it was
1,do not waste your money on this movie,do n't bother unless your looking out of a
1,a few minutes later the director tells the tale about what happens to the man and,a woman named sosuke who is also a servant in the village as a lover
1,cherry has done the job in the film,cherry is in trouble to take revenge on his
1,yep i am not the first to be the same,yep there are moments that are very interesting and well done
1,for those of us from us who have nothing else to watch this movie just is n't that funny,for some reason that does have the same effect of that it 's a parody of a show
1,being a huge horror fan i was expecting a great film with lots of nudity for the sake of getting this,being raised in a remote village of his family has the same kind and the same way that she played in other
1,if you 're looking to have a movie with a lot of gore and,if the film is true the movie is set in a new england
1,it was n't just the first part of what had to,it is not for everyone who loves horror and action
1,when that 's a problem i was n't sure about the movie,when i say the movie is a complete ripoff of the first film
1,making it to the top of the pile and it just seemed to me to be a complete rip,making it through this story is that we all see the same side as the main protagonist is
1,backed up with the likes of the worst of all the movies i have ever seen the movie is very enjoyable and i 've seen,backed by a very simple movie by john carradine a woman that 's being threatened and taken over a woman who kills her lover
1,as the first reviewer said about the film i was very disappointed to see the preview at imdb,as for the plot itself the acting was not as strong and the acting is just too wooden at
1,then the plot is so ridiculous,then it starts with a little girl
1,poetic license to the world of horror film and a great director,poetic license to the center and for this film 's two men
1,at first verhoeven 's films are generally the same,at the start of his day 's career he decides
1,disney 's movie has all the ingredients that make a film such a,disney 's the film has made me want my own money back
1,i thought that the movie was ok with all the actors and the director was obviously going from one,i think i would like to think that the audience must be a little disappointed in a movie
1,the film has an odd sense of humor but it has no plot,the only good acting in this movie is the actor he has done
1,one would have to wonder whether it 's a comedy or even some of those other movies are the ones they make in iowa but it 's really the first one i 've seen so i do hope to find them,one scene is not so great but the fact that it 's not long after its interminable opening scene is so beautifully edited as it 's not even that exciting or suspenseful which would seem unnecessary for a horror film
1,each is the only reason to watch a feature movie,each of the actors is a very funny character
1,fidelity between the two leads with the same theme and the same old lady,fidelity of a child 's play in that she has been in for some severe
1,when the bad guy says to you he is n't even funny at all,when the film ends is a movie that is really a little hard to swallow
1,i saw this film for 5 reasons but i was impressed by the,i was also impressed to discover that it was a major mistake
1,at last they 're just plain silly,at his own time when he sees the
1,i love the first two seasons but as i watched this series i was,i have seen this and is so stoked to watch it every time
1,the movie is a complete waste,the only reason why i gave this
1,horror is the perfect choice to make an appearance in this movie,horror fans and horror fans will see this one and if it would
1,in my mind the only film that was made to be released is the one where the film is shown by people who do n't have to be a bit,in fact she 's a little bit of the tomboy she is given no chance but she does n't have the skills to pull out a gun to cover
1,by all accounts the film is pretty good,by the end of the movie there are two
1,so i think everyone that is a good horror fan should find this film offensive or something like the book it lacks in its plot,so when a stranger is killed the hero turns into a monster which is a bit weird as hell and that 's pretty darn bad because
1,the script is not as good and some of those are the,the film 's soundtrack also does not feature too many things
1,1981 's music is a real treat,1981 is a very good show
1,i had never heard of this film before,i am a big believer on tv show and
1,ca n't you get to the end of this movie where you do know that all the heterosexual men get eaten off,ca every time i see this film i will just be looking for a copy of a copy of the song
1,if i could i have to make something worse,if anyone who has ever read a book knows how
1,the story itself was great and i love this one too,the only thing that was so bad was that the script was
1,it 's just another story that should never be made into an adaptation but it is definitely not worth wasting,it 's almost as though the writer decided to make a psychological psychological experiment and that is what makes this picture
1,the acting is superb all round and the film has a wonderful and interesting look,the director tries the same but with so many clichs that are n't there that it
1,i am a huge hollywood movie fan and i was looking for it on tv,i have been looking for something of the same ilk in my collection for several years
1,what was more interesting however is how closely,what can i do with this movie
1,the script which is not so well written is wellwritten,the acting was horrible the plot was lame but the writing
1,in other words i thought it would get more interesting as,in the end i would have preferred a lot more
1,but this is just another one of those movies that i have n't yet seen before,but what can be said when it is said to be the greatest movie ever
1,to be fair the only negative comments to come out are the performances of both the characters,to me the best part is that this is one of the greatest shows ever made
1,if the film is about the man of the dead i suggest going to,if one does not care about it the film is a good thing
1,the film was made for tv so that 's why i have n't rented that many,the story itself was great but the actors did not work as well it did n't even
1,that 's why i love it,that is the main attraction to the
1,but the film does n't let go and make it very boring,but then he is not in the frame for an entire hour
1,but if you like the first half,but the script is too much
1,and the movie is quite funny though it fails to deliver the punch out,and if you 're not going a movie for it is not for you
1,william holden 's character is a caricature of,william shatner is not a bad guy
1,this movie is a real treasure,this is one of several movies to
1,i am not a fan but i thought it 's good to think that people who actually thought this guy was cool,i was surprised the whole family of these people just ca all off my rocker and i 've seen a lot worse movies
1,actually it 's not all as bad as this,actually the ending is quite funny and leaves little room
1,this is my personal opinion of a,this movie is a perfect example
1,sound was a part of the movie i did not like because of,sound editing is so poor in the movie it is n't scary
1,riding giants in the middle of nowhere,riding lessons in the first episode and the
1,as a fan of horror movies i really enjoyed,as it stands there is n't one character
1,oh it was a movie that would,oh my god what a shame
1,the acting is very good but the story never fails to deliver the,the first half hour of the movie is very much too long
1,seeming to be there for one film the film is a,seeming to be a little more than a simple one
1,the film itself was good enough but it also did n't make,the film has no plot and the action is very good
1,i am amazed when i read that the first movie that i thought was so terrible it was so terrible i had to go and see this one to see,i have n't even been to israel and i have seen this movie so many times over the course that you 're laughing hard to take up my eyes
1,this movie has no story no plot no real plot,this film made some scenes in it like the first one
1,the main problem of most of this film lies to me,the actors were pretty bad even the actors were bad
1,while at the same moment a little slow the movie drags out and ends up being too predictable,while it may be that the story is a good one this is not really a film about the
1,ridicules for kids i think it could have gone anywhere but it 's still the only thing you would n't have,ridicules but not in a good way as it is in the last 10 years and it is so refreshing
1,as an example the character of the little mermaid is one of the worst horror stories ever,as i said it has a very low budget but there should also not be the best movie
1,nipples is a movie of two,nipples is a movie that could have
1,there are so many things in the story that are n't funny and,there is very much about the movie that you want to see
1,this is not one movie i will never forget,this film is not for its technical message and i
1,the acting was very solid at being very convincing,the movie begins with the first one shot in the
1,this is a great film for all concerned,this movie does n't deserve to make a statement
1,the script of course is pretty simple,the acting could have saved it
1,thank god he gets the money to go ahead and buy the rights to it because it would cost a 10 or even three if it had not been over the top for the 2 hour plus in it it was a 10 for me,thank god this was a sequel to a sequel in which the hero and the lion had the same thing to do but the rest of the cast members have a lot of fun doing their own stunts which make for an engaging film
1,first of all i thought this was one of the finest films that have been filmed in my life,first of all the film was so bad that i was stunned at how horrible and dull they were
1,that 's pretty good and i do n't know what it is,that is the only thing that is not a bad idea
1,at times the characters are very funny and even the chemistry between them is very,at first micheal is a very good film with great cinematography and nice locations
1,in short it 's a good movie for all those who like a lot,in other films you can feel the fear and frustration that they were doing so
1,id do n't get it right now,id love movies like 'the muppet show' and
1,the director and writer had a very difficult relationship about the characters and the story,the characters who are introduced to some are pretty decent for some reason but they 're
1,it 's just not much more about his relationship than a love triangle,it makes me wonder if this is just one of those things that i
1,in fact the whole movie is a collection of flashbacks that do not make it a,in one scene she 's talking about an accident from a guy with a chair
1,really not as bad at a good pace as you 'll ever want to be a,really i thought he was a bit more fun and enjoyable than the previous movie
1,django is a must see movie and a great example that one is an artist who can act for an american woman to be seen as one of,django has a great story a wonderful script good music and great casting in this part and the direction is excellent and the actors are really great
1,you can see what happened in the first place the,you 've got a very strong and entertaining movie
1,but the film is a little too long,but the film was good to see
1,if you want it will entertain your brain off your spine and do n't be misled by a film that will make a point of watching,if you 're into movies and like the original film as one i 'll rate a few of them in one or more than this
1,simply put the acting alone is a very bad performance,simply put it was a movie like it did n't take
1,while they 're on the way to solve his problems he gets his way home and has to take his wife from an auto store to find a place,while a little more than a comedy and as a vehicle to get a grip on the story it does n't seem like it is made up of a lot
1,no wonder she did it because she was very beautiful,no one believes a guy and a woman that is going
1,it is a very good movie,it is a simple film that does
1,this is a movie about a bunch trying to get rid of the world of men,this is the worst movie i have run out so far i have no idea
1,look and feel that i have no problem finding the film so funny in fact it is almost a masterpiece of the original and the whole film,look for it and if you have any luck you will probably love it but i did it to give a good idea of a film
1,among all his films he 's an expert who enjoys playing football games with the usual suspects and in an old movie,among others he and his cronies and the other soldiers go on a journey to find their way to their destination
1,even after the first ten episodes or so they were more likely to be left,even though a very young woman is killed by a ghost the woman is not really
1,then again they just do n't make a good movie anymore but i have n't read the other two,then the guy and mouse team out they are so good the girls are so stupid they do n't even
1,if that is only one of those things that should have happened this movie should have been done as one film,if there is a good performance of her in this film why does anyone want her to play one character in the
1,this is one of those films about the war which is very difficult to understand the world 's finest american,this is a really funny film and a nice addition to what it has to offer and it really draws you
1,under the guidance to produce an epic thriller there is a little more time,under the title it seems that he 's the villain at the wheel
1,although most of the other reviews are positive about it they will still have some of the most interesting lines of dialogue to date,although she does n't even have a personality she 's so ugly and obnoxious in the extreme yet it makes him more sympathetic
1,several actors do n't look good,several of his films with similar themes
1,trivia was it 's only redeeming quality,trivia the movie starts with the two sisters
1,this film is definitely worth watching,this is a very good western and
1,and then it 's all pretty obvious there 's a whole lot more to him than this,and it was the director 's intent that the director 's decision was taken to the extreme
1,in the case of his mother he discovers he will have to be patient by his mother,in this case the film looks like a documentary of some sort of class and a real chore
1,the first half is a great example,the main reason to be able is the
1,nicholas lea is not in it at all,nicholas cage 's character was a bit of a
1,meekly a bunch of other people are killed but not,meekly one of them is in one 's place
1,but there 's some good stuff in the movie and is very watchable,but there 's also a little bit to be honest and funny
1,and in the final analysis the movie is an incredibly,and there were several good movies in the theater
1,notice the great talent this film received,notice to anyone who likes this film or
1,the characters are really believable and the story seems pretty unique,the story is n't really that exciting as most of the other
1,blue is not a good movie but it is not a good movie but it is still good and good enough for,blue eyed and the movie is about a man who has the courage of her life and the two of him
1,definitely there are a few funny scenes and,definitely a little too infrequent for me
1,this is a great film for those who love to have an open mind,this film has some excellent performances from some of her best including her character 's
1,as you might know the story is a real hoot,as for the script i was a little worried about how
1,greedy man is an amazing movie,greedy little hooligans who are trying out
1,the film opens with some nice shots of the city of san francisco,the cast is great the actors playing and the performances are superb
1,there was a lot of things going on,there are so many of these kinds of movies
1,i 've just finished reading the other comments from this movie and i was excited that he could n't find more people and i could handle the story in it 's entirety and that,i have a problem with that because of how i was looking forward to this show it 's a complete waste of my life that i do not invest to get out there
1,lines in the film and some of the best dialogue in movie history,lines were supposed to be funny but this movie is so unfunny that it
1,this is a great documentary and i do not recommend to everyone,this is one of the worst movies i 've watched in a while
1,it is the type that 's supposed and is n't it,it 's all pretty boring and you have the usual formula of
1,and as the credits rolled down my face was a bit of this comment it was obvious that the film itself,and it was n't the best of her career but she also had a lot to do with her character
1,i have been searching so much on my own life,i would rather watch 'the lion king' again then this and
1,1010 for all the actors and a little more,1010 for the music and for what you see
1,he is also a good guy in fact he 's always a joy to see and the rest is a real pleasure,he is one of the most annoying characters of our time but i 've seen him in a lot worse than this
1,i'm sure this would be one of the most boring movies,i'm afraid that they would never have released the script
1,because in this film there was a reason it was in the film for,because the movie does a great disservice for the characters that were made
1,this film should 've been a success,this movie also made no excuses to have
1,after watching this show they can do very well for the first hour,after seeing what they had planned to take on the film the film would
1,he is the hero and he also has a great time of his own,he is an artist with a secret and an understanding of his relationship but he
1,this is not a bad movie and it is not,this is a classic film with a wonderful soundtrack
1,and there are two different actors who would be so far more suited than to be,and that 's exactly what i expected from a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre
1,these are the two leads in the movie who were trying very different,these scenes were cut to a minimum of detail and were forced to make
1,amazing cast with fine talent as good supporting cast who have a great deal to work,amazing to look after you see how many people who have to deal on their own life
1,every actor who plays the main role of david lean is a bit of fun to,every now he is still a great actor but i think i 've seen him
1,arnie is very funny and has a pretty funny scene,arnie is not bad as the villain or the bad guy
1,sane little kids who are looking at the camera and make fun,sane people and a few other people are a little stiff when they
1,presumably the movie fails in every aspect,presumably he 's a great director
1,but the rest of our society had a different resonance to it,but there is a great twist with the final showdown when the girl
1,steven seagal had some nice acting skills,steven bauer stars as a cop and who
1,so they make you wonder when there 's a lot of things wrong,so i think that the story line is not too interesting to the movie
1,the story line was just that bad and so was the script,the movie is a little slow moving and the actors are n't even
1,i have no problem believing that the plot would n't be so great,i think it was n't very bad but it was good fun
1,the ending is a bit cheesy,the plot is quite thin and predictable
1,i love this movie but i have to agree with most of the,i have read several books on several levels of the original novel
1,if you do not believe in him as a child then the whole family,if it 's your choice you ca because we have your fair movie
1,bernard 's father is the perfect embodiment of his dad,bernard is n't an original film that does n't have a
1,it 's a real pity that most of the cast,it is about as subtle as you can get
1,but i was n't impressed at the,but it 's not that bad
1,i would like that film to be able,i have watched this film twice and i think
1,i'm a big scifi star of all of those bad,i'm going to be on the edge of you
1,as i said this is a very poor film that i ca n't believe it is made on a limited level,as a matter of fact the story of the movie is about an aging man who has a heart attack against his
1,not to mention there is no such thing,not a bad movie but it is watchable because
1,while the movie was quite obviously geared at the audience at a time in this case it was the first,while he had the power and soul to be a very funny movie he is still in his element
1,by the time i get to the end of his life his performance was the strongest of the three and the film is n't as bad,by the end you do not see the story at all as you can imagine that of course the film is an important part of a film
1,spoiler ahead we 're talking about our hero,spoiler warning the only redeeming feature that can be
1,he is so much better than his own,he 's the only one of the two
1,it was very good and really liked the first 3 seasons,it had some similarities to this and the film could n't have
1,there was a lot of action in the plot and the fights are pretty much too short,there was no point and the plot was too predictable for the viewer to really care
1,he is a quiet man who has been trying too hard to find a job,he has the best scene of the movie as an old gentleman in this case is
1,the movie is a waste of talent,the acting is excellent the story line and
1,the script and characters are so bad that you 'll never get bored of any,the only redeeming quality of the movie was that it could have been a lot shorter
1,a great cast a very good story and a very solid soundtrack,a movie is not about the subject of the human condition
1,however despite the fact the director 's daughter is no more than the movie she seems to be a bit of a jerk,however the main problem with the first film is the way they used them in a manner where i found this film boring
1,there is no story to be found in this movie the acting is horrible,there were some funny scenes of one liners and the whole film is n't that
1,this is by today 's poor film,this is one of the funniest and most
1,oh and it was made from a studio,oh yeah this is the first time
1,people who like the first movie are not so sure they are n't the best,people who say so much of their work and others can only say the least and
1,he is the first and best actor of this movie to do it,he is a pretty good actor but he could have been better
1,i do wish he would have seen more of him,i do agree with the other reviewer that the movie is
1,i ca n't wait for the dvd release which was made in the uk,i am a huge football fan and have never heard of this before
1,stella is a good character actor as the woman she is played in the movie,stella and ashley are just fine as the lovers but when a group of people find
1,the movie is about one guy who comes from korea and has a job that is very funny and the,the main problem with a film is that the actors are not particularly good and not really very believable
1,they are the ones who get the feeling and that in the case of the movie 's main,they did n't need to do anything so much that they did n't even care about them
1,john cusak is very good as a man that gets out of trouble with his life in a small time in town,john mctiernan wrote a book about the man who was responsible for his work in which a child in a household can live
1,although there is a plot a story that revolves around the characters being stalked with no,although the acting is n't bad i do admire some poor direction of the film
1,it 's about the only one in the cast in new zealand in america,it 's a nice movie to watch and some of the scenes are funny
1,dr and mrs smith is a film with excellent timing and a perfect cast,dr hackenstein has a good heart and it 's not just a good thing he
1,just the whole cast are excellent,just like it is in a lot
1,and the fact that it 's based on actual events made no sense and just plain stupid,and if your a fan that will be at least a good one and a half hour of
1,the film itself looks good and the cast is also wonderful and the movie itself has,the story of the young woman trying to find out the truth about her family
1,brooks' portrayal of a man raised by an eminent woman is not,brooks' character was too sweet it was n't funny at all
1,it 's very hard to believe the audience was n't laughing when they went to the cinema,it is a shame that they are making sequels like the one with the likes of these three
1,exaggerated of a film about an american,exaggerated plot and a ridiculous plot
1,too much screen play by director peter duffell and written by roger hackman who is a big man,too if you want to see some kind of story about relationships with each other then go ahead to
1,a very enjoyable little film with excellent performances by robert taylor robert montgomery and robert deniro,a man is stabbed in an accident and the woman who looks like a baby at night
1,what the hell has it all about it it has to be some of these films which made me jump through my head,what 's worse about this is that it shows the world of this movie with only one single person that makes people feel sick
1,only if you have n't seen a movie this is the film you 'd,only this is the first film you see the trailer for that film
1,it is a classic film and a very,it 's very nice at the beginning
1,the music has to be the worst thing i 've had ever witnessed in my,the ending of the movie was pretty good but it was n't very good
1,the acting was so stiff you could only hear the dialog on screen,the ending is a joke but it is n't so much the truth
1,one day she has a girlfriend and then they take care,one of the best movies of the last ten years
1,of the movie the only thing that kept this film,of course they were all in the wrong hands
1,every time he is at the place you see him sitting down and drinking beer and talking about the scene and his eyes as his character is supposed to look in the basement of his body,every time i watch you know it 's not as deep as in this movie you will feel like the movie is going to be a bad move to a certain extent in this piece of rubbish
1,for example one of his main assets was when he,for fans of the genre this is a must
1,well he 's a man and a woman who could not be sexually ill to get him,well let 's just say there was no way that it was going to be good
1,in short i think the film is a real delight to see,in fact the actors are n't particularly bad at the end but it
1,it 's really a movie to avoid at all,it also has a good deal of plot and plot
1,she also has a few scenes in a scene in which the characters come across very different but that really does happen to this show as it is a,she has made this look great because she can have a great screen presence as a performer in her new world and her acting career is very believable
1,the film is quite slow but still holds up to a certain point of it all,the only positive comment about 'the muppet show' is that it is very slow very slow to
1,this is my first review of this film on my review,this is the kind of movie that should make you laugh
1,sure it is an original movie but it was not,sure the ending may not be true but it 's a
1,i have to admit i love this film,i saw this film in a sneak home and
1,i do like this movie and i,i think the acting is good
1,the only character that is funny to the hilt is who they,the main reason why this movie is so awful and ridiculous
1,tom berenger plays his usual villainous and cynical man with a heart of gold that,tom hanks had the best of his best roles at a very young age
1,the characters all seemed too stupid and,the acting is horrible as well
1,the script and the acting is superb as well as the actors,the story line is not bad just good enough to make up a
1,and why do n't people like her as much else in their relationship or as a good girl,and if that person did any such things as to make sense in the movie he should be
1,this movie is an insult to the intelligence,this is one i do n't want
1,arguably in the beginning of the film a couple of scenes are connected to a classic,arguably the best part of the movie is the way the character development is revealed
1,both of them are in love and they are the ones,both movies do contain good acting but they are horrible
1,and it 's not funny in the least,and i 've seen the same old done in
1,then we see a scene of it 's not in any way,then the film settles into a little slow plodding dull mess
1,apart from a brief scene of the hero that is quite funny the rest i mentioned,apart my friends and i saw the movie last week ago and it was still a very
1,fortunately this was the case with her,fortunately it was a bit too bland for
1,this movie is an example why a man,this film really is for the lovers
1,he was the perfect choice of this film to work on a big screen,he plays a man named krishna singh who has a very strong role
1,jacob has been a great character and he 's never,jacob and his friends are both in their own
1,now there is a lot of movies that are better than this,now the main character is a rich guy who is being hunted in
1,every film has a distinct and intriguing feel to them which they do not get through,every time i watch it on a dvd and it does contain a few funny lines and
1,the acting is poor and the plot is stupid,the only real problem with this flick is that it
1,i thought the film did n't make any sense at,i really wish someone else had a good director
1,nothing really original here is a few things about the film that are,nothing in his life and the plot of an armored car chase
1,the first thing is the special effects were pretty low,the movie is just too depressing for some viewers
1,and it is very difficult for me how the grinch would react to the fact that he 's just a little bit of an idiot,and the other performances of the two are just plain poor but that does the best way better than the rest of the movie
1,it 's not that she 's not a movie queen,it really is a bad movie that 's not even worth
1,however the director must have been trying to cram the film into a movie,however the best scene to me was seeing the young girl being dragged into a
1,westerner is also a complete loser with many options to make his own life,westerner 's wife is so busy at home to get her back and he gets
1,equally well directed and acted and acted well,equally funny is the scene where the three main
1,this was the first movie in my life i would n't want it to be a masterpiece in the,this is n't a movie for you but as a film it could have a very good plot
1,i am not a big fat football player but this was,i ca n't think of anything more positive with it
1,besides a few of the cast the movie goes from decent supporting cast and the director 's wife 's character is a,besides the scene when the kids are dancing with the children the mother and the other daughter are actually really annoying
1,so they decide that she does n't want anyone for money that has a chance of getting the marriage to the police because they are in a position when their own daughter goes to work to find the killer,so if you are in this for a very good time at a place i would like to be sure to have something that you will love but it 's just a lot better than the movie itself
1,he 's also a very talented actor,he was n't the least convincing actor in
1,saw this film as a family in school in,saw this when it was broadcast on tv
1,the film is a complete insult in all departments,the only redeeming feature of the film was the performance
1,actors have proved a great deal for the roles,actors do a better thing than i expected
1,i love this movie in terms,i do not understand why it was
1,and of course there really were n't any other movies that i enjoyed this one but it had a little humor,and if you 're like me the first time you 've ever seen the movie you 're in a different level
1,bogey seems a bit over but in reality it is a shame that she did get back to,bogey 's portrayal of the young man who is n't so much and is not that funny
1,it is the story of a rich young woman who works on a small island of massachusetts in,it could be a good thriller and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies
1,the story is n't very well written,the movie was shot in english
1,this is a terrible movie that was so bad that it was funny,this is n't all that original and i 'll never be bored but i
1,i have never been a person that loves movies,i am so impressed i have to say
1,i do not know if this has been done in a low budget,i did n't think the director could have gotten a better actor
1,certainly i 'd give it an 810 if only for those looking out of the box,certainly it 's all about the film 's appeal but its impact is more than it is
1,so it would get so boring,so if you are going for a
1,i do n't understand why i did n't watch this movie until it got canceled so quickly i decided that i,i would recommend renting this movie if i would like to see it again but it is a good film
1,it 's not a very well written but it 's an enjoyable ride in every aspect,it is a bit like something that 's not funny and not funny at times
1,you 're in for quite a shock if you 're into the old movies,you know it just is n't going to have been released in a very good
1,he had to fight a few weeks but,he 's always been a great actor
1,thus a very good one and that is why i give it a 7,thus the plot of the two towers are as usual and the action is pretty
1,as for the acting in the film the only one who actually managed his lines was the script,as for the rest well i do remember the ending when the main girl in the first movie has
1,the acting is ok but the rest of this movie just sucks,the characters who are so real are just too real and do n't
1,the acting is a little stilted but the story line and acting leave you wondering what kind of film making it has to offer as a good example,the movie does n't get anywhere near the greatness of any of these shows that have been made and the film has all three major parts as well as
1,otherwise if the movie had to have been called an action movie,otherwise the best acting performance is the actress she 's in
1,and it 's not the least interesting,and i have n't seen many of these
1,certainly the funniest of the genre is probably the only drawback that i have seen in the original film,certainly this is the second time in history today but the film is not without its flaws and it does
1,but that 's not all i did n't enjoy it for that the plot was a little weak,but there 's a good chance to do n't try too hard and to be honest and to add
1,leave to the viewer to be a hero,leave for the first part of season 1
1,but that is the only reason why,but this is one film you can watch
1,the music by carter was a nice touch,the only thing that saves this movie is a
1,in fact it seemed like a bad movie,in a nutshell he has a great supporting cast
1,that was the main idea of the movie,that 's when the movie 's first act came
1,let 's take this film seriously it is a real shame of the genre,let me say it 's a bad movie but a lot more then i have
1,why did n't the police get involved in the investigation,why not the fact that these guys are n't going to
1,based off the novel by the same author he plays this,based at the classic novel by arthur k e somerset
1,joan severance has a wonderful performance in this film,joan crawford has a very difficult role playing her character
1,also the movie is just so bad,also it does not make up the bulk
1,maybe if it is n't for the fact of the film it 's worth mentioning the acting,maybe not the best movie out there so it just seemed to drag at the heartstrings
1,connie silverman is a revelation and is a good actress,connie michelle phillips does an amazing job as always but the
1,some say a lot about the film,some of them are very funny and some
1,there 's a very good scene at one where the hero has been killed by one girl from the beginning in,there 's a great cast including a young rooker who works well for his own personal talent for this role
1,the movie is a waste of time,the cast is not too bad
1,at the end you realize that there are n't much of a plot to follow,at some point in this movie he decides that the killer will be dead and he
1,the only thing that could have saved this,the story and characters are not bad
1,he then meets the girl with the doll and her mother and her boyfriend,he has to do a lot more than just trying to bring his teeth back
1,nope do n't get fooled by the film,nope i'm sure this film will be a lot
1,weir has no idea how to take,weir is a very talented filmmaker
1,but then you know who the real culprit are,but what was it about is how the heck would
1,the story is a little too old but it is definitely worth the,the story is simple enough for those who can enjoy the movie
1,it 's very funny as the characters are well developed and believable,it is a very difficult thing to make a good movie and not
1,now the movie is n't really bad enough to be good it was just so boring,now you know they should be the main characters at heart the story unfolds and we feel
1,you are watching the entire episode,you could have done better in a
1,shooting a man is a film about the,shooting for a moment i was watching
1,i'm afraid that it was a movie made in the early 1990s but with a very cheap story,i'm not the only one who is looking into this movie and i really do n't know
1,from the point of it all,from what this is the most beautiful
1,the only real gripe that makes the most famous is that the story 's character is so convoluted that it,the script was a joke at times but there was so very little substance in the first two parts
1,i ca all get a lot less out from him in this,i would give it 0 and that is to be generous
1,it 's not even a comedy or a good film but its just not,it was so awful and i could not even begin to understand it
1,finally the only reason to watch the movie is to find a good movie,finally i would have given it a higher star and a 3 if that
1,i was n't even expecting a film that had a plot like this,i have to admit that i am a big fan and i have n't
1,among other things in a film about life,among other points is that it has n't been
1,i have a feeling that i was watching a parody movie,i had a good time believing that the movie had its moments
1,that may have been a turnoff but the movie was so funny it had its moments,that is a shame because the whole movie is just a dream of the man who has
1,which is one reason why i give this,which i think is the most overrated
1,it 's a movie that 's not about the evils that are so much of a cult as a film it should have stayed,it 's a shame he has n't made more films like this so let 's see that he is not a bad director
1,however that 's not what i 'd call,however the story line is very interesting
1,the story has a similar premise,the movie is also quite touching and
1,david warner 's the best was his first movie and this is the one that made me laugh when,david lynch does an excellent job of playing a character he does n't know much in this movie
1,it 's a very good movie to watch with your family,it is just a movie to get your attention from a true
1,the only real gripe for this movie is the music the soundtrack,the whole movie is about an old man and the boy who is
1,how about it 's a great actor,how many of the movies you can tell
1,just a little too long for the good guys,just do not get me wrong on it
1,to be sure i could be wrong,to those who think that it 's a
1,overall not that big a deal,overall good horror movie making fun
1,i had been interested with seeing this,i ca n't get out enough
1,he is the one to watch with the wife,he is a real man who believes he 's a
1,i 've never been in a movie where i want the same story,i was surprised when this got was a movie with my heart and mind
1,by contrast i am with my coworkers at the time,by doing n't even want the two women to get a
1,the whole plot is just too ridiculous,the only saving grace is the cinematography and
1,despite being an american i found myself wanting the story to be interesting in my memory i think that 's the,despite the fact it was set on a cruise of a low budget production it could have gone with it
1,it 's also a film with no plot or anything,it 's as simple straight off that watching as the wizard
1,while the film is set in ireland the story has some interesting elements that make the story so real so real that it is hard you to care about,while there is some interesting dialogue and the cast is excellent with very little dialogue and little they just never really needed any of them and the only other reason
1,it 's not really a bad movie or is she just a poor actress in the,it is just a shame because he does everything the same could have come with
1,it 's not for everyone it 's not,it 's not as if they were trying to
1,take me to the big house,take the time to get the dvd
1,most people who have n't seen this will probably think that the idea to get it is bad,most definitely not the best film in the works of all but a film made in germany
1,i saw this last night at 3 pm and it was,i am not an expert and that 's a shame
1,i was a young lad and i thought there are two different films to be in my top 20 films but they were made by the same author who used to be made,i had the pleasure of seeing this movie when i saw the original bambi on the cover and it was very good seeing a movie called that it made it look interesting and the
1,during the opening fight scene and a scene which takes a while in the scene of,during the movie there was a brief scene involving the guy on the phone floor
1,however that really really was n't the intention of the movie and the film was pretty funny,however a few times the movie does n't go anywhere fast as you expect a lot of movies
1,the characters just seemed real enough to make the film,the plot is a little confusing and i have to admit
1,he 's also very good in this,he was n't the only actor
1,his performance is so natural that i felt the need for the,his best and most famous is the one he gives away
1,the film is so full of clichs where the acting was so unbelievable so,the first of the two movies is the only similarity to this one
1,i do not recommend to any of any of,i was impressed by the ending of it
1,despite the fact that i could have seen this movie on the big budget it could have been better,despite some flaws and some of the worst acting i have seen this movie goes into the latter category
1,cillian has the perfect idea of the man who wants to make a sequel that,cillian in particular is an awesome film in which it 's filmed on video
1,if the story had such an interesting ending the movie would have worked better,if a good movie like the ones that made the first movie i 'll have
1,the only person who had any interest in,the acting in this film is terrible
1,nothing can do a great film with a decent amount in common,nothing else in this flick is a bit of an adventure
1,do n't watch this if you are an adult,do n't let the cover fool this movie any more
1,poorly written poorly directed badly scripted poorly scripted witless,poorly edited it 's not worth the effort
1,when you 're not a good guy you know how to handle a role and it 's like a bunch,when he is supposed to be gay and the young man he has his own problems in his head
1,the plot is n't really that bad but it has a great deal to tell,the story line was just awful and it was the first hour of the movie to
1,soon she finds out she is a virgin,soon afterwards she gets out of a hospital to
1,nazi and korean were in my opinion one of the worst movies i 've watched,nazi commander is a beautiful little film for those who have to watch the movie to
1,the film is n't a very well done film and it fails miserably with the acting ability of several actors,the film is also an exploration on a subject about a young girl who has become an alcoholic and was quite
1,he was a very gifted actor,he and his friend and their friend
1,i really ca all think about what happened,i do n't think this was a bad idea
1,rotor is no better in terms of storyline,rotor is a film to avoid for those who
1,congrats for all this in this case this is not a masterpiece,congrats to the cast as the cast is pretty much the same with
1,not the greatest film you 've ever seen but it definitely is n't one,not only were they completely indifferent they have no clue they 've done anything for
1,the plot is quite intriguing and the characters are so well defined that when it finally changes to the movie 's final moments its not really worth,the main point for me was that this movie was shot independently and it was not the worst film that this would have made even worse
1,the acting is so poor that it 's a pity to see him perform,the film seems to be a little bit too long to be too slow
1,watch it on a rainy dvd,watch this film if not for the
1,nothing to complain about except that she is n't,nothing in its entirety for a horror film
1,actually this is a very interesting movie,actually the acting was good and the story
1,roger corman 's work and a story about some,roger ebert gives the title a fair amount
1,i did n't think that this was the first,i ca n't wait to see the show
1,one of my best movies and a real stinker,one could easily say there is plenty to admire and
1,we were n't surprised at the lack at all,we get to feel sorry for her the whole thing
1,every scene is set in another house and the other is a big fat black guy,every other aspect in it is fantastic and it really does have some redeeming features
1,john ritter gives a great portrayal of a,john ritter was also a great actor
1,surprisingly enough it 's just a good game for adults,surprisingly i do remember the scene where the hero 's wife
1,they are n't really the same,they were a lot funnier than they
1,so the first thing that really did me in was that it was an interesting and very enjoyable movie that kept my interest and in fact was the only,so many people will find the book to be a bit disappointing and there is no point for making a movie for that long period in their life
1, is probably one of my favorites and it is, is the most interesting thing about the film
1,there was also a scene where the girl gets involved with the girl,there 's an obvious message that will only lead a few of the viewers
1,the director is not interested in making a movie about life,the movie opens out like a bad tv show but it 's
1,however after all he 's a bit of a loner he has the most basic plot to be a real problem and there are many things that really make this film a little bit too good for me to be really disappointed,however it was not a film that was in the middle of the afternoon it is just so boring and you 'll be disappointed if you 've never seen a movie that is so bad that you 'll be compelled to spend time
1,the only redeeming features were that the camera work by the camera was,the script is pretty good even with a lot more action sequences
1,when the film came out of the box that was supposed to be a good adaptation on a,when they do n't know anything about them it 's difficult to believe any more to them
1,will we learn the real world the real world,will the filmmakers learn that this film is not about
1,the music by james horner was a nice surprise to me,the story is simple the characters are stupid but the actors and
1,she is a good woman but she is not a good actress,she has been living a long life since she married a woman in
1,the movie is n't all bad it 's a pretty boring movie and one that fails miserably,the first scene in the movie was a lot like when he was in the movie and that
1,they should have done a really good movie,they should never have done such an excellent job
1,but the most disappointing part of the show is the ending at the last episode,but he does a lot better but the only problem with this movie is the ending
1,passageways and bullets are all over the map,passageways are also supposed and more or less accurately
1,does n't it be that hard for a good actress like her own,does anyone else notice that i am not at one time a bad man
1,it is also very clear and is the most,it 's a great show of a kind
1,and the story line of the movie was interesting,and then the film started with a great ending which
1,made during the first 40 minutes of,made for tv and tv series
1,he 's not funny and i could go out and find his performance,he and the rest is a very nice film it is n't all bad
1,in this movie they really want us to understand them,in the book he makes the most interesting character of his
1,as far as the acting it goes down and,as with the story it 's too hard
1,but that the rest of the film is a mess,but the film 's strength is it in the last few
1,surely the best film that has ever come with a remake,surely the most interesting aspect of it being the use of the
1,samuel l jackson is in it too much in this one that makes you wonder if he 's the,samuel l jackson had a bad supporting cast in a very poor adaption of the classic godzilla story
1,the plot is a little confusing the acting and direction were horrible the plot was terrible,the film takes itself too seriously and its impact has a couple more interesting characters
1,really do n't waste your time you wo like,really i think the film was pretty good
1,it is a shame because he 's no longer a character than the,it 's an attempt to make a real world out of it
1,are you not paying homage to a good film,are people watching it with me and the audience
1,the acting was excellent and the direction was beautiful but it was,the whole idea behind a movie with a lot of action
1,i 've always found something to like,i was n't expecting too much
1,the film has an underlying meaning and its subtleties are almost palpable,the story line is about two people living in a very isolated neighborhood
1,this film was a major letdown,this is a movie with a lot
1,fulci is not at all fond of the original but this one has a real problem with that,fulci 's direction of this film is not even close enough to create a decent atmosphere and it 's
1,the story is based on the novel by the famous writer stephen m anderson who wrote a screenplay that did n't seem to go through much and,the only reason i went into it for me was because my roommate was on a show and it looked like it had a real effect
1,the script is full of bad clichs which make me wonder how many movies,the director should have known it was a comedy instead of a movie
1,the acting was great at times and in the case of the first movie,the only problem is the fact this movie was made to capitalize it
1,it 's a story of two friends and an idealistic woman who is married to him,it 's just a lot of fun and fun and it really does deserve to be seen
1,this is the kind that makes people,this film was a total disappointment
1,poorly acted and poorly done poorly directed edited directed with a capital rating,poorly researched and acted like a movie it would be a dud
1,he is the one person who has a secret and he,he was the first one to be a big star
1,what 's up with that in the film,what was more shocking is how much i enjoyed
1,i have a copy of this film and the film made me laugh cry while i walked and saw it on cable,i think the movie is just a great little film and if you have n't watched it you will love it
1,the movie is a waste of time if only it is available in theaters,the story takes the cake in the story but the movie never really becomes quite
1,these are things that i have never seen on tv,these movies are about this kind but i do not have
1,as a result the film fails to entertain anyone,as for the plot well done well and i must
1,oldboy should of given the credit of the great depression of the day and in that 's what i mean in most of his films,oldboy is the best film in its genre and the most shocking movie ever made and the most impressive of all times in its own life
1,i am in one of those who do n't want to take it as if not the scariest and funniest movie i have watched in a long long time and i have a fondness to anyone that is a fan of the series and the film,i saw many movies in this case but this one takes the cake so much that i have been watching this movie and i am amazed that it would be on dvd for sale in the us at that time and had only heard it as the
1,this was a movie that should have been released straight to dvd,this movie is just pure trash and i'm thankful that many people actually
1,this is by far the most original and unique portrayal the movie has going for him,this movie has a very good cast and i ca all give it a 2
1,this is the funniest movie of all times,this is a really great episode of the classic
1,the first time i saw the film my,the main problem lies in the end
1,the story is not original and it could have easily taken a more simple story and it is too much to be a good movie,the script is a joke of its type and the acting by everyone who has a sense in the movie makes it very believable
1,this movie was an attempt and made an attempt to get a new life and even though his,this movie is not just a movie that makes people feel like an idiot and a person
1,that 's why i loved the movie,that was the only thing i would want
1,of which it should be a good idea for one,of course it has a lot to tell but the director
1,there are no other movies in which the two leads,there 's a big payoff between the two leads
1,the ending is great i 've always liked the movie and i,the script for a new movie is not very good either
1,from here the movie is not bad for a few laughs at first,from all the movies i 've seen this is one of the best
1,it is a film and a good example,it really makes me sad and i have never
1,i had hoped this could happen so soon i had to see some people in high form who looked so different,i think you should check out something else but you need to keep the movie in the first few minutes
1,introductions with the actors and the actors,introductions are often the same old but not
1,with all the usual stereotypes and ideas you should n't be able this show is the best in all its worth seeing,with the help he had to make a movie in the last 20 minutes of the movie he 'd never had any interest
1,but in reality i did not care about it,but if you have a choice and have not you
1,bored me and my wife loved this film and i had a friend,bored with the world the first season of this movie is still the classic
1,heck they 're not the kind of person who wants a good laugh,heck if it was a comedy i would advise a few friends to go
1,and that 's how i was watching this film,and as a result it 's not really that bad
1,those who love musicals should n't miss it and they are just to,those who have commented in the film industry do n't mind it
1,it 's a pretty bad movie with no real plot no tension no character just a little,it just did show how the original movie was in 1968 this was filmed in australia
1,norm is one who gets an idea of her being a woman and tries to help them to get away with it by marrying them,norm macdonald 's direction has improved considerably the most notable character in the entire story the film 's story and acting is uniformly superb
1,she was a young man and her father died in the middle and the first one which i was hoping they would have had to go back for the first movie,she is the best character in this movie so the movie is not for everyone and if they do not make one of these shows i will probably watch it to see
1,sorry for those who are n't looking for a good,sorry i did n't see the movie for me
1,i have to give the movie some credit because it made,i would n't even bother watching a movie like that
1,secondly the characters just seem like the movie makers had been trying hard for the money and made the film a little boring in my book it was boring,secondly the movie is full throttle is a waste of time if your looking at a film like the first time it is the end of the movie
1,the acting is not only great as the movie goes in the film also is n't the main thing in the movie but,the main problem with that i 've noticed from being is that she was the only person she did not care about
1,the only thing i liked is the fact this was made for tv the movie is a little bit of a stretch,the movie is about a group who are trapped at the same time and decide that the only time people would love each
1,there are a few good scenes and the ending is so great,there 's no need of a plot of any importance of the characters
1,released on one disc of dvd and for the most part and the extras of the show i found the show very entertaining at the time,released in the early nineties this is one of the many movies i have seen where he can pull his camera and make a film that is
1,somehow the movie becomes tiresome and pointless and never,somehow i did not expect something like that
1,it is a very dark and depressing experience but it has a good plot line very,it is a bit of a shame to see such bad things as a whole
1,i had n't even laughed so hard at my,i have to wonder what was going on
1,you can tell me what the movie is supposed to be,you could never have done a film with that same person
1,she is the most beautiful and compassionate character,she was an excellent actress for me
1,they even get a chance at the end to give the audience a very good understanding about,they could have made the film more interesting if the story was a bit too much
1,these films were n't all bad films,these are the first movies i 've seen
1,so much time was spent in this movie which could have made a nice movie if it were,so do i do n't get my point back but i think this is a must watch movie
1,stay alive because i thought this movie should be called a cult classic in my mind a film,stay with you i can see you 're all very glad to see it at the bottom
1,as an example of it 's time in my opinion,as the first film i have seen the film with a
1,it was all there were a number of other,it has absolutely no relevance to the original
1,this is a great film for those who love horror movies,this was supposed by a guy who would be very happy with
1,the movie follows the adventures of three teenagers who play,the whole idea of this movie is a joke
1,and why does she never have an affair or her mother,and he is just like the most ardent actor from an old
1,i 've seen it many times but i will say that it 's not the worst of its kind in the history of cinema,i saw this and at the sundance film i had been impressed with the movie 's lack thereof i had to sit with it
1,the film has been so much better than many films that are released but the film 's negatives are n't even the same as the original,the film is about the same thing as the book with the same name attached for that film and it shows how many people go to live
1,he is still very convincing in the role,he 's a master and the only man who
1,my recommendation to you is that you do n't really have a good,my favorite scene is a woman who gets raped by the killer
1,seriously i was very pleasantly surprised with,seriously it 's not very funny
1,when the movie was finished the book is not that good but the actors,when i first saw the movie my brother is going a little overboard
1,the movie was also a big disappointment,the main character is just not convincing
1,top notch actors in this one is the best in my list,top notch acting from all involved in her own acting performance
1,it seems the actors were not the actors to play and the director did n't care about the characters,it is also a nice experience to watch a movie that is so great that it becomes unintentionally funny with
1,music is a little jarring but the story was very weak too,music does n't sound very real but it sure looks like a movie
1,the movie opens up with the same old man talking and talking about his death by using his,the only real redeeming factor to this movie was to show my friends to get the point
1,this is a very bad film and not,this film was released on several viewings
1,everything that happens was pretty good in this movie,everything has to do with a woman whose death never
1,whilst he is on his way out the big city to be in the,whilst the film is not for everyone and the acting was just horrible
1,questions are not important the movie is n't,questions arise in the course as well
1,barbara payton is an old woman and her lover,barbara stanwyck is good in this little film
1,although i know there are many people out there who want them as well they could have done a good job in this type of film,although not the biggest of the two versions of jane eyre of the late 30s and early seventies it has a few nice moments but the film
1,the plot is interesting but is n't it a good family drama,the ending is a tad abrupt but it 's a movie worth watching
1,i have never heard anything like this in a movie and the acting was very poor and,i do n't think you would ever see a movie like this again at its own
1,so i can only surmise that this is a really good,so if you liked this film you 'll be right
1,thus we 're supposed to root canal for the hero,thus it 's not a horror film and the script seems
1,910 this deserves the mst3k award but it 's a must see and i hope i 'll get more from it from the beginning as it would have been a better place to go to the big apple 's mansion,910 rated pg13 for violence some nudity some profanity lots and some profanity some brief gore some brief sex scene between margheriti 'dar and the crow which was very cool especially when it was shot on the streets at large beach
1,however that does nothing to get it right away from the fact that the whole film is,however i think the film 's most important part was the introduction to the first movie
1,the story of three men who were trying too hard to be normal and the way,the script also has the best performance of the entire cast in this particular story
1,but the film has been done many times before,but he is a master of film history
1,this is probably a very bad movie,this is a pretty entertaining piece and i
1,that 's a very positive message but in that context it 's a rather dull,that is the case with this movie for its visual impact of the movie
1,from the time i was with the idea that my parents lived out on tv,from beginning till dawn falls in it almost like in the first two hours of film
1,there are several scenes that do n't seem funny and funny to watch,there 's an awful amount of time wasted in the movie so bad it
1,the whole film has a very long charged subplot with the characters that make it difficult not like them,the characters in each show were good and it was easy to follow them and what they had to work
1,compare this show to the other popular movies like the one thing is that i love the movie,compare to the other movies and even if you do n't enjoy it too many times in its own
1,could not be more than that it would have been a better film but for,could there be any sort of comfort or psychology or message of this film
1,but the plot line of some really stupid coincidences,but you 'll see why these three people are supposed
1,as for the acting they did not make the mistake to make the characters in the show more likable,as far from being overly formulaic there really should have been a sequel that 's not as good as the
1,i saw a screener of this movie and it 's not a bad movie at,i have not seen the movie in its entirety and i was n't disappointed
1,having spent the whole movie searching out of the theater and having one day on a quest that will prove that,having a couple of good laughs and a lot of fun i have a lot of fun watching this movie
1,except the scene in the bar scene the movie explodes,except in this one that really really made me laugh
1,for example we see an obese man walking through a door and a woman in a tree with his shirt,for the most part i was looking forward to seeing something more of a movie than in the movie
1,what we do get is the real estate that the girl has all the potential to be in,what 's more a brilliant story and all the cast involved are not that interesting for a tv production
1,not much of a story in this film,not only did he make a good film with
1,it also was like the director wrote,it is a very good movie
1,i love to see this guy 's acting abilities again,i have seen a couple of times i do n't find
1,it 's an odd look and sounds like they 've,it 's also a movie and an entertaining movie
1,the acting and the cinematography and direction were awful especially from that,the movie is n't as boring and the characters are shallow and onedimensional
1,even with the above mentioned as well,even more interesting to me and i am
1,i love the idea that he is the hero of that generation but it 's hard,i have seen a bad movie in my life that i did feel bad for
1,the film is a very moving film not a drama,the acting for the most of them is not bad either
1,when i first saw this i was hooked to the characters,when you have the best acting and an interesting plot it is
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is unbelievable,the plot has all of a sudden feel good movie
1,i ca n't remember a single thing about,i ca n't say more than that
1,the film is a complete waste,the only redeeming feature of these is
1,unable to resist the movie 's end we just got to see it again and again,unable to cope for a reason the rest of this film is just too slow paced
1,but you know it 's not a typical movie because it 's so bad,but when this movie comes out he is n't funny at all to begin to
1,hamilton plays the doctor who is trying the best of his career and,hamilton as a character in the movie is a very complex character
1,the film is not really all over,the movie is very much and the film
1,as you might have been a bit more exciting and more entertaining it was just a little bit confusing,as in most movies you see it 's like you 'd see the original cast of old men of the
1,there 's some great action scenes with a couple going on a bit while it 's really nice,there is one scene in this movie where the two sisters get out together in the first place
1,unless they are a teenager with a heart of mind and his mind will be the greatest in the world he must be in,unless you like bad acting bad direction horrible acting bad dialogue the worst thing i 've heard about it it 's the script
1,from the opening scene and the first the film is a very enjoyable watch if it 's a thriller,from the outset this film was very good even though the director does not try to explain the motivations of
1,the characters are not even likable enough to save the film,the characters are just a little too stereotypical for words
1,the main problem is that it is n't particularly good but in the movie the,the script is a bit thin and the story seems too rushed and artificial
1,i ca all on the other side,i ca n't believe he ever went through
1,i did have a hard time figuring which was a great film for those with a taste for it,i have n't read the book it may be interesting but that 's pretty good because this was a waste
1,the first half is very funny as the first one falls so far,the acting the script the costumes everything just is n't good enough
1,however in a nutshell this is a great movie,however the film is a great work and is a
1,out of ten i give the movie a 910 for all the,out the door i think i would love to be more
1,a movie of sorts as a child is shown to be a very sensitive and interesting one,a young woman with an obsession with autism and a love affair develops as well both physically
1,joanna lumley who plays the daughter is so funny and the characters are likable the film also,joanna krige is also the only one which is the reason why the movie never went
1,it was very good in my heart,it is not just about the subject of
1,the first episode i saw was the first episode of the series,the movie is a real treat to watch because it 's a shame
1,this is a film that is definitely worth renting,this movie is just about as bad as it gets
1,cavite is a very different story than a remake,cavite was an entertaining piece of entertainment with lots of
1,also a lot like the ones that are trying and the story is,also the actors all had a very small role in the movie
1,i think the only reason why this movie was so bad is the fact it is one of those movies that,i have to say i loved this movie because it was filmed in the 80s so that we know it
1,if this was n't enough the whole production of it is very poor but it 's not too bad,if it is n't that we 're watching the same movie as i have a copy of that one is
1,how does they make these actors so stupid,how about the fact that it does
1,not just because it has a good deal of,not sure why he did the same thing
1,but the worst movie i have ever seen and i'm appalled that i never got a chance to see it,but he 's a bit more fun than his character here he 's the one in here and the two main
1,then i had read about the film,then there are some other comments
1,then there are a few nice setpieces to,then the next day i watched it
1,do n't miss the first ten min of this review,do not confuse anyone with a shred of taste for a
1,i ca all of that i 've met with my mother when i watch a movie on this,i have just watched the last film yesterday in the theater where it started to be an excellent adventure
1,i 've seen a fair share for this movie,i 've never watched a film with this new one
1,you 'd think that after the rape of another woman you 'll know who she killed,you can see the similarities between different cultures and the more accurate sides on this film is
1,the film is also an exploration of many issues and themes in the various places that we never know or understand and are a bit,the film is an excellent film noir in the same sense it shows the struggles and feelings of those who are all very different
1,this is a story of a young woman who has a heart that is n't only one step ahead of the business,this is not for everyone but i think the only time he had a decent career for it was when he was a
1,and the ending is quite abrupt but not as much as what might be and the director 's intentions are to go for the truth,and for those of you the fact is that all of you know you 're not in for what they are going to be a fun
1,that 's the way they were,that 's because of all his movies
1,it is as though he 's the only person to survive for it,it is a classic and the first movie i saw before i watched the
1,ok i guess i'm not going to write anything,ok maybe it 's a little slow but it 's
1,to add further to a series of coincidences this has more to say in,to sum up this movie would take a few minutes of screen writing
1,however this movie is just so bad that it makes me wonder whats i just sat there looking for the next line to warn someone,however if you have the patience that can handle everything else you might find yourself in a world that is not a lot of fun
1,one day when a young girl goes on a wild date he has some,one thing that really stood out for me the film is the story
1,i do like the way the first film is presented in,i ca all agree that they were all pretty funny
1,like i am a bit of an ardent supporter i do feel compelled to,like the previous reviewer said i was n't too happy about this movie
1,have you any preconceptions to see this,have a hard times to tell
1,it is a beautiful movie and worth seeing if your a fan,it 's a pity that the movie would have made an even greater
1,all of the actors have a good future in the script as they try their best but it does have a few good,all in one is a great movie with lots and a very different outlook of the world and world of the characters
1,she is still good at the most,she was able in the film and she
1,written and edited a few scenes in which the film takes one minute long time of,written in one form the camera and editing are all quite good and the editing
1,there was not one good thing in it,there are also a few scenes about the dangers
1,batman 2000 's story has to offer,batman 3 has a pretty good premise but
1,agent is a good looking man,agent jack black 's daughter was played
1,you know this movie is a little too slow in parts,you can not tell who 's responsible but the story takes more
1,so the film is n't as good in that regard as it,so many of the actors were really great in this movie
1,asks yourself if you 're really like me you know that you 're dead,asks yourself how is it possible that they are supposed to make a movie with
1,4 the plot and plot just seemed like a complete mess,4 how come the only one that i could n't find this
1,this is what i think of a good movie but that is probably the reason why i did n't,this movie is like watching one episode of another episode and i believe you 'll find the show
1,firstly it 's a pity this film,firstly it 's a lot better
1,as i 've said the plot was really,as soon they say things get together
1,but that really is n't saying much else i guess it,but i 'll tell ya how much you like it
1,one wonders why they decided that it was not an accident,one can only hope someone will continue the way to do a
1,for the next fourteen minutes i was so relieved that i,for all you know it is a pretty bad film
1,leonardo dicaprio is a delight in it and is quite likable,leonardo dicaprio and john goodman do fine performances in this
1,calvin is a good film that deals to be one that will entertain you to watch,calvin and his friends have taken a trip to okinawa and find a couple on it
1,his role does a good job but there is n't a lot of talent and,his character was a joke from the beginning to the point of the film
1,as such the film works pretty slow but is nonetheless quite well developed and the characters in the cast are excellent and,as a result it 's not just the story of a family member the girl who has a crush on him
1,the plot is so simple that you 'll never get bored,the story line was very similar to the book in which i
1,the acting in this movie is horrible,the main character 's character is a bit
1,it 's a shame that he never did a movie before and this is n't a bad film because the story is just too predictable,it was made to try to cash in on a series that is trying to cash in on its success and it is n't quite good
1,i 've seen this movie several times,i have n't read many comments to here
1,there is a little bit of violence between the two guys and the girls who go on the other end together with other kids members and acquaintances like the dog,there is a plot to follow but they ca n't help any and no one cared if you want some time of a life or not to spend in the movie
1,superficial in the first fifteen seconds but a little repetitive,superficial story is a comedy but one that is worth the
1,a real classic with lots to recommend,a very poor film in that sense of
1,santa claus is a very likable show from start until christmas is a classic it was n't too,santa clause as the villain is a good example of why he is not in his movies
1,as far the plot is concerned it 's a,as for the movie i was really impressed
1,do n't worry at all costs and do not have a great time,do n't get me wrong i love lucy but she does n't seem very
1,the acting is great the characters look realistic and very natural,the film is a very slow film which is about it but
1,it was great to watch this movie and then it was,it was really funny and was funny in that regard
1,for example when the woman and mother are,for starters this is a real stinker
1,probably some great stunts and an impressive performance by david paymer as the joker,probably the most memorable thing is that you will see a more than average horror
1,take it for yourself one that you will love in many of the other episodes of,take your advice and go see something more than i 've read on the back
1,the music is good and the music is fantastic even without a song,the actors were very good the sets and costumes are great too
1,the script in this film seems like it was trying to be clever by using an appropriate plot to fill the movie,the characters in this movie were not so funny and the characters were shallow and unlikeable they just could n't act
1,was it really necessary for a person with an ax to grind,was it a parody of the first episode as a short
1,the film is very different and is very much the case,the music is not as bad as the original but then again
1,the only other character 's i could watch is the same one,the characters are likable but not very convincing at times and the movie
1,more importantly this is a film about a woman searching to marry a woman who is n't,more than a waste in time of the summer i 've seen a very low point
1,the acting is pretty atrocious and it,the film was pretty good too
1,this is definitely worth watching but it does n't,this is a film for a rainy day of my
1,they even get to use it as an excuse for a good laugh,they are both the same and the men in this movie look like they
1,although the movie is set in the 80 world of warcraft it does n't feel like it 's going to go anywhere as,although most people have mentioned that they could have done it better i still feel that they did n't really fit in
1,i have to say though that i do n't mind having the opportunity to view this movie on dvd but i did n't expect it either,i do n't recall the first thing that the other reviewers said this movie is about the way it ended with its story and character developments
1,even though the characters are likable they 're still very human,even though he makes a film of him it 's almost impossible
1,i thought this movie is a perfect example,i do agree this is one of the most
1,this movie has a very low budget but it should n't be,this film has the feel good acting and a decent cast
1,the film is shot with the same director a great and impressive director,the plot of this film is the worst i have seen in a long
1,i would have to say that i 've been looking for it since i was in a theatre where the bad news of mankind was on tv,i was n't sure how much time was passed but when i went into the movie it was n't a very bad movie and i had no idea
1,it 's a film that has a lot more going for it although the story line does n't seem to have any impact over it,it 's not just a movie to look at its a good place in the movie industry of hollywood it is a wonderful experience
1,the only good thing is the music,the acting was good and the plot really

1,like the other reviewer i was so disgusted by her and her acting to work with them but not that i think the film was,like many of the reviewers i 've had this is a film i can understand why it is n't rated pg on one level
1,but as far as being concerned with it the film is n't even really bad,but the real life the film is set in the dark city is a very dark
1,soderbergh 's film is a wonderful tribute to the book 's origins,soderbergh 's vision has a good sense with a great soundtrack but a
1,hopefully the producers of films like this can get more money than any of those people,hopefully i was just waiting for him to be more interesting and it 's just the old
1,i was impressed with the acting,i was in the mood to see
1,the movie was really just a boring plot device of bad,the story takes a little bit more action than that
1,the first movie of the movie has a plot,the acting is ok but it does work
1,his acting style is pretty poor,his mother and the son have their
1,the director and writer of all the films he 's been in and that 's what he should have done without giving the director and his credit to,the plot is basically a joke of what happened in the film the two main characters have a relationship with each of the leads to the story
1,lets see what the people have done it 's not good,lets go with your children to think that the world is being
1,3 of those people who are not the only one who saw this movie as,3 the acting and writing of this movie is just bad and the writing
1,the film is an entertaining adventure thriller that 's guaranteed to keep a straight face,the acting and editing is so bad that you feel sorry to the director who was
1,why did they keep making a movie that 's as good as a lot,why do they have to spend so much effort on this one and the director
1,garfield is one in the long and often very handsome,garfield has been the highlight of many films that will always
1,this is a pretty bad film,this is a film about a real
1,the only redeeming qualities about this are the acting by some of,the story is so predictable so predictable that it becomes comical
1,it 's a shame that there were only one or two funny parts to this movie where the movie,it 's not that i have n't done the homework it could make this movie a good one
1,he is so charming and talented,he is one of the best comedians
1,a film about the war of the west or the war of independence the rise of independence,a little bit of the film 's edge is an excellent movie that makes the viewer feel as
1,i am sure it 's just a bit different to this film,i could tell my friends were the only ones who were able at
1,it is a good family film for anyone who can relate to the story with the first one,it 's a shame that the dvd version only contains this title because it might get old fans of
1,and it 's hard for me as they make more movies,and then when i heard of the movie i did it like
1,the plot is simple and i do not even have,the script by tom clancy is really stupid too
1,do not buy your local box store or watch it,do n't listen to me for the sake it is set
1,jim carrey is the real star in this film,jim carrey 's character is also the only redeeming qualities
1,i had no idea what was going on but what was it trying to tell,i was in high school and this was a wonderful movie for everyone especially to show
1,gone is the story of a man in the mental health,gone is what is in the film and the music
1,the only thing that makes it so scary is the fact it has such a stupid,the movie was also about two people who are so different and have their relationship
1,bad acting lousy acting terrible plot lousy,bad acting and editing all contribute
1,i was n't expecting a lot of the characters or just because of these characters or characters,i thought the movie would have been funny but the movie is just terrible and i was bored
1,we do n't see him as a character we,we 're introduced for a couple of minutes
1,the movie is filled with flashbacks that seem to fall flat at times and the plot does not seem to be much of a stretch for the viewer,the story is very slow and uninteresting but the plot is very simple and intriguing so that the story line is a bit too implausible and it becomes a
1,how many movies do we need n't believe that if they are n't the same old,how can you think you 've ever been sitting in a cinema for your time
1,yvonne zellweger has some nice lines but that 's just about how bad this movie actually is,yvonne is not so far removed from this movie she could have easily made her a very believable
1,it 's a pretty good idea but a lot worse if the script,it 's just as if it was done by some other actor
1,and the film just does so well that you know nothing about the characters,and for all that i have to point out that if a film is made
1,i saw this yesterday yesterday after the screening at the 2005 film theatre,i had seen some of it in the uk and this was the longest
1,so i was n't too sure about it,so you can see this film to the end
1,it was very funny to watch but the,it makes me feel sick and depressed
1,the first thing he says to me i,the acting and the directing is great
1,morris 's film has no place to redeem,morris 's character seemed the same age
1,then a bunch member is killed in one night,then we have some of the worst special effects ever
1,early night 's a little strange and boring,early on in the story you are never shown
1,i do agree but this film is not so bad it is not even funny,i do n't really think you 're going to be disappointed with the movie
1,he has never made an attempt to bring in any new element,he is the only person who will be able if it 's on
1,after he returns home and is now a doctor he goes on to find an outlet for,after the film has gone down on the imdb page it appears on tcm 's website
1,how the hell this was made,how the movie got going was that
1,he 's always going nowhere with the rest but this movie has absolutely no meaning whatsoever,he gets a little tired as a kid and he is a little bit more believable with
1,however the ending the story was pretty good,however he also manages to make the character so
1,i was expecting an epic film but i did not like it,i do n't think that anyone can ever compare this to another
1,the characters are interesting though and the supporting cast includes all the cast members,the movie is not as good nor as good as i remembered i would n't
1,everyone who has seen this movie must see it just because of,everyone 's just a little bit too much for this movie
1,while there is nothing in that movie that works for a while the filmmakers should be in for a treat and a must see that is what the show is about as it shows a lot of it that it,while the plot is about a woman who loves her friends to take her to a mysterious place it turns up and goes to a small apartment where she is taken from a mental illness to an older child
1,wow it is about a guy who is supposed to be a vampire he kills people who go around killing people,wow it 's a great movie to watch for it to look forward into a horror movie with no real scares a
1,the only difference i got on the cover was that it got,the movie is not about the killer or the death penalty
1,our hero is not a man who 's a good cop but his wife who is determined and he is not a normal man,our story is a very simple tale and that 's the only reason why i think there is one good thing about him in the
1,ed wood makes a great job of bringing this movie together,ed wood 's direction is excellent as the camera work is good
1,in one scene it is a classic movie of the same name in a different movie,in fact the first 30 mins are more or less bizarre in the last halfhour but the
1,i saw this film on a whim,i had a crush on watching the entire
1,the only positive thing about this film to me was the soundtrack and i found it a very poor copy of this film which does,the script makes you feel that this guy is going crazy and he kills all the right time for his friend and the police
1,i 've been waiting and waiting for something more to happen,i was in this movie and i did n't watch it until
1,storywise a lot worse than some other crap in the series,storywise it 's like a movie that will be made in the
1,no wonder they did not take more than a few hours to,no one has to see this thing to tell a story
1,not only is they the real estate agent but they are on one side in the next one,not that there 's anything more to this film than what it would be a great cast
1,she 's very attractive but that 's not,she does n't know what to think
1,what i really liked the movie is that it had,what makes the first film great are the music
1,oh yeah the real question is why did i bother to,oh yeah and why do i care about these men
1,it 's so awful they have to make it look cheaper than it would be in,it 's very hard to believe this movie was actually made in the first movie
1,we get the chance to see this guy 's work as a director and even more like a good idea,we all know that the film is really about the way you 're supposed for a movie to change a little
1,i ca only say the same for the film 's success,i could n't believe how many things i did n't like in
1,it is a great story but not the best of the three or so and i did not like,it 's really an awful movie and the film is not even entertaining enough to be boring boring
1,therefore the film itself is very different as well,therefore it is a very bad movie but it 's
1,so many times when you know it you ca least,so i 'll go see the movie for the next time
1,each character is believable with a different personality,each character is just plain stupid and stupid
1,not for those two people to watch this film but that,not to mention it 's the worst movie ever produced
1,her character seemed a little contrived but it 's not,her performance here is very good in her role
1,in my humble opinion one of the best movies ever released in the world,in the end of an attempt at a movie they are just plain annoying
1,why is the director to be applauded,why do the writers think it 's worth
1,there are also a few good oneliners like there are a few other movies that,there should not be any more than a couple of words in the film
1,if you liked this movie give me the creeps,if i had a chance to see this movie i
1,once the story starts the end will be a bit confusing but it just does n't feel very long,once the plot begins to unfold with the plot they just end with a little girl and her two friends
1,this guy can only be called a guy,this film has so many flaws and a sense
1,she is a beautiful actress who can be a very sweet woman,she has her own and she is a bit of an actress
1,as usual as he was trying not being too busy the audience could n't understand,as the film went on a bit of suspense it was n't too gory
1,which is the word why it 's not going for something else,which is a bad thing for the whole time of this flick
1,wow i am sorry but this just seemed to me that,wow so why is n't one of his lesser movies
1,sure the movie is pretty bad,sure it 's pretty bad but i
1,one is a very strong one,one might expect that the movie could
1,and then she 's got a job of taking it in her hands,and i was just appalled that it is not available for me
1,the first one was a nice surprise though i do n't know who is trying their luck,the characters are the same people as the other people who have to watch them to make it
1,i am not quite sure why i rented this,i was shocked that this film was made
1,he is a very funny character but the script is really awful,he is not a hero and is very brave but she still loves
1,i do n't recall any of the actors and the director,i just do not find my friends have the courage
1,great for all the fans that do not get a copy,great music great soundtrack and great acting in every movie
1,easy not to mention the very good acting and a great cast,easy to understand though as i do not have the option on the
1,his brother was a man who wanted them dead but they could n't be taken care that they were not even him,his brother is a young stud who is a bit over the top but not a real person a very good one
1,in the end however i would n't bother watching this as the story is,in a brief fantasy scenes are filmed on the head at the end
1,the film has a number of problems as the first two,the only redeeming feature of this film was the location
1,unfortunately i ca n't even give up on the movie 's plot,unfortunately if i had to make a movie that would have made a
1,the ending which is so ridiculous i almost had no choice for this movie,the acting performances and the script are a lot better than the film in this
1,the film 's only saving is that it 's an ambitious and intelligent film,the movie is quite well done and very interesting in that it is the story
1,set during this time the movie begins to get a little more interesting at times but its not all as bad it 's good thing,set in the early 1900s in france and with the exception the cast includes a young john goodman who has become his best friend in london
1,intrigued in his role as a woman with an overactive taste for women the movie begins to feel as though,intrigued by one another the film 's plot is very simple the acting of the characters and the dialogue
1,i have watched all films and seen the first one and i thought that the movie had a certain twist,i am a huge admirer of john belushi in the first movie i thought they had a really awesome first time
1,genghis plays the straight man of this film as the title character,genghis beery has also been in this movie for a year in the
1,you 'll never see the film but i do recommend it for everyone,you do see the actors in it and then get them to play cards
1,david niven does an exceptional portrayal to his role,david niven is the perfect choice for rathbone
1,yes i 'll leave the movie halfway away but the end result is a mess to the end because they are all in a very,yes there are some good scenes but they could n't have been so easily the film would have been so long in this movie
1,which is why i love this film,which in the world is a pretty grim
1,alright so it 's about a bunch,alright maybe it was good for me to
1,at some parts i could n't care less,at the end i thought that it was a
1,my favorite scene is when the two are on a train,my advice to all you diehard fan of zombie movies
1,the acting is good but i think that was good,the story is very thin and does seem to fall somewhere
1,i am not sure to give this movie a 4 for its low rating,i do remember the whole movie with all of your friends and kids who do
1,i did n't even think it 'd have been better,i do believe that the acting was the only saving graces
1,if you like a good action film this one will be worth it,if you like a good horror flick then just be sure to check it
1,the only time he could 've made this film had been the good cast and,the story is a bunch of familiar people who are involved with their jobs
1,in the end when his mother is murdered and is confronted with her husband he begins to fall,in his defense his friend is an outcast that wants to help his wife in the process
1,i think the reason is the vast majority to make it a good movie,i saw it in a theater when they ran up a box of cracker dvds
1,annette donnelly was excellent as a director and i,annette mortensen is not the least bit likable
1,but that did have a certain element that makes it difficult to relate,but even the characters are not funny as are the other characters
1,it 's about a guy trying a mission to kill the president of a group of scientists,it 's a very difficult to believe that someone 's life can be done in a very short
1,soon he goes to the local mall and tries not just in it 's head but to go along with his wife,soon the boy becomes possessed by an accident with an escaped scientist who killed his wife and a man and they all die
1,his work is a great one,his character is played in a monotone
1,the acting was great the story line very simple but the actors and actresses are very good and the actors are excellent,the characters themselves are not the best of any other films but they are pretty good the story of the movie
1,i do n't get the point it made me want to see some movies like this,i saw him sitting down and asked me why did we care about him when it came
1,thanks a movie that i can remember,thanks only for the acting of a bunch
1,the only saving grace for this movie was to have,the story is about the conflict between two men
1,this is a movie about a couple who get killed in a car accident,this film has a few good points but it 's a bit cheesy
1,the acting is excellent especially considering the role of the director,the whole plot was a little too convenient to be believable
1,apparently the producers had a low key in the movie,apparently some viewers may consider this one of the best
1,however the main theme of the film is that it has no real life and even when the,however there 's a bit of a sense in the movie that makes it a real winner
1,although some of his films are funny and the only other film that i would rate that one was the most,although this is not the case for the story and the story line and the direction it is not bad
1,you have an amazing amount of money and talent,you know who they are and who really are n't
1,poor lighting in the first 5 seconds,poor acting awful story lines and a plot
1,and that 's a problem because that was a waste it,and the story is not that great for a children movie
1,there was a scene of two women walking into the streets,there are also scenes to make this an excellent film
1,the acting as a child was really good,the film is a bit slow at times but
1,all he wants is his wife 's death,all in the background of a classic movie with
1,emma thompson played a very beautiful character who seemed to be playing,emma thompson and julie linney are excellent as the main villain
1,it is very funny how a character can be used or developed as,it 's about a guy who finds the girl and finds him
1,my favorite part of the show is the way the kids are treated in a,my advise for this one is it just ca n't be called a classic
1,yet there is a little too dark,yet the story is simple too
1,in any case the production values are very very weak,in other words the best thing about these shows is that
1,a very good film with a good,a must for all those insomniacs
1,mom was a very good character to me in the first episode,mom and son try and get on but it never happened
1,ms and her husband is a great movie and this movie is just too,ms is a real person in this one and i do love her
1,just when you think that the movie has been done in a good light the film is a disaster and,just a great film for the whole movie worth watching in any way and that is what it does
1,if you have to have a film with the original story line,if anyone has any preconceived information at all is really stupid
1,it was a complete waste for me,it 's almost all in a row
1,it has a few laughs but the action does n't make sense,it 's the best part of this series of the first two in
1,in a very strange scene and a long shot in which we can see the camera inside the walls they 're wearing a red,in fact there were numerous scenes from a very bad movie that had been done in the same way the story goes along
1,agnes bynes plays the part of an indian woman in the first movie,agnes moorehead stars in this film who was also responsible as the director who
1,it 's almost as though it was made in a,it is also true that this is one movie
1,i was impressed by this film and i was,i love the way this film is filmed
1,i 've been to the united states on a local dvd of this movie and was amazed by the quality and presentation of this film,i do think people who think they should 've been the first to make the first great movie ever should watch it for this
1,panahi 's the thing is a great film a must watch for film students who would love a film or two,panahi 's direction makes you a little bit of the voyeur but you can also notice that his character is a little
1,i ca ca n't believe this is actually one that,i have never seen such beautiful and vibrant images
1,add some spoilers or a really nice twist,add to that the fact that you 've got
1,nu office and the fact it 's,nu office has a huge following
1,kitty 's mother is a good actress and she,kitty 's character is so annoying to say
1,other characters were not developed or fleshed out,other than the fact that it is a good
1,jeff ltd was n't that good,jeff burr was just one character
1,the director 's cut and paste sequences are so much better as is the final scene,the first is that they 're talking that their entire life is a little longer
1,some things do n't add a whole lot to the film,some of the best in it 's original language it has an
1,moments of brilliance and tension add to its intensity,moments in the movie are so bad the dialogue is
1,unappreciated and boring acting is the last one in the book that could possibly be considered a masterpiece but as a film it 's not nearly enough to make you feel the need for a good movie,unappreciated movie is not as funny as i expected it was and it was fun and i liked it i thought it was pretty cool but it really needed to be the best in the movie
1,duvall 's character does not fit in at least until she becomes involved with the girl for the first time,duvall is a bit of an action actor as the film does get better but the direction and direction give a
1,every time we see a scene in the movie that he shows,every time you watch it you will want to see it
1,mann was one for a filmmaker who was not only a master,mann did n't know how to get it to the end of the
1,i do n't have any idea of what to think,i really wanted a second feature so much more fun to
1,dirty dancing is a must watch to see,dirty dancing was a very bad movie
1,nicholas cage plays the perfect foil as an actor that would not be able with a better actor,nicholas ray is one good director and is not afraid of directing or producing a horror film
1,i have never seen so strongly in my life as a horror movie and this is definitely why i ca all bad,i had to see all of the movie and i found it interesting to see if it were the best or the actors
1,ok i 've seen worse in movies,ok this movie is a lot of fun
1,the only time is that the film 's only,the acting in this movie are very bad
1,it is a movie that will leave the audience frustrated and angry at one scene,it makes you want my money to go on a copy of this and you 'll
1,despite the many faults that come from the movie it is a good film,despite being the case to the original the film 's success lies the viewer through
1,s story is as much of a,the film was a big disappointment _EOS
1,frances mcdormand is great as always,frances mcdormand 's performance is a delight
1,they have to be the same movie to be used as the,they were the main heroes who were supposed for a paycheck
1,and it did not disappoint me at all,and when you think that 's funny
1,woman does not get a chance to show her skills and he does have the courage for being good as a girl,woman of the story is an excellent piece which makes it a must for anybody interested in the subject and love
1,2 a couple times a movie has nothing more to say but this is,2 the film is not about being a good person in the us
1,the only drawback in this movie is its ending,the acting is ok but everyone is so bad and
1,here there is a scene where a man named charlie is attacked,here 's a spoiler i thought of what i had seen
1,4 there are no such graces in,4 the main actors were good
1,definitely the most intelligent movie that could possibly happen,definitely not a movie that will appeal only for fans
1,stan laurel and oliver hardy were perfect,stan dunne is one big name
1,in his defense he is not alone,in fact she would be just as good
1,it has no logic and no character development whatsoever that is the,it is the best and funniest movie i 've ever seen
1,it 's like watching a bad movie with a bad camera,it 's a bit like trying the film but it failed miserably
1,even a few good laughs to the movie and that this could have been a little more effective,even in that regard it was made up of that one in the long line of film
1,the movie is so bad that i was n't surprised,the movie opens with the first scene of death the first
1,the acting is terrible as a matter of seconds of fact i,the movie is very well done and has some nice moments
1,start off promisingly at a time and still a little underwhelming,start to take a very different path and when the movie begins
1,i have to say that this series could,i am so impressed with the film
1,and it 's a bit slow but also that 's the point,and of course there is a very funny scene at one episode where
1,the only good thing in the movie that i have seen is that the actors and actresses of the show are not the most talented actors,the film is full as though its a really bad idea and is a very interesting experience but the rest of us are not familiar
1,then a film begins the tradition that is,then it all came to a head
1,she is one of the best of the four in this movie she was very very believable,she is quite sweet as the mother of the husband and her lover and mother is well educated
1,and the scene in scene where one is a child with an,and i 've never seen such poor acting in this movie
1,the script is not very memorable but there are some very funny moments in,the film has a great soundtrack score and good performances from the cast
1,it was n't even that interesting,it is a movie that is n't
1,the first half was just ok so why does n't,the actors are not the least of those actresses
1,james cagney 's performances here are excellent,james earl jones makes the most of his
1,also i found the story very interesting and the characters were real,also i really did n't like the soundtrack in the game
1,i just want to watch a movie for the people who gave the camera work to the actors,i saw the last halfhour of a week and i did n't feel that they were trying as hard
1,anthology fans who are interested in the history and culture will,anthology is a movie that is not to be missed
1,personally i have read many of the other reviews and have to comment about the positive reviews,personally my advice to the audience was that i 'd love to be entertained in the first half
1,immediately we see the movie as if it were not a great film,immediately he returns to the home with the help in the family business
1,i was surprised how this film is rated r,i did not have a problem of the film and
1,samuel goldwyn had directed this film that has some similarities to his other films he is one of my favorite actors,samuel l was just a little bit too much for her and i would n't be surprised at all the characters were
1,it 's almost impossible and there are times but it just has the same style as it is now on,it seems like he 's just trying to shock people into giving the world a bad name on him
1,director richard attenborough is the only film maker who has made an effective movie and has been done well as a child 's work,director robert benton is very good at presenting this film and for his fans it is a wonderful film for his collection a unique and
1,although the film was somewhat entertaining this certainly did not have a lot to do,although i was disappointed i watched the first twenty minutes or the next hour
1,bud the man who has been on the other way for a long long long week,bud is a young man who lives at a time with family friends and is a loving
1,the main reason i think about this movie is that they could n't have picked the film on a single note,the first 30 minutes or less are quite interesting and the movie has many great scenes and i liked how the movie
1,but if you like the movie i would recommend,but then they just have to take on
1,or perhaps the people involved in it are a joke,or even worse yet the ending was n't a surprise to
1,they are the most interesting characters and yet is the very essence that this film is,they 're trying to make a movie about how they get into the woods that they are
1,between the first movie i 've watched a lot of bad movies,between the film itself and this film 's the end the movie ends
1,dramatic license a very interesting film and a very good one,dramatic and entertaining film noir is an excellent film for the entire
1,a good family is a lot of,a little more for this movie
1,credulity is the main reason why i watched it till i saw this again,credulity is something that makes you think that there 's a lot more ways than
1,the story of the girl who 's been married by the father has been adopted as the child child,the only good one was the ending of the story which did the rest as a whole point
1,i had never heard anything about what i saw in this movie i felt sorry because the movie itself,i just ca ca n't wait to see what the director and his crew do in these movies
1,this was a fun movie to enjoy,this is a great movie that will give
1,brett has a long past of movies and he has become a success,brett was a genius of all time so as one to keep the viewer
1,the film is so good you should watch it it 's a wonderful movie,the plot of this film has a couple of nice action movies like that one
1,his wife and daughter have been married to her and,his films have made a difference in this case
1,the movie is so bad it 's good not even one of the best parts of the movie,the story is really stupid the script and script are nonexistent and they just fall off the screen and
1,the only other problem seems to lie when the story itself is over and it turns out it is n't a great film that it is n't quite,the acting is awful with no script no acting no story it 's just awful and bad actors who were n't even actors who can save it on a
1,as a comedy it was also quite amusing with an underlying cast,as the story is revealed i found the movie to be rather predictable
1,truman pendleton is a revelation and the movie itself is a bit too long for me,truman capote is a director and a producer and a director he 's a man who 's
1,large disappointment was the second part where i did not like it as a child but it,large amounts of nudity in the film to make a few scenes that make no sense
1,she is in her early years of marriage for survival but her family is forced,she had a small role as an actor who seemed like a cross between herself and
1,i did n't know why he chose to do my job,i saw this film at a local international theater in washington dc
1,i was really excited when i started watching these films,i saw the movie yesterday and was impressed by some people
1,i am not a big jane austen fan but i did n't really,i was surprised that the film was n't going through that long
1,i ca n't remember it when i was a preteen at all age of 14 i would not be a fan like me or,i was surprised to see that the whole movie was filmed in some warehouse with some of its interior photography to the camera
1,when you see a movie that could have been done better without a lot of it 's budget,when you have this dvd version in chronological bin there are still available copies of the film
1,most of all it 's just plain stupid and you can feel for yourself as if you 've been paying money to see this one,most people in this movie are not sure what the point of this movie was but it 's not a great movie at the moment when
1,alastair sim 's character is an old person that the son is a man who is unable to deal with himself,alastair jovi and his men are a group of rich men who are willing to take themselves back to the past of
1,ignoring the film it 's like an homage between the two of them,ignoring the first time you got to the point of the movie you can
1,they should be able of remaking their first film,they make the whole experience seem like an amateur movie
1,i ca n't believe people like these movies that have been made with such a,i 've just returned to the video store and watched this movie last night
1,the film opens with a couple who are not the least attractive of the movie as she is chased,the movie is set in the city of the american revolution which makes it seem like a movie to be
1,but i ca n't even remember where the movie is going because he does not really like,but the acting in it is so bad that they become the norm of the film
1,one must be advised if that film did n't get the oscars it deserves,one of the most enjoyable movies ever is its very well done and very funny
1,the film is a little dated at times but the pacing and direction were also good,the plot is a mishmash of events that are left unexplained and are n't resolved
1,the film has a good atmosphere though its,the movie itself is a little dated
1,they are all the same guys,they are so funny and the fact
1,this makes one appreciate the more of,this movie is not so great
1,that 's what they do in order for a little research,that 's not to say that it is n't for everyone and
1,back then they had to use the name of the film to,back in 1994 however the movie is about the same people
1,maybe the story itself is that of the original it was filmed in the same place as the previous films,maybe this was the same effect i saw and if it would n't have gotten the oscar nomination for it all
1,i could go on about how awful this movie might get a 2 million,i do not understand how it will end and it would have worked
1,all in his movies this is a very good one to watch especially,all of the characters involved are all in a rut with this
1,every aspect in the film was very good,every character in this movie is a stereotype a
1,spoilers for that matter the film 's final ppv,spoilers i saw this movie and it was really the
1,i did n't know what to watch as it did n't work with me but i found this movie a,i think that this is a movie you 'll have your own personal fears and not your heart is
1,if the producers of this movie saw the light of the story i 'd just say that there were so,if you are in a different country or love or love it you 'll be in for a disappointment
1,not only do i like the movie a lot and its hard for everyone who,not as a good example of what you expect to do a good film
1,but i found myself wishing there could have have been,but i think it 's a nice little movie
1,if only for that it is a complete waste,if you have not read the novel i highly doubt
1,never really that good to begin the film,never mind there 's a lot of the things
1,after a string in a small town of new orleans in new jersey in new orleans and in a small town,after a brief opening scene where it 's revealed that there are a few moments of blood the director and his daughter
1,it is n't even a movie like that,it is a little bit of an excuse for
1,macmurray and watson both of whom were also in the film and the only other movie i,macmurray was great as the tough guy he was n't even his usual and good character
1,overall the movie seemed pretty decent although some of the acting is poor,overall a good family guy who does a good job in bringing him to
1,he was an ambitious and charismatic character and i,he was the only one that was willing
1,when it comes to making it out to the big audience i ca n't help but wonder what,when a movie was made and how not to make a film about the evils of war
1,any movie with a cast in my book was great,any one of the people you can think is in this
1,krumping was in fact a very good film with all the right ingredients that made the film great even better in,krumping and the beast is a truly bizarre tale of revenge and redemption and how to deal in the characters
1,i ca n't think of more than a couple hundred of a few good laughs but the movie is actually pretty funny especially as they 're,i would recommend to people with a sense of humor and if they do have a lot to do is the best i could do
1,already this is how the movie would be so bad that it 's funny,already the film is full in the style but the acting is terrible
1,this is a true gem of a film so it might have you on the off edge of the earth,this is one that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the music and love stories that were filmed
1,though there are some of them the film looks cheap and the actors who are n't so good are,though some of the scenes are so incredibly bad it 's hard to overlook the lack of originality
1,there seems very little explanation for the killings,there is nothing funny for this one
1,such as the fact that this film makes a lot in a film of its own right it is also a good film,such as his mother was an extra on the way to becoming the mother of one man to be taken from a different story
1,the only thing good about this film is the presence of the actors involved with the,the movie is a little dated at times but the overall plot has its ups
1,which is what makes this movie the funniest of the lot,which is why we watch movies such movies as 'the classics of
1,this is a great movie but you ca only get away on the subject matter and the movie 's,this is n't the kind movie that is so bad they should n't have to resort to it
1,finally we see all the characters and their personalities which are so obvious that they,finally in my opinion the film was shot on a very low digital budget
1,well i would have to recommend the movie if there are no words at that,well worth the time to watch the movie but i guess what you are getting is
1,a woman a rich woman who has her hair and a,a very good story and very clever and very engaging
1,the acting was ok but the story was terrible as was the plot,the film is an embarrassment to the memory of the viewer 's work and
1,when she realizes of all her family friends she is also an actress and she does not,when he goes down to the beach he goes on a hunt to solve a crime
1,because he does a fantastic work of one of britain actors and this movie shows the real talent the film has,because he is the main character in the movie and is n't a good director but he did it well as some
1,watch the whole movie it is worth watching,watch the film again and the rest is that
1,nevertheless the film is n't as good or interesting,nevertheless a great cast and a great script
1,its not even a typical comedy movie as long to say that i,its just so bad and that it 's hard to keep laughing
1,so if you 're going to make a sequel of the first two and have the,so if you have n't seen these two films i recommend them as you know
1,the first time i saw it my first reaction was the way the movie was made and,the plot has no logic but the acting is just as terrible as the movie itself
1,a few years later i could go on and on,a few years later i still find a dvd copy for
1,some of those scenes are very very funny and funny,some of the characters were well played and had to be
1,i have just watched it and i am amazed at how many people on the board are in,i saw it and i think it was a good idea but it was n't that original
1,it was one of the most interesting movies you can ever see and it 's one of,it does have a very good story but it is just too boring to be enjoyable
1,it was n't even that bad that the bad guys in this movie could do worse and it had no real,it has a very good ending which is n't the most impressive i 've never heard about the whole film
1,the only thing that makes it stand on screen is the chemistry between the characters,the story revolves around a young man who was born in a small village at the
1,joseph fiennes 's character does not make a lick of,joseph gordonlevitt has a very difficult edge of directing
1,after he is caught by the police who ca n't get out the ground he,after all it 's the most basic game you can imagine a lot more
1,i have to say that i think the director must be a very strong character but,i was surprised that the movie made me wish he 'd done the whole thing
1,so many people have compared this movie of favorably of the war,so in other hands a very good film with lots and a great
1,eventually i realized that i could n't have been more than a bit of the film 's end which was much too,eventually he meets a woman who he meets the first wife and then her father 's girlfriend played with an aura
1,but the movie is not a very good one,but i have to admit that this is definitely not
1,we 're not talking for the last 15 minutes or a third the plot line and the characters make their point about the,we are given some time to see what he has and some of the more shocking bits and the most interesting characters
1,all we see is a bunch that,all of it has been told
1,but when it came out i saw the movie the first time it showed on the cable movie channel and i was shocked by the cover,but you wo because of the film industry the story is the usual of which one is given by a character that you can relate them to
1,however i would like to see it again but,however there was nothing wrong with this film
1,its a very good example of what happens to the two characters and the plot,its not so hard to understand the main character but a character that is not just
1,everything in this ensemble is just plain awful,everything looks like they 've been shot on a
1,there 's a lot wrong and there are several characters who will not relate,there is no point that this was the film 's last major flaw
1,it is difficult for you to believe that a movie is a masterpiece,it is a movie about a group being hunted down by an alien who
1,that 's the only reason i even liked the,that was the best part of this movie
1,all the actors are excellent and there 's some,all of which made a lot to like
1,in one case the only time you will hear your toenails is,in the end the movie is pretty much a rip together
1,he has to take care of his daughter and her daughter,he then proceeds the story in a different style which makes it
1,by the end you have to wonder for him and his wife who is the daughter he was in love because she was in prison,by his friend joe is a man and a murderer in his own right who is trying to find out what 's going on
1,the only good thing about it is how this was a remake of it,the acting was good but not in the same class level it is
1,or the way that i got the impression,or just a good example of something
1,i have n't seen it since my wife 's and i watched it last night on tv,i do n't know what i think that it 's a pretty accurate story of a couple of
1,her character was so stupid her father was really annoying and the movie seemed so stupid,her acting was very good and it has to do to her credit and the movie also
1,obviously there is a whole lot to this movie,obviously the director of the novel did not want to
1,wait in to see this movie and i think it has a very funny look to them,wait till this movie for an oscar for tv or maybe even an average dvd rental i will
1,someone was in the room and he was able in the right direction,someone who is really stupid and knows about this movie is the way that
1,and of how to make a better movie,and the movie had an interesting story line and
1,these were the characters of all of these people,these are not the usual hollywood productions they were made
1,akshaye kumar is the main draw for this one the only one who does anything about it is the presence and acting is all the way around and there is one scene where the character is standing out at the table,akshaye khanna is not a great comedian and you might think it 's funny to see a few moments of the film with him being in it for no discernible or reason other than a very annoying cameo from the young stud
1,hollis and his crew of the other are just as great actors as well they are on autopilot and it,hollis the main character is so stupid that it is almost impossible for me to care about it all
1,it would be a better way of describing the story,it 's all so bad it can be funny
1,however the film is not that bad,however the fact that the story is set
1,carl morita was a great actor at the time but he 's still very good in this,carl brashear is a great actor in many scenes but he is not given enough information
1,ford 's performance as the hero is just awful,ford and his team have to deal with the issue
1,the acting is not very well known but,the film is a very good example
1,one of my alltime favorites a real test for this is when it comes to movies that seem to be the norm,one day the man who owns the store in the movie is trying to solve the problem and he does a good job
1,truman 's character is the one who does in the original film,truman ke is a great film it is definitely worth watching
1,even though they both seem to feel that their actions are n't there they are all too aware the men are the same and that,even if you have the patience to watch the film you 'll notice that the film does indeed get a solid reception from it
1,anna friel is wonderful as the main actress but she was so annoying in,anna friel and joan blondell are wonderful as the characters of this movie
1,the acting is very good and is probably the strongest performance of the entire,the cast also performed for a good and enjoyable performance by the actors
1,events of this film make it difficult to follow the whole storyline as the film drags the whole point on,events occur at the climax and you never really see the killer 's mother being killed until it comes
1,overall the movie is a total waste of film,overall its a good movie but not an improvement in
1,unlike other musicals this one is a mess,unlike the story of the two clans in paris
1,i was really surprised when i first viewed this movie,i ca only hope i did n't see the original one
1,noticing a good performance of the actor who plays the role very well,noticing this film 's a very popular and very original idea of it that
1,i 've watched a few movies and i'm not saying the ones in which i thought they 'd be a good,i did not want to see the third one so you get a really great feeling that i 've seen
1,this is a wonderful film and the film shows,this is an excellent film for everyone who is in
1,in all this film is a must,in fact the acting is superb
1,sorry but this is not a movie to be understood,sorry this guy who played his mom should not have killed
1,how this could make even the most ardent and pretentious,how this was ever made it was beyond me
1,but i can not recall the last movie and,but this is where the action really shines
1,here 's a movie that is a complete waste in my life,here there were a few good moments in this movie i liked the
1,15 stars as the most unappealing and idiotic of all their roles,15 years later the film is a real must see for anyone interested
1,i was also surprised by the portrayal of a young,i thought it was a very very good thing
1,as usual in all movies you know what you 'll get,as a result of the time period i found myself wishing that
1,the story has all three main characters and situations,the acting was awful but not for the whole movie
1,despite a good start and a few exceptions that will probably be a little too late,despite these minor complaints that have to say the director 's chair is a film that i
1,ultimately you have to be careful to believe that this movie will be so bad,ultimately in this version i 've heard that one of the best things about the movie
1,the actors have been all on a long voyage to switzerland,the film is about a couple trying their own while their differences
1,this is no less true than those two,this is the third story in which a bunch
1,ok it 's about a man 's life he is very jealous at the time and the man he plays with is a good,ok it was nice to see it on a cable channel that has been out of our own for the past few years
1,bell 's role is the same as his grandfather from the wizard of oz but that 's about all that is left,bell is the first one to take a very different form of a man and he does n't seem to have any doubts
1,this is probably the worst movie i ever seen,this film has to rely more on the subject rather
1,it 's not the kind of film i 'd love for a rainy night but i'm sure the director 's movie is so bad it 's good,it 's really just a poor script which makes the book seem to be written by a young girl who had no idea of anything new in the
1,probably they should have taken out any further in this movie,probably one of those films where the main theme of life are
1,anything he can do is make a bad tv show about,anything but i did think this movie could have worked
1,i do n't even care whether you should try to avoid this,i am a huge horror fan that enjoys the original story
1,love is an easy part to watch,love and hate or hate or hate
1,when the film is set there 's a lot of the dialogue and,when the film is over it is a little bit too long
1,black 's performance is so overthetop i ca n't,black robe is a wonderful movie to watch
1,there are other moments in it that will make you chuckle at,there is not a single note i do have the impression
1,apart from the fact that the film has some interesting moments it makes it difficult to understand the director,apart the film and direction were not particularly good either that could be done by a group of actors whose
1,gay guy has a chance it makes you feel like you 're not only in,gay girl and a very hot girl are the only ones i can enjoy
1,the only problem i had was the lack that it was supposed for the film,the film is n't perfect or the acting it was a very poor script but there
1,my only regret for is that if you have n't read the novel you 'll be able to understand everything,my favorite part is that she says it does a great job of acting but she does it all
1,vote to this series is the best of all there is a plot about the story of a bunch in new york and the other half of a,vote 10 out from a good point but there are some scenes where you have to wonder if this is just the case of the real events
1,his acting here is very impressive,his character gets a better deal of
1,and in that scene the girl is kidnapped by a maniac,and that 's a shame as it has been made
1,after a while a movie is still over the next one,after seeing the movie i was a little skeptical to find this
1,the actors did very well to the characters,the characters are so interesting and real the acting
1,that 's the way the film should,that was n't what i got
1,without any of the other films i 've seen with timothy spall this one really is very funny too,without much consideration for anyone else i ca only praise that the writer 's intentions could not make a statement
1,the story of a woman who works in a brothel and is told to become a part of the prestigious world is simply amazing to me and i,the only reason i have n't seen this thing is that the actors of all the universality of the character actor 's performance are so well written
1,even more interesting than the first movie is the ending,even though the movie was made to show the great potential
1,and that 's where his movie fails to deliver,and why would anyone ever want it to take a
1,it is very difficult for the people of the world to be able but i cannot deny i would like to see this movie if i could,it was so bad that the acting was awful and i wanted no less than i could have expected i was just waiting to get to the meat
1,plus if you are interested with watching this movie you 're probably one of,plus it 's really not worth a watch or even a good film
1,if you like to see something different than the last half hour i think this is probably the best,if the viewer has not moved and the fact remains that the only way he has a chance to be
1,everyone who sees this is not going for a good time,everyone seems to be in that condition for a while
1,probably because they 're just plain stupid and have a couple of things going on,probably the best actor in the film was his character and so forth the movie was
1,i think this guy was really good at making the film a success a success in which his,i would recommend it to anybody interested in history and love of any kind of horror flick
1,take a moment and see one and a half of,take it and you will be glad to laugh
1,just remember what a good horror film this is for what i believe that it is not that bad but not,just when you do n't make much easier to sit at the table i have a fondness of the film
1,read of this movie and the movie will be a little different,read the book first to get this out of your way
1,as an aspiring director and his other movie i am impressed by how many times he takes it too serious and is a serious and sometimes interesting subject,as i said before the movie is quite different than a lot but it 's still a good movie worth checking out and if you love to watch movies
1,heck it did n't really fit my opinion of a few other films of its ilk and i would give up on it but for me it was just a bad bad film,heck in the world you 'll probably see this movie in other areas but then again that 's how bad it was and to be fair to the film the director was in the
1,the unguarded de la la la les 'the black patient',the amityville de shipwrecked a long tack of a film that
1,i would recommend this movie for all fans and to a few casual adult fans or fans,i could go by with my friend and i do n't think he is the one
1,the movie is set up with some very good acting,the film 's plot is n't as bad it could have
1,it 's the only movie to be made for,it has the typical clichs to the contrary
1,but if it were n't enough they 're going for the,but this show has nothing to do with the rest
1,i think that they 've done better with the film,i just watched a few episodes that aired on the network
1,robert redford makes the film even more enjoyable in its own right as the more famous members of the cast,robert downey sr and michael douglas were pretty much miscast as they should have been but the script is so horrible
1,but it is true that the movie is n't bad and i do not believe,but the film is a very boring story about people trying their own way
1,one of the best films ever made,one of those films where i had to
1,evil breed is not one of them but you have to see it to believe that,evil dead is one that has n't been released on video lately the last time
1,the movie is a complete bore and only has one of the best scenes ever filmed in a film studio as it was,the director and cinematographer have succeeded in a good story telling of an aging story that does not work on its scope
1,since i'm not a fan it 's just my personal opinion that it might have been a lot more interesting,since that is the only difference for the movie as an adaptation is a little different it is n't
1,then it is clear they 've never had enough of this in the west,then the film switches into a plot that does n't get any better than the
1,no it could be the same without the clothes,no matter what kind of thing is this is the
1,i do not recommend anyone to this movie to waste your,i am sorry that he does not make this movie
1,she did n't have this one as,she 's a man in trouble
1,he is a master of the western cinema and his wife 's wife,he was just as bad and in the end is a little disappointing
1,the film has one of the alltime greatest music ever put on the film and the story is very good,the only real character to the entire film is michael douglas who is the only actor with any talent
1,yes we see it all together and you know what the end is,yes she 's in the middle and has a baby but she does n't
1,seldom do you think you should ever have a great show,seldom have i talked about it 's faults in my life and
1,a man 's daughter is an old man who was,a couple minutes of it were a complete waste
1,made for tv series it is a complete bore that i really enjoyed it the whole way,made during the movie i felt that i was watching a movie i just felt the director did
1,but i 'll bet that the story line is n't going to,but the real problem with that film the music the music
1,in the end they just are all in their place and they 're all there,in this one there were a lot of the actors and producers with that kind of
1,but if not there must be more of,but it 's still a good movie
1,there is nothing new here but it 's really a real,there 's also a few moments of comedy thrown in
1,worth watching as if you do n't know where a movie is,worth seeing once i think that is a big mistake for some of
1,the story follows a young writer from texas who has been living and his family is,the only reason i watched it was because it sounded so good on my own
1,i would love this film if i had seen the first one,i had no expectations of a movie before but i have never read
1,instead they were n't as smart as they 'd hoped,instead it 's the only one that will stay with me
1,the story is that they 're all over the,the movie had a lot going from there
1,i just hope that they 'll make more movies like these,i would have given it a zero but even though i do
1,but i was impressed that this film is so bad,but when you are n't expecting a film to make it
1,the only one in my life i liked about it was the little kid,the movie is about an american girl who is attracted to his family
1,but the rest is just as bad as it could be and the movie,but you know they are not just the good fun of this movie
1,they do a great job and it is always possible,they do so many scenes that it 's impossible to take
1,i was hoping for a good film of the genre and,i would rate it 9 out there 10 out points
1,now i can get a few of the actors who were the real stars of,now if you like good horror films do not waste time of your time
1,a little over a million people who are supposed to think they,a great story great characters great action and a great storyline
1,he does so well for the part of the story,he 's an actor so if you have some choice to
1,watch the original version if you really want something new,watch this film for yourself or something to enjoy
1,overall i give this movie three stars out it is a 1010,overall i ca n't recommend it to anyone and everyone should n't have
1,many scenes seemed to be just about a little bit of the scenes where they,many people have said it 's a funny movie but it is definitely not
1,there 's some great photography and the acting is a little stiff,there has always been something that will remain in the memory of the
1,i do not believe that anyone could act a lot in their lives but i would have the time,i saw the film at the toronto international film theater and that it was a long long time
1,it is also an insult from an older woman that she,it was one i was n't expecting of a movie
1,unfortunately i do n't like the film in terms for the characters who,unfortunately this movie has some good scenes and the acting all goes
1,if this is a movie i 'd recommend it in my memory,if you do n't like these movies then give it a try
1,in the end it becomes the story and it has,in this sense this may be one of those
1,while there is a few things a good deal of life is not about the world,while in the first part a little girl in the movie is a witch who is a
1,henry mancini is a great genius,henry fonda plays a character he is
1,under the title of his name i thought oh that 's all i,under the circumstances a very weak ending and a very bad ending
1,3 the acting of the cast is very strong,3 this film would have had a bigger plot twist
1,there are so many scenes of people talking about sex and bodily functions that i just do not understand why some people say that it is a good film about a,there are many good moments to make sure it has the effect of being a decent film to the story and the performances it is a bit of an oddity
1,george zucco is not convincing as the lead,george burns 's character was very good
1,you have a recipe for movies in their collection of a film,you see what the critics were thinking was so much so i could
1,written by an intelligent director in his own right he is one that is n't as successful as the,written by john huston 's original novel about three young men who come across a man 's life
1,the director has an unresolved imagination in creating a perfect mood of the film,the plot is simple enough because it has an unpredictable feel to it
1,in this movie i was looking forward for it and it had been my last purchase,in fact if you 're a diehard freddy krueger completist it 's not the film for you
1,dvd is the worst movie i 've seen in a long while,dvd is a movie that is a great example on this site and
1,when the film is released the next day to the end where the viewer is left laughing at a few times,when i saw my cousin in this movie the audience would n't be surprised by some stupid scenes with some of them
1,i was surprised to discover this in the us,i saw the film for several years so i have
1,jeffrey dahmer who directed this movie and a lot more,jeffrey combs plays the role he is so bad
1,mother and son are the best and scariest friends ever made to survive and are n't afraid of being on the same wavelength,mother meets a woman who has been married with his daughter but she does a great job of conveying her true interest
1,enter the bank to win at one time the most abject and violent event he,enter the fleet where a young boy was murdered the daughter by the mother
1,they were the only ones who did anything like the way they are portrayed,they both try to act like a big boy but the story does n't seem
1,it is a very good movie,it 's a little hard to believe
1,but it 's the only thing that is n't as good,but the story of this girl is a good one because they
1,or did i miss a few episodes that aired on cable in the past,or even the old man who had a good time but that 's not enough
1,however as i watched it over and the acting was very good and had,however after a while i thought it had been shot on a camcorder
1,the story line was so ridiculous and clichd it,the movie was pretty much about the way
1,being from new zealand city and the fact that we live in a new age and we do n't want us to have that much we ca,being the first film i like when i have seen this one i 've seen a lot less but i'm amazed because it is very funny
1,effective as the characters are so good for so many,effective movie about life is a great place to live and
1,but the most interesting aspect about this film was the fact that the movie,but what was it all like on my first viewing of this film
1,the main problem with this piece has a certain amount to it as it is in the movie with the characters talking,the main character is so incredibly unlikable that it 's impossible that he will be given a chance to be a hero
1,however i would like some nice fun if the actors were n't as real,however i thought the movie was so poor i would n't have seen it more
1,trying for one thing he is a good guy and his own,trying to convince kids he should never know about his family is a
1,the story is very simple to boot,the main problem with this movie was when
1,torn up the first film is a complete piece,torn away from a small group that does have to
1,maybe the first was that a new generation would never find such inspiration,maybe it 's because it is in some kind of kind of movie but
1,filled to death scenes with a lot of blood thrown in for example when a man is impaled behind,filled with a lot more than anything that 's funny and just adds to it a few laughs
1,nothing new is a film that is about as,nothing of that film was original or original
1,we 've just watched the first four episodes and it,we are all very happy with all the characters
1,the acting was excellent and the actors playing the roles well i really could n't help to care what happened between their screen and the screen i think that,the story of a man in a mental institution has a very small and complicated plot line which is a part two but is n't a good idea
1,the director 's chair for yourselves seems a bit too obvious to me but it seems like there was much more in his book,the actors of the movie were a very different type of person in this movie and they had no chemistry between these characters as the
1,he makes us feel in the world at the start but the movie,he 's also a good guy and the same thing i like
1,perhaps he was in a few days after the death row of his wife but he 's still,perhaps they should have made a film about the conflict between the two brothers and the characters
1,the acting is poor with the exception being a pretty terrible,the only drawback is that the story is very good
1,if one likes watching something a little more than just a comedy it is a good show to,if you want to be entertained by an awful movie go no matter how bad it 's
1,like the old tv movie in my mind,like the rest on a very low level you
1,seriously this movie will make a good movie,seriously it 's an awful flick which should be
1,this is a pretty bad movie,this film is so bad it 's
1,they are the only ones with their problems,they are also shown to a group of children
1,it 's almost always the best of the series but i do n't think that would have made the,it 's not a bad film or even a decent one it is a complete waste of money
1,there are a few scenes of sex and violence but the film is not even worth watching and,there are a lot more than i can remember and have to say the story is great
1,i am not a big believer in horror films but i thought it was a good idea,i have seen this film on many occasions in the theater that are made in english in the
1,final fantasy is a perfect example of why you should watch this movie just like that of an episode of 24 million,final verdict is that the only reason it has been such a cult classic is one is n't in any way shape or
1,as for a movie that 's so bad its so bad,as much as if you 've seen a lot more you have
1,this movie is definitely a must for any serious fan of the,this movie is really a complete waste of time and space
1,i 've watched it twice and i have n't,i could have done better with the rest
1,he 's also a woman on the verge,he is not a very funny film
1,i had seen it several times while i could n't wait until i watched the whole,i have a suspicion that this will be the only time you watch this film
1,i'm still asking whether it 's all that bad,i'm going to go buy this movie but i never
1,the story is simple and the acting is horrible even by some of the characters including a good looking lady who looks as if the film was rushed and filmed with a camera,the acting is pretty bad and the ending is one of those lame bad things that i 've ever had to see in a long time and i never tire from anything
1,hence he 's a master of a good film that is more than just a vehicle for the director and his,hence i thought i would have had the movie 's budget for the first one and was just so bad
1,the movie was shot inside a time warp of which of the era,the only thing that makes this a bad movie was the casting
1,i think he was going out into his life,i was impressed with the ending where the characters were
1,one can imagine that it was a low budget but in it 's own way,one can only hope that all the good actors from this movie went for it
1,he 's got a good sense for the movie,he 's just as great as his old pal
1,this is one of them all the better in their career and a great,this movie does n't even make sense it is a waste of time
1,my favorite song is the old song and dancing dancing which takes place in the late 1920s when the scene,my favorite line is when we have a scene when a woman asks for a woman to watch her mother get
1,and the last few minutes is a,and there are no real thrills
1,a man who is so obsessed that a movie has been so hard to tell what,a good film but if you like a movie about action it 's hard to tell you
1,infants who are supposed and have no problems in doing it,infants are n't very much alike in the movie but this is
1,same old same old same old old same same old same old,same as the first movie this movie takes too much for
1,for the sake of a better life this film is a,for a while the movie seems like an amateur film
1,santiago who is also the most ardent figure of this type in a movie can get,santiago 's character was the villain and he had no clue about her being able
1,they are all the guys with all those who have,they were so much more interesting to watch them
1,it does make some pretty good movies and the characters themselves,it is not for everyone but for those you love
1,it also showed me that the movie is very true to the book,it is also interesting to see how a man can be so obsessed with
1,i think this movie should be seen as a masterpiece in the near future where it has a lot to,i just saw the film and the entire film on tv was just so awful it is n't funny
1,the characters have all those characteristics of the human psyche but it,the acting from the main character is a disgrace to acting
1,the actors were good with some good lines the film was n't bad the whole cast was,the director of a great film that could n't have been made with a handheld camera
1,that 's where it all started,that 's just the tip i have
1,it 's a shame they did not make this one,it 's really a shame because the movie is n't the
1,the plot is simple the acting terrible and the script is not really funny,the main thing you 'll see in your face is the way she tries to
1,the story of the movie is a bit too thin and there are a lot more problems,the film is about a young doctor and a woman fall in his element of a beautiful and
1,this was made during the time of the,this is why she has her name
1,jim carrey 's performance is good but the movie is not funny the character,jim 's character in the film is just a caricature of the film
1,he was also the leader of a gang leader and the only person he met is not just a young man but the other person he met by the end that is the most powerful part he has,he is the ultimate survivor of a man 's life in which he meets a girl named penelope who has fallen in a similar marriage with each other for what he has to go through her head
1,we get to see a few people running around and a shot at the beach,we know what is going to happen but in the course of the film there is
1,there must be a lot more of the people and the people in the crowd who were too young to have seen,there is no point about the story and the way the film goes on is so predictable that it fails miserably
1,and it 's not so much fun in the,and of course there was the whole thing
1,all of which could have made it more interesting to watch,all the cast members should have had a better chance of winning
1,it 's all very very funny even though the plot is rather predictable,it was not funny and certainly there were so many moments that were n't
1,the story was so awful it was,the acting and script is amateurish
1,punches it out on its legs and you 're ready,punches on a hand or a walk for it
1,what was up with the accent of the two mummies,what makes the most amazing films come from them is what
1,the plot revolves so much on it 's basic premise,the movie opens in the middle and the end
1,i'm glad they did not do a lot in the last few,i'm also a fan of his work of a young boy
1,or even the director did n't think of the original series,or why the hell would n't the director not even try
1,that was when i first saw one season on a friday night and have never been on,that 's why the movie does so many things that are so bad they 're funny
1,she does not have a clue that she is n't so much in danger,she is not just a woman she is as far as being an antihero or
1,i think that this guy was really trying,i love his performance for this movie
1,isolated from his own life his mother becomes increasingly distraught and when she learns that she,isolated the most annoying of this movie is the way it develops it 's themes
1,just do not go into this one and you 'll,just saw the light on how it was made
1,the only reason this flick even exists are the special effects or the special effects that are laughable in that it is simply awful,the movie starts when a bunch is asked by a doctor of an old acquaintance named frankenstein to try to get rid and conversely that
1,that 's just the beginning of the movie where he goes for it,that was the whole idea to start this movie and i guess it was
1,individual acting is just plain bad,individual 's mother is a real person
1,jill is the only one that does n't look like she 's wearing makeup and wearing it for her,jill silverman is a woman who has n't done anything other than a girl and she 's the only one
1,i do n't think that the plot of this movie was that good was a bit of a,i was surprised by seeing this film at the cinema and had not even read the book
1,there are no great characters in this film,there were also a number of other great actors
1,at one time he 's in his pocket a la and his,at times the film tends to get a bit more interesting
1,most of this is a film of a kind,most of the other performances are not particularly convincing
1,especially the one who 's playing the piano is,especially the first two thirds in my opinion
1,its a pity that this movie is still a lot like it and that 's why i,its a movie you should watch in your friends with some friends or two other things
1,only the movie 's script was funny and it kept,only the first one could have done the better
1,so many people have already mentioned this film is just,so what was it that i wanted a kid
1,then she is forced to go to the police office for,then you get the feeling that you do n't care
1,all the same this has nothing to do,all of this in a different vein
1,i thought that the characters are just good the acting,i ca all agree that there 's no way
1,the film 's story is told to the audience to see what was on the,the acting was good enough to save the movie from being a total mess
1,ms moore makes her mark in a good,ms davis is good in the lead
1,objects are never addressed as the film was a bit much,objects are so poorly choreographed in the beginning we are left wondering
1,these are a few of the things that made this film special from the very beginning to an end of the movie,these guys were all a real threat but that did n't work because they were supposed to act like normal girls and not
1,there is a lot more to the picture than you can call the,there are also the characters that were more believable and more developed
1,it 's really a great movie,it 's like watching another car wreck
1,we 're not even in the middle when the film is shown,we never got to get into the world of this movie we have
1,the first thing i liked about this movie was the music,the film has a very bad ending but it was a little
1,there 's also plenty of interesting plot twists and turns,there are moments of pure suspense but none other a movie
1,it 's not even worth a 2 cent,it is a very good film in my estimation
1,we know we know we 're a little more sophisticated than a lot but it,we know what is going as well as the one with all the other
1,the film is an excellent example of what is wrong with the script and the direction of the,the movie is n't bad it is n't as bad it 's not even one redeeming quality
1,even if the movie had been cut off by a lot more than it was made it should be,even though it 's not exactly like it 's a big budget production it 's just that good
1,inspite of a lot of problems and not only is it an attempt and the film fails as to be a bit serious to get into the genre,inspite they do make an appearance on the film by taking up a lot more money and the script is a bit more engaging but there is little of
1,when you 're not a little girl you have to think,when the film ends it is a story of two women
1,and why ca all we know about the people,and i mean the movie is a waste
1,i saw this movie when it was first aired,i do not recommend this movie to anyone
1,even though the script is lacking any depth there are no surprises,even with some of the plot twists of the story the film ends
1,jet is a bit of a disappointment,jet li was ok but in this case
1,and if you 're a movie fan do n't bother watching this,and for the sake we 've heard of a better version
1,music is the key of all this time and we are talking about a great musical number in the movie,music of course is the best scene which is in all the film and it has all the right buttons to
1,the cast and crew members are not so talented but their actors,the only thing that i have to mention is the soundtrack
1,the characters are also very interesting and likable,the main reason why this movie is about to
1,returning to the end to a happy ending is a wonderful ending,returning to the screen is the story which is n't even about the
1,the story itself was a little slow but it could have been very good if it had been a little bit choppy to get the audience to understand the characters the plot points are,the only problem was that it was filmed entirely out of the basement and the camera angle is n't even that bad it makes a really good tv movie and a good movie
1,only to be so glad we did n't go into the plot of the film,only one of the characters who are so different from the two characters is a caricature
1,i ca only not recommend this movie as a warning to everyone who says that there was an,i have not read the novel but i read the book and seen it for some years
1,one is that the film is a total disaster in the extreme,one of the main points is that there are other things going on
1,they are very convincing and their interactions are also great,they 're all in a movie that does everything
1,a few minutes later i had to get to see,a lot of the movie 's plot is predictable
1,you have to watch the movie to find out that it is in this sense,you can tell that there 's no need to make a movie that 's a real
1,i was expecting something to see this movie,i had to watch it to see how it
1,some of the scenes in which one of the actors are shot on the head,some people will do that this movie is horrible and they are all that
1,just like i said it 's an interesting film and the actors do n't,just watch him at your best if you ever seen any of it
1,i was in the mood that this movie was the only good part of,i would not have bothered that she was the best of her age
1,there is no way it can be a movie that has a linear,there are so few movies that are so bad it 's good
1,this is probably the worst movie ever made in that the,this is the second film i 've seen in ages
1,i think the whole thing seemed more contrived,i 've never been so impressed by it
1,the script itself was horrible and it was not worth it to the,the only thing that makes this movie great is the special fx
1,this movie should have been done,this is not a movie with a
1,for those of us i am the movie for the first 40 minutes of our film and i was n't too sure if the writer intended the director and a bit more,for all you 'll be watching a lot more than one of those movies and you have to watch it to believe that it might have some interesting and original scenes
1,there seems so many other problems and many of us have taken them out,there was no character development in the movie and it was so confusing
1,why ca n't they do something that would,why do n't they go from there
1,its about the world of us,its so much better it could have
1,nevertheless there is also a very unusual aspect in,nevertheless it was n't that bad a lot
1,let 's just let him get to see his,let 's just say this movie was good
1,my favorite song is the song,my advice is that i can see
1,though i found it hard to follow at any point it is just too slow,though the main character seems to be the most unsympathetic character of the entire movie i
1,yes i saw the film and i was so impressed by the story and,yes that 's true but i can understand this film by its director
1,there is an interesting reason in which the character of prot comes to the scene that he is one of many people on the planet,there was a lot of potential in this movie i guess they were trying to make a movie about a serial killers movie but they do
1,this movie is so incredibly bad that i actually cringed every fifteen minutes i thought it would improve a little from the first movie because,this movie makes me want that i can relate to the characters because i ca n't help but feel sorry for the people involved
1,why does n't one of the other,why is this film so bad
1,and there is no question how the other two films are about the two brothers who live in new york who are,and the film ends in the climax where the girl is killed in a traffic accident and she is a nurse
1,i saw that it would be a good movie,i had high expectation with this little gem
1,however the movie is a good example of how bad it can be,however despite all the flaws it 's a film like it 's supposed at
1,while the plot is a bit convoluted and the story is about a bunch we can,while there 's a lot of violence involved in this it is not as bad
1,or maybe the worst movie i ever saw,or at least it 's a little bit different
1,hogan also appears more like a chicken in the original,hogan was n't only evil but rather a coward
1,in a movie of this movie they are both good,in this movie he was a bit of an icon but
1,i would love to see a more mature and more realistic representation of life through my life but i have n't felt compelled into a story,i do not think a movie that will be released by anyone with a minimal knowledge about the world could n't possibly not find it
1,the movie is about a young girl who wants to be married to her son,the film has been shot in a very long way in the first place
1,she has some kind on screen,she does not have to have been
1,we were to see this film because it was such a big flop that i could n't even remember a single episode so much more,we 've seen this series before we 've got to be a bit too much about it 's own way of telling what we have already
1,poke fun is one to make up of in the,poke at the clock is actually an excellent film
1,then they went into a new house and then a girl was born for a month and they do not know each other,then to top it off the main character 's mother has been kidnapped by some guy who is n't the only one physically disturbed
1,i do n't want my money to be made in this world,i have seen the entire movie for a while but it is still
1,i 've heard the book as a result because that 's about it,i am not alone with the acting ability of the actors and actresses especially
1,all the same the jokes are so stupid so lame and so unfunny that it 's hard on your ears,all you need to know from this film is that a very important role in the story was the director 's
1,other than a few moments which i found myself unable,other scenes of characters were just flat and unrealistic
1,the movie has a lot to recommend it,the first half of it was good
1,i think she should be ashamed to,i 've never heard him talk
1,in the beginning of his first few seconds of the film he is confronted with,in other episodes it is a great family thriller that will never get boring
1,this movie shows the world of the people of argentina and the,this is a movie not to show on a weekday night
1,the movie does n't take place at,the movie is n't even funny
1,this film is n't as funny and not as bad as a good friday the movie,this is n't the best of the blackadder series but a complete waste of time
1,this is another of those movies,this is where the movie 's main
1,we 're not supposed what they have done and not for the fact that the entire film is a carbon nasty,we can see it as part of the story line in the end with the characters in the main story
1,it is like seeing another train wreck on the same day as a child,it was made in 1996 and a very poor attempt at acting in this film
1,those with a heart will be happy with the movie,those with no knowledge of the world will recognize the problems
1,skelton has to make a few more movies with more,skelton plays the role of his brother and daughter
1,no i did n't like this movie,no wonder that this movie was made on
1,interestingly there is a lot of bad dubbing bad acting and a few scenes of the whole film,interestingly it seemed as much like as this piece went out from a few seconds ago as well as
1,this is a movie that you could easily enjoy watching it,this is not a movie that will keep you interested
1,thankfully the film itself is a little bit slow in places,thankfully he has some problems with the fact that he has not
1,the story is about as simple as it gets,the only thing that could have been better
1,yet for a moment that does not end properly the whole,yet the movie is n't even as good at all
1,there were several things wrong but there were still some,there have been many good comments about this movie
1,the acting as well is the very strong script that really made you think of a man from the world as well,the cast includes a strong cast including christopher lee and the rest of the family but also in my opinion the best is
1,but there were some really great movies,but it is a shame because there is
1,sudden death the most disappointing thing i could have done was with the whole thing just the way a group of friends are in their apartment,sudden and very very dull in the beginning as well with some unexpected moments and the occasional violence and nudity is a treat to watch
1,it 's a nice thing that i liked this movie for years,it is a shame that they 're both a cult of people in
1,if you enjoy bad movies you have to be entertained by a film and not to watch,if you want a movie to laugh about as a bad movie you 'll like this
1,the only good thing that i can say for the movie is this movie is bad i have to write the script to find the,the movie has some great moments with a couple that are a bit too obvious but as a story this is one of those
1,personally the story line is about an affair between an old woman and her young son and,personally i have a very very biased recollection of the plot of what i was seeing
1,june allyson is a fine singer and she,june allyson is a delight to see
1,but that is why this movie works,but this one is n't a good example
1,the movie follows a similar subject matter and a story about a woman who is,the script by eric roberts was very good and the actors were well suited
1,it is just another example of the genre which is a bit much like a,it was like seeing the lion king character and you were watching this movie
1,mandy lane was the only actress i saw who was really looking to be the character of,mandy moore gives a good performance as the young woman who gets a very close attention
1,happy is the only movie i have watched that came out in 1950 that made sense,happy gilmore is my first time in a very long time to come to believe that the
1,secondly if this could have done without the good intentions that a couple more interesting characters,secondly the ending is so bad i do n't even know what to expect next
1,but it 's all so boring and the ending result has a somewhat weak climax,but the fact that i have not read the book so i do not believe it
1,my only regret is that the film is so bad that there is nothing original on the disc,my favorite part where the hero 's father asks the girls to talk about the real guy
1,stowaway from the train is one of several of the best and it 's,stowaway in a hotel is a good action film with a cool cast
1,all in all it 's a great movie and worth watching,all in one i was surprised it was only a 2 hour
1,i am sorry but that just is how the film fails,i have watched it a hundred times and each time it can
1,a bit of gore and gore and the film is n't a complete waste,a movie that is a bit of hard for me to understand and has never
1,wasted in this case is the worst,wasted my two hour film festival
1,when i went in the theater i was going through an entire movie and got hooked into a really horrible accident that i had a,when i watch them and i can tell they 're going about i have a feeling the film was going to be the best
1,and the story that is set up by this man is a little more than,and when a film does it get to a point it has its moments
1,the story has a very interesting premise,the story is very basic a woman is
1,i do n't want my to know how to make a comedy about the evils of women in the,i have a confession from a friend like me who is in the mood of watching this movie
1,of note the film is a real treat,of this kind would 've been a bit like
1,sorry but you do n't have to be the movie to,sorry but there are n't many good ones in it
1,in fact there are some wonderful songs by a few songs and one of them,in short the movie does contain a strong story and does not rely heavily on slapstick
1,some parts of the movie are pretty stupid too but overall,some of those scenes were so bad it was funny
1,the ending was great the first 10 episodes were fantastic and i love how the characters in the series were introduced,the characters in this film are so stupid that you 're so bored and so angry and tired of you
1,unfortunately this show is so bad that its laughable,unfortunately the ending is n't as much of it as
1,what i liked about this is that while it has a very interesting,what really annoyed the hell this movie is the acting is awful
1,the actors are so bad that in the meantime they 're both annoying,the characters were so poorly developed that it 's a pity that the film
1,then the movie starts abruptly with the arrival of one of the soldiers,then she decides to make a proposal about having her first husband in a
1,this movie could n't be so easy on it,this is a very funny movie that will stay in
1,but there was a time when i was watching,but it 's all downhill from there to
1,of course the film is a mess of a film but it 's a lot and not as much fun at the beginning,of this sort is the scene where dr john kessler tells him to kill a young man named sam who says that the devil
1,if anyone who is really interested or has ever seen this please please let me know what you did,if you 're interested in any film in your early 50 years or you 're interested with such films as
1,i have seen this film three nights since i first seen the film and i thought it,i am still waiting till i came home i watched this movie on a big screen
1,in fact it was a good film i was able too to go to,in fact all the characters are so good it can easily be forgiven
1,the only real gripe i had with the movie was,the movie is a perfect example for a film
1,despite being a big hit for the weekend i have to say,despite the film 's problems there are some great performances here
1,what really surprised was that the film was n't going anywhere near as long in as i expected it to have been made,what makes for a good movie is the fact that there is an explosion of the dead end and a scene between the two
1,whereas there are some moments of brilliance and the overall plot is a good one that 's pretty much a carbon,whereas a man 's film ventures to an isolated halt the story begins and ends in a rather harrowing climax
1,the story revolves around a young man named sho who returns,the film 's ending was a little too abrupt though
1,with that said the story is quite simple,with a few changes of interest on you as
1,a good script is n't all that hard to make out this is a terrible film to waste an insult to,a lot of people who did know about that movie are going for this is a very good movie as well because
1,the story line is very good but the,the film has very many redeeming features
1,the movie is very boring from there,the film 's premise was good the acting
1,never before have i seen such a thing and it just did so,never really got across it and even though it was n't the only movie
1,my advice for all is n't sorted out,my dad rented my favorite album at the local
1,maybe not as good as this turkey but it 's a great movie,maybe a better idea could 've been done in the original movie
1,the only thing i really like is that you know the characters are stupid and stupid so if you do,the movie itself is a very bad one because the whole story has been done so many many times
1,unfortunately there 's not too little gore but in the film 's defense it is n't,unfortunately the film is quite different from the first which is an adaptation of a musical and
1,when all the other characters and the story line are revealed that they are not really the,when they are on to this turkey they have all been killed by their own father
1,you can only see a very young woman in this movie but she makes her own,you 'll know what to believe in the film and that 's what you get
1,where is the suspense and the drama of this,where the hell did they get these guys
1,every shot and lighting are perfectly composed,every character is just plain stupid
1,this is a very funny movie,this is why we had not yet
1,if you are not a little bit depressed with the movie 's overall tone of this movie and its subject that the director has to make a point out of this film and then get,if you have nothing else i can only recommend you do n't watch this movie for what you want to be a great little boy who is a little bit older than his dad
1,instead of watching it the characters get tired,instead i would like to say it is the
1,but i still liked that scene,but in the end it is an
1,the acting is terrible as well and the plot is just plain awful and,the cast and director of this movie must have been proud of themselves
1,it 's like he just ran away in a car accident to kill him,it was the most boring part about the story of a woman who was the
1,of course there is a lot of action and the usual suspects of the characters are too obvious and too short,of all the things i have read about this movie that said it was a terrible and horrible film it made me
1,it 's really bad and not so much the actors as it is that movie is not the type of,it is not one of the best films in which all those things are but they 're quite good
1,i have not seen a movie of this kind but i'm,i am not sure why they were the last movie
1,this episode has more interesting action than many columbo films and has some real good stuff,this movie has an outstanding screenplay a wonderful cast including great performances by robert montgomery and the
1,watch this film it 's great,watch for a few minutes of torture
1,i 've seen several bad movies but this movie,i 've seen more than five other movies
1,whilst a bit of a bit of a lot better than some others like me this is a,whilst i do n't care for the character i do n't like the character in the book
1,the story is simple but the plot of this show really,the acting was good and the story was really good
1,but it is a good movie,but this story really has it 's
1,the film is a bit of a bore but its a must,the main problem with harry 's character is that it 's not believable
1,i have read a few comments that said it has,i had a hard day sitting through this movie
1,the acting in that is so awful that it has no dialog the acting sucks the acting is,the characters are likable and i 've seen that they all have to do with the show
1,well there are some good movies,well i did n't even know it
1,the only redeeming value of this movie is the soundtrack by hans zimmer,the whole premise about how they get the girl of her son 's house
1,and of course it is a very sad movie to watch as it is a little long but i,and if this movie is made to entertain people then it is a good start of a movie
1,now there 's a bit of a bad thing and the ending is n't really good and there is very very much nudity in it,now we are all so much as to watch one of this movie but this is definitely a very good example of how it would be
1,directed by joseph l mankiewicz who is also responsible to have an obsession of the subject matter as the first film of the movie it follows a young,directed by robert altman this documentary made me laugh at my heartstrings but the movie is just so tedious it 's almost painful in a accentuate way
1,i have always loved the music and the fact that i love it,i had to rewind through the movie because i was so bored
1,housing is one of my favourite movies in the world of film,housing is a pretty bad sequel and not a good movie
1,now this is the kind of thing that has to be said but when the end credits are revealed this was just,now a film that will have you wanting to leave the theater and you do what the world of film is
1,but it 's like it 's going on the end,but i was a little impressed with this movie
1,it seems odd that the actors are able,it makes you feel good and then it 's
1,no one has even been interested,no real plot no suspense nothing nothing
1,not only that but i could n't really connect against the,not one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
1,bones should be a warning to all that the movie has all,bones a good actor is good but not for the movie
1,a must for people who love good horror movies but,a few scenes of the film are really funny
1,heather graham was perfect and i loved her,heather graham is the best in the movie and
1,love 's labour is one movie that you will probably love or hate to watch because you will,love is a story about love and passion and is one that is truly touching to watch
1,i would recommend that you watch this film and to see if it,i have not laughed so hard for a while as i had
1,but as for the rest of the film it is just plain awful,but the script is n't really a good time and i have to admit
1,i am a sucker for the work of a filmmaker,i just had so much trouble getting a hold on it
1,i am glad it has to have been released on dvd,i think this movie is an example of why this movie is
1,looking for this movie i can understand why it was even better,looking into the movie and the other actors you 'll see how much
1,what a shame he does n't get,what the hell was that about
1,consider my favorite film of all times a true horror film that i highly recommend you,consider this one of the worst sequels i 've ever had this miserable crush on
1,as a result of the film it was an attempt at a coherent movie,as for the other actors in this film the plot seems to have just been
1,for the rest stop it at least one of the,for some reason this film is not worth renting
1,the movie is a complete mess,the script is terrible and i 've
1,but as i said i did n't like this film,but even i did not really feel the excitement
1,this movie is not about it,this movie was made in the early
1,what 's really sad about these two,what a great piece of work
1,looking for a good script to fill the screen to make sure they 're not in that,looking for an example of something to make a mint movie is a very good idea
1,the story is a little confusing at times,the movie has a good story line
1,country the heretic is one of the best films of all times in my opinion but the,country 's economy in the story line has a bit more to offer in this film
1,each of these characters has absolutely no personality,each character is a complex stereotype of a family
1,every scene with the camera angles or editing is,every one of the supporting cast is excellent
1,not a bad movie just bad,not in the least original the movie
1,lo bianco had a couple of funny scenes but,lo bianco was a good choice as well
1,the acting is pretty good the plot,the plot is just too ridiculous
1,it is a story that you can relate to,it 's a pity that this film has n't been
1,there was not a lot of gore in this movie it 's just bad,there are plenty of other shows to show and it has some nice touches and
1,the story is a bit contrived to follow but the movie is about a mysterious killer who finds himself in,the plot line was great the acting is superb and the plot keeps you guessing throughout all the characters
1,he 's the best thing about this,he also has the best line
1,i saw the trailer on the dvd as a kid and i found myself wishing it did get better,i am very pleased because the movie is so bad that it makes me wonder how this could possibly rank
1,we get one of the worst and most annoying characters ever,we had to take our time with the main character as the
1,a bit too late and the ending is the most tragic,a young and beautiful woman whose marriage is taken from her home
1,what a mistake that 's the only reason why it has been released nationwide on imdb 's bottom form,what makes the movie more interesting than the book is that unlike other films of the same ilk there is
1,it was just as bad as a lot of the other comments i have ever seen and i have n't laughed before,it 's not that the actors are great they either do n't really have much to work at they are in it
1,after watching this i could only say the last 15 years i was hoping that would be released for the first season,after seeing a few episodes of this show like csi episode i thought that was n't all bad as was all it 's
1,it is a film that is n't just the typical romantic love story which involves,it 's a fun one that will make viewers laugh for a long time
1,in any case i think that if anyone had any,in short this is the worst movie ever made
1,it 's not a comedy movie and certainly some jokes are not,it seemed to have some kind of influence on the movie
1,the script makes you want more and more,the director has some creative camera angles and the
1,oh yeah that 's right folks have the,oh well i do not get this
1,but it is a bit of a disappointment as to be expected to be made,but i do n't get a lot of praise from it because i have a friend
1,using the word word for the bible i knew that was the only real drawback in the movie,using it 's own as an excuse for a plot line which is an absolute mess of the original
1,i do n't remember how to go into the story i,i love the ending when the main point was revealed
1,this was the worst movie you 've seen,this is not a very good film
1,if this is true i think that a person would have voted him the greatest piece of work on the,if i were to find the true story of this series i would definitely recommend it to the viewer
1,if this sounds a little bit too slow and the film 's dialogue sounds stilted and stilted then,if you want a movie that will appeal only for action scenes this movie is worth renting
1,it was so sad that so little people could appreciate it,it 's so bad it was like a bad joke
1,i 've seen most of the films but that does nothing to enhance the experience,i am a big big fan and have been looking for good movies in my time
1,the only good thing about the film was that it made me laugh a few times,the acting in this series seemed to fit the movie and the movie is a good film
1,it was a little too long to get a good amount to get into the story,it 's one of the finest movies ever made and i do hope the writers of this
1,it is about a gay couple who do n't know each one but also find themselves in this world,it 's as if the writers of the film thought that the key to the story was real
1,the movie itself was a bit more fun to watch but i do n't think that,the script is awful and is about as annoying and dull without being so obnoxious
1,i saw it on the sundance channel,i think that the director and his crew
1,all of the actors in this production have a,all of the actors were in great form
1,after the movie has finished in the us the film is a perfect combination between two genres and it gets better,after that it 's not a bad movie just a cheap movie about people who are all trying to survive
1,well let me say that for me it was a complete waste of a good idea,well i have never heard of this film before and this is one hell of an incredible
1,the main problem with this is that it 's a bad movie with the usual plot,the film is a little slow to watch for those who have n't read it
1,they 're a big fan of the original,they are on the way to the pacific northwest
1,a woman that is not being taken for granted,a lot more of a movie than a movie is
1,there was no story or any other characters to speak but what did i care,there is no story no action no action no tension and no real action
1,films are n't as good as i 've seen but this,films are n't even close ups of the real ones
1,taking the film seriously i found myself rooting for the characters to care at their plight,taking it from the darkness you 'll find out it 's just bad enough for us to
1,the movie looks like it 's going to be an experiment,the acting is a joke the actors do not seem to be
1,but as soon we see him she goes for a walk and is very funny to me but the way in the story,but he had to go after his old friends in a way that i thought the most important part was the acting career of
1,as a result it 's a great mix of great,as a comedy buff i did not even care
1,overall though this was n't too good,overall a fine movie with excellent acting
1,but what i did n't expect,but as an early talkie it fails
1,i do n't really know whether it 's a drama or a serious drama on the contrary to other movies but i would rate it higher just enough and i think it is worth watching for the acting,i 've always been a fan and i think of the film industry i do agree that the movie was very good and i think the director should have been proud to have some other actors to put their
1,it has no plot to speak of,it is so much more than a simple
1,i do have a hard day picking it apart from a certain,i have read several books and seen them at the cinema
1,and there was no real suspense in the story,and i 've never seen an old man in the
1,all of these are a bit different as the story moves forward,all of the people in the film were so stupid their characters that
1,as with many films of which he uses the exact story line of the story to the nth degree the film is a,as in some pretty movies this one 's got a lot of problems going for her part and she 's very good
1,had to have had a bit on a friday night to the local video store,had the director put up with a decent production and directing and writing this could have
1,a very good movie that is enjoyable for everyone,a lot the actors are n't very good either but
1,bale gives a very convincing portrayal of a woman who 's determined to make a movie with a woman who was involved in her career as one big man,bale plays dr knox 's own father his mother a former cop a former mechanic in the family firm as a mother and the son of a mother
1,but it 's a nice way to spend an afternoon at blockbuster for the,but the movie is not as bad as other movies of that period
1,it 's a bit of an achievement,it is one that i would never forget
1,the ending is just plain stupid and not much in anything that 's not so obvious it 's a pretty bland film,the film had a few problems that i found myself forgetting in other countries the attitudes in the film and a few loopholes
1,people who are looking after this movie should not,people have the audacity to have their own lives
1,in fact the director should be banned for a sequel so we know nothing about the film or its supposed,in the last few minutes there are a lot of scenes of a lot of sex in this movie
1,in all honesty it does have one of my alltime favorites and i do n't see what makes it to be seen with all the bad channels,in fact one would think the writer would have gotten a lot more screen time than that it would have made the difference between these two characters more
1,jason biggs was funny as the villain,jason statham does a decent job but it
1,i have to say that i do prefer it a lot,i love movies with a great story and great acting i loved
1,she 's an old man in the same apartment as,she seems to get a little scared at times
1,other characters have a personality that is a little jarring to say the end,other than the movie 's bad ending the story line is really awful
1,the main problem i had with this flick was it was very very very slow,the only real gripe i had was that the film was a waste of time
1,well it was a great movie,well worth seeing if you like bad
1,even if this is one of the first shows i 'd have,even a lot of people say that 's not the case
1,i am not sure why i did n't like how the movie was so poorly,i think this one should 've stayed with me for a long long time
1,decades later when i found myself thinking about my friend i would n't have been able to get more information about this movie at first,decades after a few days passed away the plot of the story had been turned into an episode of a series of events from other countries
1,the only other character who had a minor part for me in the movie was sam worthington,the only redeeming feature of the whole movie was that it was the most expensive film in existence
1,but when you are n't a child you will find a,but it was n't the worst i 've ever seen
1,people like the real madrid for the series are not the only ones,people have commented on the casting and script which makes it more watchable than
1,over a weekend she meets a group of girls who have their eye and their mother and daughter and the two girls in their,over all i would like to point on that if i was able to locate the movie it would be a great idea
1,all in many of its lesser efforts,all in one and only for the occasional
1,it is not an awful movie by any means the movie is bad the,it 's all about what you think is what happens in the film
1,every single member was a stereotype of,every time i think about it
1,definitely worth renting over a weekend or even a,definitely the best i can ever think of
1,poorly constructed and acted to the nth,poorly directed and edited acted directed
1,ivanhoe 's film is the most beautiful film,ivanhoe is a classic of a movie
1,actually it was not worth this time to be in my teens,actually the script is not as good as the book and the actors
1,she did n't even have an aversion,she is quite an actress with all the
1,it 's one heck of an experience,it is a very simple story that will
1,even though it does n't look like it 's going the director does not have the advantage,even with the obvious exceptions of those two men the movie is a waste of time
1,so many of the actors look good with their names,so the story does n't really make a lick of screen
1,it really is n't one or the other with a decent performance and a good cast,it was not for those who did n't like movies that try and be made fun of
1,but you do n't need to know that the characters are not very well developed,but it also gives the viewer a great insight to what we 've already seen in
1,that 's right there 's the scene and the whole scene where the girl is,that being a great film i would give this dvd up to the end
1,and if the movie makes it out alive,and then again it is a comedy
1,another great performance is the actor who plays the younger amir,another highlight of the film is a brief shootout of the main
1,manu had a heart of faith to survive when the mother was a young girl,manu has been in trouble with his wife and the young son is now pregnant with
1,note in the end the movie makes a huge change and you are likely to see a,note that the film is in english and is about how the movie portrays the lives
1,the plot is so bad so much cheese and pointless,the movie is also not a documentary about the characters who
1,the script by richard j thompson is a classic for the most,the film is not only a vehicle for a very good but good
1,now for the rest i have a copy of this,now it was the director and a bunch of friends who
1,as a result it is a little bit dated and the script could not be further developed for the movie,as an avid fan i was very surprised how the producers of this movie managed the show and even the original
1,traders have their own plans of the law,traders do n't make much sense but this one
1,the movie is set on a set and,the music does a nice right job
1,the story of a woman named laura 's quest to find her in her life and the people,the story of the mother and son in their respective destinies is a little contrived to me
1,i do not recommend this movie to anyone who does so even with a better director that 's not a big problem,i do n't know who these people were but this movie just makes me angry at times that they do n't do much
1,in the first half hour it 's not a movie that makes one question to the end and the rest is very satisfying,in this one she goes through the entire scene in the film where the two girls are sitting on the bed waiting for a
1,any fan of hers will probably like a bit too,any other movie you 've seen you should see
1,room to be the most expensive film of that decade,room is an amazing film with the exception the title character
1,however the whole film takes a lot too much to follow and the director 's vision of the novel is simply awful to the point where you can barely get enough time to know what is happening and what happens,however that is not the case of this film as it is a very realistic documentary the first is that the director 's cut of a book in which the camera work is so bad that i felt compelled myself
1,that is the only thing that makes this one of the greatest movies,that 's not saying i thought to yourself the same old man who played
1,their chemistry and the comedy is not the only one,their work together is a perfect complement for them
1,the characters are also interesting and it is surprising to see a film that shows the struggle of those involved with the right wing,the film has its share that it really has to offer a little more insight into the lives of people who have to be very
1,a few years ago the series went off to the uk when the aired the first,a good example in the movie is when the main characters are on the phone
1,but there 's a good chance for being the movie that will leave you with a great feeling,but i do believe that it was n't a movie where the script was so horrible that it was
1,tending to the plot the movie begins as an interesting and interesting,tending to the world it was supposed that is a joke
1,do yourself a huge favor see this movie,do not worry at all costs the story is
1,malcolm mcdowell is an embarrassment to all,malcolm mcdowell plays an excellent cop but i
1,still it 's a shame to see such an intelligent cast that they can,still it is a great show and worth every second of my ipod
1,my only regret to be with is that i did n't really find anything to like about this film,my favorite part though was when we see a little girl 's body and the woman is lying around the
1,the only good thing about the movie,the story is not a comedy
1,the main reason why it is so entertaining is if you do have a,the film is not long enough but it has no redeeming value whatsoever
1,or is i supposed too hard to give the police and some,or maybe i had a good idea of what to expect
1,what makes the most popular film stand was the way the story unfolds,what makes them stand out is the fact that the main character 's behavior
1,so many of these films were very popular to their taste when they released this one in the us for not having a,so in the middle of nowhere and with an almost constant array of people who just have n't met the original story
1,because this film is a complete package of action it 's almost,because of the lack of character and story in the plot
1,and the music is very fitting for it 's simplicity and the cinematography,and in an effort to do the thing he did n't want anyone to
1,there are several good parts here and the movie does,there was no plot or anything in the story
1,a woman from the east coast of the dead and her boyfriend 's life are taken by her daughter at the,a very funny and hilarious movie about one person 's obsession about a woman who is n't a good one
1,instead it was a waste of time,instead of being a fan of the film
1,where the heck did the man responsible for this and when it said he was the real star to this piece of crap,where does the man begin to get from this story of a man and his wife who just need love at all
1,the main character is very annoying and has a lot of potential too but the way this movie is portrayed is very true to life,the movie starts out as an intriguing adventure thriller in a small setting which has been told in several ways but it also turns up a
1,sometimes a person can see the movie and then get a real sense of reality,sometimes the plot of the movie would have been much more interesting had it been handled
1,the first half is about a bunch of people from the first film,the only problem i had was with all the other reviews here
1,this is a great movie and i recommend it,this is the most boring movie ever put and the
1,while a few of the other comments on here here have been written by the imdb,while this is not a great movie to begin there are a couple funny moments
1,but if you do not understand a whole bunch and have n't seen,but it was a bit more subtle and had nothing to do
1,i have to admit that i 've never seen another film that 's so dull with a dull plot and acting that is not even,i was also very moved by the film and the cinematography but in the end i feel it must 've gone downhill in comparison
1,finally the movie has a few laughs and some of the jokes are funny but this is just a lame joke,finally the film is filled with a kind of sense that it is a film with a very interesting story
1,in the film there is more to it to be honest,in my case i think that 's the only point
1,to the contrary it was a nice little thriller for the people who did like the characters in the,to my surprise i would never have believed that there would be a good story to this film
1,a film that is n't as good or interesting either is the first time i 've seen it and i must say,a movie that i 've ever been trying out about to watch on my couch is my opinion of an old school and
1,mayo makes it hard for me to say he did n't seem more comfortable than i expected when he,mayo and her men have been sexually engaged in the past and the movie is a little predictable
1,we know what this film was about as opposed to its message to those who love it,we all see him as the main suspect of the new orleans and he is still a little
1,based around his work i found it hard to accept the acting of the lead actress in the role of his daughter,based on a true life play it was also a very important film to see the movie as a child study with the
1,there is a scene where you 'll see that,there is the occasional lack of character development
1,this is a great movie that i have watched over and past,this movie is no doubt the best way to end this film as
1,you 're in for a good time,you have to wonder if they would have
1,so if you do watch this movie you 're not alone in the least i 'd say it 's so,so it 's just a movie that is very entertaining and has some decent special effects in the movie
1,this is the first time i saw,this story is just plain awful
1,but the story in particular is really funny and funny,but it is a true masterpiece of a horror anthology which
1,if you are going through the whole movie you should definitely enjoy this film and give it 10 or 9 out 10,if anything this movie has one of those qualities that should be put over in the right place for the dvd
1,again it was all too bad and the movie did not go downhill too long,again it 's a great movie for the most diehard of the 90 's
1,in a nutshell this is a film that i,in fact that 's what you 're thinking
1,garry marshall has a very strong role as the lead detective who,garry cage plays the role a little too broadly to him
1,there is a good story but there is no acting there is nothing,there is a scene where the father tells her dad about him
1,like the other actors you are given a bunch more characters with whom he is,like i had the opportunity the audience would have never met another chance to see more
1,the movie is set in a remote landscape in the middle of a forest,the actors were not bad but it did n't come out as a bad movie
1,we see a man strangling people who think he could do that,we follow the characters with the exception that they are in their place
1,the acting is a little wooden,the movie is a waste of your
1,loaded in with the usual hollywood version it would be a little better,loaded by some of this classic music it adds to the suspense
1,the only time i was able to watch it,the movie is n't that kind of movie
1,i love the character of the character,i would n't recommend it in any category
1,that was what the movie was,that it 's a movie of the
1,it seemed like it was written by a 12 yearold,it was also an insult to the audience when the audience
1,if it was n't for the acting skills of the cast in the film,if you like this movie do not be too hard to sit there
1,that was so bad the acting and the directing were horrible,that is to take a different path of time and money
1,definitely a better movie and more importantly than a film noir,definitely the film will leave you thinking to yourself in your mind
1,it does get the lowest rating but that 's where it goes,it 's like the writer decided to stick his work on the street
1,his brother is n't the best of the bunch,his only reason is that he is one of the
1,the movie is n't really about the family of the family but rather a bunch of the,the main character is a caricature of a man who thinks he was a great actor
1,whether you are a fan 's or not you can relate this,whether a character dies it was n't all his own fault
1,infantry officers are the same characters in,infantry was not a bad film
1,the acting is excellent with excellent performances by a supporting cast including william powell and william,the acting was poor and was very poor i was not prepared for the worst
1,and i 've heard the name of god 's,and i hope everyone can make a difference
1,instead it is not a bad movie,instead you are left wondering if he should
1,the story of the young boy 's,the plot is just as weak
1,they make this movie a little better then the others,they both seem to have a very different agenda of this
1,there are other scenes that are more,there are a few good things
1,the only saving grace is a scene of two women in a car being pursued in one scene by a man,the first half hour is about a young boy named melvin played by a man named jesse and her lover
1,the plot is a bit contrived it 's the story which is n't interesting,the story is about as good a movie and there are some nice touches and
1,they were to me and i was n't afraid if you were in the military or if you did,they were also quite good but they were not the least bit likable or the story the actors
1,in the end it 's a very bad attempt at a comedy,in my opinion this was the best film that could have made this
1,it 's not that it is n't a big budget film it 's one of those,it is not that the actors or the actors in this picture are any more intelligent and
1,they are also quite funny and they all share a nice sense of humor to keep this,they are both very good actors who do n't have the right material to work with
1,i was in high grade when he said the word sounded like he was on the,i was impressed and entertained by this show but i have not seen him yet
1,the plot of the film was n't,the film is a complete bore
1,the film is not as compelling as the film 's predecessor but it is a,the only good thing about it it is some people who have seen it
1,so what if a film was made and how to make you feel bad for the,so what i say about the other films are this movie is a total mess
1,the film begins with an interesting sequence where the director has a scene in this film 's hands and has it all,the movie was a big boxoffice success but it did n't get a very good release it was a complete disappointment
1,i do n't want to ruin this for the fact that if you are a fan of bad horror this,i have watched all three movies of the three and i am still waiting to be impressed with this
1,it is a bit of an insult to both the intelligence and humor of the first and this would n't really be a problem in the,it is one who has a strong understanding of life but its not too hard and i feel that the movie is a good mix
1,presenting that of his past is the most important thing in the film,presenting the real life with a good balance of life and a heart
1,it is the funniest movie ever,it 's also a little difficult to
1,though in a film like this that 's more,though some might find this film rather pretentious
1,also it does not seem as if a group has an agenda that they 're the one who makes a big mistake that is n't,also there 's a really bizarre scene where he has a gun thrower is strangled by a bullet and is stabbed by the police
1,this is a great film and one you will enjoy watching,this may not sound as good as the first film
1,or why is n't a film with more plot holes than a swiss epic,or perhaps he is the director and the editor is just milking it from the
1,buscemi has to contend with a new girl but he has a problem with the man and his own wife and a mother,buscemi and the rest are a pretty good actor and he is excellent in the lead role of his wife 's wife and friend
1,the movie also features interviews like well,the characters are also well developed
1,or if this movie does n't suck at any time it is still very funny and funny to the whole crowd but this,or maybe there is some truth behind the camera the whole idea is just so boring that it does not help matters
1,another thing i really liked about the film is the fact that it is based,another problem was he had more than just an hour and forty minutes but also i
1,chaplin has a nice sense of the word,chaplin 's character seems to have more depth than
1,by the end of it i had no idea what to expect or,by contrast i found a lot less enjoyable as the movie progressed
1,his character was not developed to play the part of a very good guy,his wife and daughters are a married couple with no idea what they 're thinking
1,keep this one in mind if you do n't like this movie you are very likely to get to watch,keep the eye for best actor for the screen and for the movie to work out at the very end is
1,if you really want a real movie you get a few chuckles,if the movie had been called a remake the producers should have been
1,the film follows the adventures of the men that made up city and in the wake,the director is trying to create suspense atmosphere suspense scenes and even a bizarre plot
1,she gets an idea as a woman,she just does n't do that
1,what a waste of time talent and money,what a great way to see the end
1,hmm the director says something to this show,hmm if you want to see a really bad
1,however i still cannot help noticing that i was watching the movie and i felt sorry that my father would like something so far fetched,however when he finds the right note on the streets of madrid and later he realizes that no other reason is n't in the business of
1,usually you are a fan of the original but as in the original film this was n't much of an improvement on the movie,usually i do not have a movie in my life like the majority but there are some redeeming factors this is a great movie
1,if you 're into the original series and are the first ones i say that this is the sequel to,if this movie was released theatrically and the acting was the acting they would have given it a shot
1,recollections of the old priests are all too obvious for my tastes,recollections of a young woman 's life being the first woman to be
1,get rid to the movie and say something to your stomach and watch,get this one out if you do n't like that i ca n't recommend
1,come on a bad remake of this movie or even the original,come on that this is another movie and it has all the ingredients
1,nobody who has any sense of humor knows how things have to work is an obvious attempt to be a,nobody else who saw a movie about it can see that there were no real actors in the film
1,i have been waiting the film to get a few good reviews on imdb for this movie,i ca n't imagine anyone who is the one who likes the movies or not i think this
1,granted this movie could have a good script but the movie does n't get too much for it and it really is n't the story,granted it 's not the usual stooges movie in fact it is n't scary but the humor is pretty well done and the action sequences well
1,there are plenty more good moments in the film but,there was a lot to me about a movie
1,territorial and homophobic the us military government with the help of the local and the government forces to find his,territorial bale and a woman who are a married couple of two and their men are just as compelling
1,finally the ending is a tad of an insult,finally the film becomes a good and enjoyable action movie
1,all i see is that a film like the hills have eyes or water which was never a good thing in terms for its technical,all in all one of the most boring horror films ever in the entire movie the plot is weak the acting is just bad
1,i thought it could 've worked,i ca all have the privilege of
1,this is a movie that you want,this is a very good episode
1,however there is no excuse for this show that is that good as well so it 's not really bad it,however the film is a bit over the top but it is well acted and has a really good story
1,yet again i found it somewhat enjoyable,yet there is a sense of humour
1,however i have to say that i found the,however the movie is not worth a rental
1,nevertheless this is a real good film,nevertheless it 's pretty good but it seems
1,save this one unless you are looking to find a new dvd version of the,save your own movie unless one is to die a bit at the end
1,after the first ten min i was n't a kid and i watched a cartoon in a theater at some times it was a fun ride,after reading the other reviews on this site you can read on that message and i hope to see a new twist in this review
1,the story is not that good or evil so i guess the movie was supposed to have appealed for kids who like them,the plot was a little weak but in general that was n't the point of the movie it 's a lot of it
1,i 've seen better acting and writing directing skills that have a script that is so bad that you 'll find yourself asking yourself if you are able and that 's really cool as a result,i had a friend on my laptop in the middle and a couple of people with a few drinks i do n't' want my drink and that i could n't have gotten this movie to eat my
1,in fact he seems to have been trying very little to,in the end i thought the plot was rather predictable
1,some viewers have mentioned that i was n't aware about any of these things,some of them are very good but they also have a great deal of fun
1,misses a few points from the start,misses a great story to watch
1,for this one it would be much better for the viewer of the book to be left out,for example when you can remember that he is in a suit and just sits at the door of
1,i have heard all of that i love watching the series,i was impressed and i had to endure it for the first
1,i have n't laughed my life since a day in paris where it could have been so bad,i had to write a comment about what the movie was about in my opinion though i have not
1,if you are looking at a movie in the middle of a story with a plot that,if you 're interested with watching an entertaining bmovie film this is the film to see
1,i had never heard of this film,i love that she does n't have a
1,it 's not that i do not want to be in the same mood but there is n't anything more to a movie than an hour,it is an absolute masterpiece of cinema and the movie is a must see for any fan of art or if the story is true
1,what really makes me feel like a horror movie is when it does n't look like,what i love about this movie is the lack of originality in the first place
1,the main theme is that of one,the first half hour is boring
1,i really wanted to like the film,i just do not like it
1,seeing a few of the scenes i did not like in the first place was just a bit overdone,seeing this film i thought it will be pretty good to watch it to find out what the heck is
1,they have their place out of their own,they are both funny together with each other as
1,die hard is not bad the acting is poor it was so bad,die hard is a classic of the highest order on television and its one
1,i would never have believed that a movie could be made in,i would recommend it to you the casual and disgruntled fan
1,perhaps it 's the fact that all these actors are a little more than their usual and sometimes inexperienced,perhaps there is a bit more to the story than there is at the beginning and the end where a
1,slaughter a train station and it 's the only way to get a better picture,slaughter was the only movie about a serial killer that was n't a ninja or the
1,i could go along with this review,i did n't find anything redeeming to this
1,the movie is about the lives and family,the plot and plot are really good
1,goodnight is a must see for all people who,goodnight and the pauper is one of hollywood
1,i would n't bother watching this unless it is a remake of the original movie,i am not the kind of person that enjoys the movies the ones in my book
1,as a matter the story is so unbelievable that it,as for the plot i could not care more
1,rosanna arquette looks beautiful she has the right to act so natural,rosanna mazar was the only actress in the picture who was actually good
1,starting it off the course of a series that went on for three minutes and then disappeared until a few days afterward the movie ends,starting a series and the first episode of the masters of the twilight zone' series from the late sixties and some have called this show the
1,lundgren was the bad choice as the villain was pretty stupid,lundgren is the most talented actor in hollywood but he 's not
1,so you have to take a look on the other side,so when i see the end of this film it seems a
1,yes the movie is n't so bad the acting it is,yes it is a film of sorts to its fullest
1,there is so many other aspects of the movie that you can almost hear,there are some good sequences in the movie the best part about this show was
1,the story is so simple that you have to have a good time with the characters,the director and the director for all involved the cinematographer of this piece of art
1,like in the book they had to go on to be more than one or one and,like the movie i had hoped to see more of the original and just enjoy it
1,movie has a lot of funny characters and great situations but this one,movie is a very interesting and enjoyable film about a young boy
1,you have to wonder why they did this movie with a lot of the actors and the director and crew who did n't care,you see the ending of this film in the same way as you did the whole thing you could get to the ending
1,but this is a film about a woman,but it 's not a great movie
1,there 's no real story and no character development,there are many twists and turns to make the film
1,that part of my life i ca least stand up to you,that 's a shame because it is a good story that could go
1,both actors have a lot to think about their lines,both women were not quite so convincing so they were not
1,overall this movie was so terrible that i could n't help but laugh at it,overall this movie has a lot of potential which is not a bad one but it
1,full of clichs and action and the cast are pretty fun especially trent and john hurt,full of holes in the plot there 's nothing wrong here and a bit to it but
1,the only problem with this film is that it is,the plot concerns the president with an undercover officer
1,to see how he will have to do that because it 's just as good as the one they,to be fair there 's a very young woman who has to be the youngest of her father
1,the plot line is pretty weak and it 's too hard to decide who has made it to do in the real story,the only reason this movie makes sense is because it was in it 's way and was actually very good but it had some
1,but i did n't want to see anything that i like,but what does it mean that 's the reason why
1,whilst i do n't really know why a lot i like watching this movie it 's a very bad movie with some good laughs,whilst this movie is a little bit of fun for some viewers in the mood of the movie it also has a very good cast
1,it 's so sad to see the whole world again and again that there is,it does show a certain level which makes the story more and more compelling
1,this was one of the most awful movies i 've had to endure,this would seem so real and yet in reality it seems like one big
1,all three leads make this a fine movie and the performances by a cast of unknowns that work wonderfully,all three of the characters are likable and it 's refreshing how he always comes across more like a human
1,and this is definitely the worst movie ever,and when they are shooting the scene he looks
1,it 's so funny that the first time we get into it,it was an insult to the intelligence which made it possible
1,i ca n't stress enough how a film made the point that a bunch can do it properly,i think it is very underrated in that sense of time when people have their love interests
1,again it 's a really great movie,again this is a great movie
1,the main characters of the film are either as an afterthought or as a,the movie was n't a great idea but the acting was really good
1,in a way it was a pretty funny movie with an engaging script,in fact the story and story line are very thin very predictable
1,peter o'toole is perfect in the lead role,peter stormare in an early part of the film
1,if you want to see a really good film this was for you,if you want a good movie i would recommend this one but this is
1,now in the meantime he 's trying to get into a taxi and it turns out to be very hard for him to come,now we 're all that i know there can have some good points of the film but i do remember it so much
1,6 if you do believe in yourself this was a,6 the characters are so bad it 's bad
1,in short one of my favorite films in my opinion the movie is an incredible experience,in one scene he is the leader 's wife and the other one is that the wife
1,essentially the characters are so shallow and onedimensional that any good person could be so stupid,essentially that is pretty much all we are supposed to like about how it ends
1,these guys just get a great show to go with you and you ca n't get your hands on this gem,these are some of a bad movies i 've never seen before and i 've seen them and i do n't believe
1,it 's the worst thing in the movie and it is a good movie to watch as,it 's a nice movie that i really enjoy the first two quarters of the trilogy
1,if you are a fan who likes action movies or action movies you should check this out,if your a good fan 's film buff and have seen it before or since you 're missing
1,both are great together in some way,both actors are not only in this one
1,way too many people 's perceptions about not being very,way too predictable to waste the film on that
1,this is a very funny show,this movie is so bad it 's
1,there 's a great deal of action in this movie,there are n't any jokes that i did not think the
1,one thing i'm wondering is this one of the other movies i 've seen i 've seen the trailer on the dvd cover of his dvd jacket on the dvd and the synopsis,one day after the one girl says oh god i guess the best thing is that she has no place that looks as if she had been having a baby on him
1,after seeing this film the movie became a cult following,after the initial shock and then exiting the film with all
1,in all fairness this would be more fun for him than he 'd,in my eyes the film is not so bad it 's good
1,there is a reason why the movie is in the works it 's not,there 's some really cool dialogue to be found but it is not that well
1,a few of us could n't understand the way how it would be in our minds the first ten minutes of,a lot has changed of the movie from the original story to this one but it is n't so bad
1,as soon though i found the ending very satisfying as well as the fact that there were a few good performances in,as to what happens to all of them the whole movie was a joke in my opinion it was not funny
1,when the characters in the film are given more questions than you can imagine in any other form you are left feeling confused,when he tries to get away from a police car and his wife is on the run in a small and dangerous town the
1,wow what more of an american film,wow this is a bad thing
1,every line was as if the writers were trying to make a statement about it and i think it was really good,every episode is filled up like the one with a family of the first season and that is not what we 've been
1,there 's a big possibility in this episode for the first part of the movie,there 's no point in the film at least for those of you who have n't
1,there is a lot to love,there is a plot line which has
1,the acting by all is superb the actors are wonderful as well,the plot is very weak and the story has no depth the acting
1,fortunately i did not see a lot of good,fortunately she 's not afraid of her time
1,without spoiling the plot the movie could have been better,without any of this i found that there is more to
1,you are the only ones in the theatre that they have had,you do know that it 's the right man to try
1,sure this film is n't bad but it has to be,sure this film was not a total disaster for many viewers but
1,i do not understand why the writers of these films have,i would recommend it to anyone from a young age
1,i 've been in my home room so far so since then i was hooked in this movie,i am sure some people will watch the series and will enjoy this show but i would have preferred
1,i 've never seen him act like a man,i have not understood my views of the films as
1,john carpenter is the first of the three stars,john wayne was perfect as the conflicted detective he was
1,obviously that 's how they used to do this film,obviously i did n't know it would be a bad movie
1,does it mention that his brother is a very nice guy and that the boy was a jerk that he really wanted a big part,does this make a whole lot of noise and so what so little to say and i ca n't stand the whole movie is it supposed
1,for the first half of the film the plot is n't as bad or worse than it would 've made for some decent action scenes,for one thing it 's a real shame as we see it 's the type of movie you 've seen on tv in that decade it
1,this is a really bad slasher and is very very boring,this is a great movie to see if only to have an
1,the story is based on the true events and the characters,the movie also features a lot more of the typical characters in
1,had i watched it i might have gone out of your way to see it,had he done a better job in the movie industry than any of these earlier work
1,when his father dies when the family is killed by a giant spider they are hunted by the monster of the monster who is hunting the,when a film is supposed to make one question and a very disturbing movie i just want my to say to myself i did n't
1,this film is very interesting and well worth watching,this is my most favourite movie i 've had that
1,i 've seen thousands and alleviate the plot of an already great movie with the exception being the main characters with the exception of one person who has to deal and adjust with each other so they ca all,i have a soft heart about it for that but this movie is a mess of any substance of the original which was a little too much the plot twist and the overall ending did not save the movie from
1,i do not know if this was supposed to be,i do remember that the acting and the acting
1,i had my moneys and i 've already seen the first movie in this episode,i 've already read somewhere the movie is a comedy but the way it 's handled
1,her character is the one who wants to get married,her father was a bit more convincing about the way than
1,falling asleep on earth and the whole town of hell,falling for the woman in a dress coat and her own
1,but the movie is about the most,but it 's just too good
1,unless you want to see an independent film that could make a good movie,unless there were so much more of the same for the whole production
1,perhaps the movie has a lot more of a plot to it with,perhaps you 'll be too happy if you do n't believe it
1,it 's very hard because of its relentless message and not a great one,it has a good plot good acting great music and a whole lot of good
1,these films are just that bad,these men have never met another one
1,but when it 's said that this film is one big mess and one of its worst points the acting was terrible,but the fact is it is a good example of how an english can be so much fun in such a movie so
1,it seems so that i did n't really get to see any other actor playing a character in this movie,it 's so difficult you try to be hard to get away from the story as you have a good story
1,my favorite scene is a scene where she gets her hands on the head,my favorite part in the film was when i watched the scene of the movie
1,soon the film turns out to be a complete waste as well,soon the film begins but there is no suspense to this film and
1,it 's just like a bad movie in the beginning the only saving graces is a small,it is a shame this movie is a failure because this production has an excellent story
1,i think the movie is a little too much of the same,i do not see the point of view in this film since it
1,lugosi is not only the greatest film of our times but his ability to play,lugosi 's character is supposed so much with a role he actually is n't
1,i could only see the actors of the show and that,i would say this is one of her best performances
1,this is not a great movie,this is n't a good film
1,everybody else is in it or something,everybody else is perfect for it and they
1,i 've read several reviews on this page claiming that some of them are quite,i ca n't understand how anyone would get a movie release in this country
1,as for my daughter as an extra to the end i did n't,as it is he has the opportunity for this kind of thing
1,that does n't mean that the film is n't bad in my view,that part is not even a little scary because you 'll never really see
1,few of the scenes seem interesting in the final cut,few of us have a problem about the film and the
1,still not worth the effort but worth seeing just for his performance,still there may not be enough to make this movie good
1,the only redeeming feature i 've come across to a movie are the songs it 's all very good in this,the movie starts out promising with interesting twists with a bit of suspense but the whole plot just gets annoying
1,while a film like this should be taken to a wider level it does have a very powerful atmosphere to,while the film is not as good i think the actors and actresses in the supporting cast were fine
1,the film takes place in new jersey,the only one i did like was that
1,it 's not a very well made film and there are some very very good scenes the music is also excellent,it has been said that the director and the director had a very important idea of how to write a movie
1,trained to find a cure to her son he is able of the young woman,trained to get a job he does not know how to make the film
1,she looks like she 's been trying to get her in the sack and the girls get her out and she,she is a beautiful woman with a heart of work that will always look like she 's a natural character
1,it 's about an american who gets married to a,it was a waste of my time and money
1,after the first two episodes we have the characters of the first film and their own motivations,after the success of the film the movie begins the story of some of our heroes
1,one of its strongest points has its charms is the final scene which takes the cake and ends,one of my favorites has been to a young audience member on the way of his family
1,this is a very bad show,this is a movie that is n't
1,after being shot in a car accident with an arrow he kills the other man with,after watching this film i was able to relate the story of the two characters
1,it is a bit of a mess but,it could have been a lot better
1,the movie is a little slow but not very convincing,the only thing that keeps me awake for the movie are
1,the music is excellent and the music was beautiful to say it very nice,the only way to make it funny is that there is not a single person
1,this was a very good film and was really,this has to be seen in the movie
1,it is n't that bad and the story just sucks there is n't any action in it,it was not a total mess but it had some potential and some great acting by all who
1,if you are looking at a movie noir on an indie horror film making for good measure,if you want to see how bad this movie looks and how to create a movie for you
1,since that 's a lot for the genre that it 's the last two films i have seen,since then when the film is finally finished there is a plot twist that i was left scratching
1,bea 's father is also about as good as the rest of a family and we are n't shown all these,bea 's parents are also so bad they even have the same kind of girl who was supposed for her
1,it 's not even close up,it is not the worst film of
1,and it is a nice change of fact that i can recall it from the book,and it was like being too late at times but that 's all that i was wrong
1,it 's a pity they did n't get involved,it was made for an r for it was made
1,however the movie ends up with the most tedious conclusion which is a good thing,however when a movie fails i have to say there are times we all had no
1,the only character in the movie that was supposed so funny that,the plot is pretty bad and it does not have enough
1,the story takes over a few years that has,the acting was horrible the directing was awful
1,she just does have a few scenes in it which make you laugh when your sides hurt,she looks in a very different way and it 's all a pity that a film is so
1,stick for a moment in this movie and you 'll not regret,stick with the first one and get a little different more interesting
1,i'm amazed that people have not commented on the acting skills,i'm not saying this is a bad remake i have to go
1,many of the scenes and the dialogues are all very funny and i was so impressed,many have said it but it is so bad it has something to think of and is
1,still there 's some pretty funny jokes but the story is so weak,still this is a film about a very strong individual in london
1,this movie could be seen as just a good comedy about the conflict between the main,this film is a perfect example for the movie 's audience but also very good
1,chances are you 'll be right,chances are that this movie is just
1,as the series continues its a little too esoteric in its portrayal of two children who are married to two men,as the two of them end up with a mysterious killer the only one of the three is actually alive
1,i have to say this movie was very entertaining,i do n't think that anyone will ever know how
1,he seems bored by his own and he has a,he has an excellent performance which i am sure
1,good thing about the movie though there are a bunch which is a bit of a,good luck figuring out who they have to go on to make the last stop
1,i'm sure there is some good stuff in the movie though,i'm a fan but i think that if you like the movie
1,the story of the two partisans is very well done and the performances are well above average by,the only real drawback of this is that at least the filmmakers seem interested in their work
1,you could almost see the film as an inspiration for what it meant,you ca have a good time to get you off and make you laugh
1,the film is one that is n't a perfect example as,the only good parts of the movie are the sets
1,later on that makes it all the better,later on in the film we were supposed a
1,add a new score and a dash of the story of the famous composer,add to that the fact you 'd have had some sort of good taste for
1,unfortunately that part was only made in the,unfortunately it is not a great film
1,however despite the fact that some people have complained about that,however a bit too long to spoil it for me
1,there 's a lot to love about this movie but it is definitely worth seeing,there was not a lot of violence to it that made me think of this
1,the plot is that of an australian girl who is in the woods and has a,the director has a lot less depth and imagination to work than he can handle
1,the whole premise is that a group has been killed by a monster with a secret metal virus,the main character is the son who tries to make a statement about her being a little confused
1,barney has made a good documentary as it 's not the movie 's title which is so,barney is a real boy who just does not look like a man or a villain
1,bette davis is excellent as princess tuck but she is still a bit of a jerk as one of the main actresses and she is a fine actor,bette is a woman who goes to a party where he is being pursued by some of her best friend who is a witch or a father of a
1,for a movie like i was impressed it did not have a lot of redeeming qualities,for a movie it takes the viewer and allows his characters to take the story and the
1,guillermo del toro is the only good thing,guillermo del rio the first of the great classics
1,if you have n't seen this movie then see it for yourself,if the movie had been made at the box office it would be
1,simply put this movie would not be made,simply because it is a real story
1,if you are a diehard hitchcock fan or are looking for an action movie with a message or lack of,if i was a bit harsh with the intention to make an excellent movie i will not be disappointed
1,the acting is not bad at all but there are some good performances,the movie has been a classic in the last 5 years and the acting
1,then the plot begins to go sour so the audience can tell that he has no clue why,then after this movie 's title i realized that i could n't get into the movie theater
1,but i think they were trying to make a good horror movie with the low budgets and the actors that are n't,but the plot in which these people are so good that they do n't seem very believable because the story does not make
1,i do agree but most important that in the end are they so the movie ends with a twist and leaves a little mystery to,i think he does a very good job but he really fails to deliver with the viewer as the plot twists are so contrived
1,film should be banned for the academy awards,film noir is what makes it so enjoyable
1,second in that the two girls try to steal a diamond from,second it 's a movie about how the world was created
1,regardless the movie makes a great story,regardless of this there should have been a
1,goldeneye is the first film of the 2000 series in,goldeneye does n't want us to think too much
1,i could n't have been less wrong,i saw it in the cinema when it
1,it seemed to have been written and directed and written by a guy so the viewer knows why the film does not feature the title or,it seems that he is unable to do anything to save her life and she ca n't even keep up what is happening on her
1,the ending the movie is the most powerful to have in film history is,the film is a little predictable and it 's only half hour long
1,not only to the acting but also because the camera,not that it matters too much in the film
1,this is a real turkey to me,this movie is a perfect movie
1,that is not one for my prudish opinion,that said if that 's the case with the
1,i would n't recommend this movie if you like a good mystery science theatre 3000,i 've seen this many times before but in my view it makes one wonder where
1,when i first heard about it i did like it but in the end it was n't that bad either it was really awful,when it comes time to talk and the dialogue sounds like one you 'll get to see every episode of one or more 's show
1,both of these actors have been cast so badly and are unable,both of those movies are so bad that i have never heard of
1,but the real reason of this is that i have a hard way out of the ordinary story in the story,but i 'll not deny the good points when one considers that this is a really low budget scifi movie
1,ok i have seen it twice and i,ok it 's got a bad start
1,with all the negative comments in a good review the movie has a pretty much bad acting,with his own life there is nothing that makes him more likable or even the character that he
1,lite by a long time after it had been released in prison of the,lite by the fact it 's one of the best of its genre
1,i was not expecting much more than this film,i am an avid supporter of the genre the movie
1,much of the movie takes you back to that time and place which is a lot of the time,much less than the sum itself is the acting and the acting that is not in this movie
1,the music was a lot of fun to listen but it was not too bad it was n't a,the story is that if your going to get married to the woman then you should know better
1,the first movie is an exercise in the story of a bunch of teenage kids who are a teenager and have become romantically successful,the first half of the movie is very dark and the end of the movie is a bit slow but it never gets to a
1,but what i do know is that they are all just normal people who are not the same as,but the real deal is that it 's a real charmer that is just plain stupid to follow
1,so many other people say that it 's a good movie to watch and laugh at,so why do i have to think this movie was n't a musical as it was n't
1,the movie is n't very bad and there should have been little,the ending of the movie is as good as a typical slasher flick
1,unfortunately for the rest of the gang it 's like a home movie,unfortunately there 's no denying that a lot of other people have commented on
1,i ca n't get enough about the characters and the whole,i ca never even get into the characters any one
1,the plot concerns a group of teens who want a baby,the acting was terrible as were the acting of this movie in
1,it just did show some of the worst effects i 've heard,it 's so bad that it 's hard not to laugh
1,the film starts as a documentary on,the first half is quite interesting
1,then there 's the guy and the dog,then he 's trying to get back to his
1,the acting is a joke the direction looks really bad the acting is terrible the music,the film seems to be made up of the usual horror movie of the era
1,the ending and ending of the movie will be quite as bad,the director seems to take the concept too far too seriously
1,but the worst acting i have seen,but as i mentioned above i 'd rather
1,hints about what they were about to come,hints that it did n't even bother to take
1,if your looking for a funny laugh rent it,if you want to see something so funny with a
1,the only thing that can save it from the big trail of a whole,the director and screenwriter have a lot more on them that 's true
1,minus that he makes the most convincing character ever,minus your imagination it 's a pretty good movie
1,the music was very nice and i thought that the film would n't be much more interesting,the plot is simple but the director has an agenda and is also a very nice one at
1,and then you will see a woman strangling someone else in a house when they are on the verge and it 's a very funny scene when a guy gets drunk raped by her boyfriend,and what if the producers of this movie had a good time making the movie so long before they decided that they had a real problem with the first 10 minutes of the movie
1,and then we get a good action film with no real action or character development but a bunch out of the,and he did have a few scenes in the middle one with a woman in the middle of a forest
1,this film is not about the plight it 's just about the us family and their problems that are the,this is not a bad movie but it really is a good movie for anyone who likes romantic comedies
1,in this instance i 'd heard of the director and a few other commentators who said this film,in this particular film it was not as good as a book by any director and director
1,all in all the film is a very long way of showing it and in,all those years ago i watched it again and again when it came out
1,gus has a brief temper of being a young girl in,gus 's evaluation does not go beyond the mundane level
1,four hours into a short story,four out 10 points it is a
1,the script is not too bad,the movie was not funny and the
1,even those who have n't read about the novel will be surprised to find this movie,even the music score was n't that bad in this film that did n't help
1,yeah this has been seen by all my fellow fans but this film did n't,yeah the director is a man that could be so funny to his audience
1,well i did not like them,well maybe the movie is n't good
1,and the ending was absolutely terrible and did not ring,and i have yet another proof this is my favorite movie
1,this movie makes the best movie of,this movie is not a movie
1,eventually the action takes place in a small island,eventually i found myself wondering if the director intended a
1,and this is what happened with this movie,and i can safely say it 's a great
1,i have to say i do n't get it all in a row,i was in a class of this movie and i was n't impressed
1,also this is the most disturbing game i have ever watched and the best one was when the,also if you are a diehard fan of the series i highly recommend you watch the film
1,i had a blast for a movie about 2 times in and i felt i could 've done something more productive,i do think she could just play one role she was the only one that looked at the other side of the
1,by the end i was a little confused at the same time but i guess the,by this time i have seen many of the films in the past 50 years
1,the only difference was to get into any of the episodes which came up,the main character 's daughter and the child is a bit too long
1,taking it 's toll on what is an excellent film it is a movie worth watching especially by the young man and the girl,taking a long island from a small town to see the world trade ii the survivors and the two travelers find their way into an
1,gale morton plays a woman named hester who is the object of life,gale is the first child to take on her family and the way she
1,the characters are shallow and uninteresting the,the film is a good watch
1,just the same type goes for the killer and it 's not like that,just like the other films like das boot the black cat and the devil 2
1,these are not the same people i 've watched this movie with,these days and not in the good way or the other
1,too much of the movie has a lot,too bad it was never released theatrically
1,the only thing good is the soundtrack of the song,the only positive aspect of this movie was the scenery
1,what i liked about this is how it 's done without any explanation of its own,what we were left with for is a scene that is supposed a little too hard
1,lloyd and company do n't seem much of a problem,lloyd 's film is a film to watch if only to
1,all in all a decent horror flick if you can manage to catch it,all the things that made me mad was the fact that the main characters were
1,they should be ashamed that the producers could produce the best of these films but there was a,they were all pretty good for the time they were but they all do a good thing
1,the movie is also the most difficult to see in the movie,the acting was good i would say but i ca n't understand how
1,it is a classic film with a very good plot,it was n't so bad it did have it 's purpose
1,i'm sure that this is n't a good idea to start at it but,i'm not sure what that is all it was supposed to be about
1,the story is about an airplane crash which makes it very easy,the movie just seems to be going to be a lot worse
1,after seeing the first two movies i 'd heard that the director and director of this film,after all these years of watching the tv show i am amazed by the lack name
1,also this is one film worth mentioning,also the ending is pretty good
1,seeing her in the mirror is more of what the characters can be in the audience,seeing the movie was a very interesting change in the art of life to me
1,peck and loy have the chemistry chemistry of the three lovers and the chemistry between the two leads which is both compelling,peck was in this movie and it was an amazing scene that i had seen for a long week and still waiting till
1,although there are two other things i can think of this movie it is very good to see a guy who,although i'm in the mood for a lot the movies i 've had to endure and feel very sad for
1,if you 're not a little depressed it would seem pretty easy you do n't have the permission to,if anything i can overlook that i do n't think it does have a good deal of originality
1,he seems to think of a man who had to be a little less difficult to understand and understand his character and,he had been the most recognizable of all the characters since shakespeare and his two friends are in the same place
1,the music is excellent and the score was a perfect combination to this film and also very reminiscent to the play,the characters are likable and the actors all do a great job but this leads me to believe that this is a
1,the only thing this has to do is that this movie does n't come close,the story is so simple that it 's difficult not to fall into the wrong place
1,in a time he was n't in his forties at one time but,in short it 's an action movie that is not to bad
1,as a result a few scenes have been edited down to this,as the series progressed to show it 's the first season
1,then she gets into trouble and gets out of it so she 'll know it 's,then there are a couple more problems to make this thing more of the first movie in
1,it 's a shame that the makers never saw it in the,it 's a film where the film takes itself too seriously
1,the script is very well done,the film is quite entertaining and the
1,put this into a film that does not deserve it 's own reputation and that,put it this movie is a disgrace for the first time in your life
1,the acting of a woman is very believable as well,the plot is simple the story just goes on for a
1,this movie is the best movie ever made up to date and it 's just about a girl who lives at home,this movie was so terrible i could not even finish the movie properly and i would have loved to know what it was
1,first off this movie is very stupid but i,first of course this is a great movie
1,everything i like about the film it is the same plot,everything he 's been has never been but he still has n't
1,it 's a nice thing to watch with this,it 's a story of an innocent girl who gets
1,and in fact there is no chemistry in any of these,and it 's so funny that it hurts your intelligence
1,batman vs frankenstein the animated series is a lot like a disney animated horror series with no trolls with a,batman vs frankenstein is a great example for the horror subgenre but the film falls flat on its face
1,of course a real problem with the film was the fact it never had,of course i 'd rather not see the same thing as a child
1,it is an absolute must see for those with a sense of heart who is n't a communist or a communist in a country,it is a great family drama about a young man named kale who gets into the trouble of his father a rich father who befriends
1,to be a few other actors did i mention the fact this was,to be fair i'm going on here a lot to this movie
1,the plot was ok for a comedy but the rest of the film is just a,the only thing that keeps the movie from being is the story at the end
1,a few weeks prior to this movie,a good movie if only one character is
1,it 's not a big deal that is so much more exciting,it 's the only reason i can recall the entire film for the
1,less than that is why it is so entertaining and even has the best performance of a,less that would explain the story the story is not quite as bad as the book
1,their work also has a lot of money and money that makes for good,their work is very entertaining but they still fall flat as a whole
1,even if it is the only way that it can be a great movie it is still a great,even a small child and his younger younger sister are just a bit more than they might have
1,but it is a very very enjoyable movie about,but it has to come as much better
1,she 's a little over an inch she is a witch who 's been,she was an extremely bad girl and was quite convincing in the movie
1,so the first three seasons are just awful to watch,so in the middle of a few seconds of the film
1,what i like about the movie is that he 's the kind of guy who just wants to fight against his own prejudices and that he 's in love with someone who is so stupid and so,what i got was a great movie with all the funny jokes that the original did n't expect when in the movie you just get an excellent story lines and a great ending to the story
1,that was my only criticism i did n't expect much of its plot,that scene is in a way the only one which seems like a big
1,but in an effort for getting it on the air it is a good way too long,but in the first part of the movie he has a chance to get rid and lastly his
1,he has a long career on tv 's,he had a bit of money but he did
1,this is the first film in the rated series,this is a story of love and courage
1,that 's not saying anything but a few of the acting talent,that 's a good thing but this movie does not have a particularly
1,though a great director should definitely try to avoid this film for all the wrong reasons,though i did n't care about the characters it was a lot of things you did when
1,there 's a very funny scene in which a man in a bar eats a gun from a bullet and walks a jet talking in front his hand,there 's a few minutes of the film that i did like most of which seemed to go out of its mind to provoke such profound intensity
1,if it was n't for you let me get into that,if i remember my name i could not take more than a
1,at least i saw some of it and i could have done without a complete obligation to watch it to death i was n't even going for some sort i can watch the entire film and watch it,at least one thing to say that they are going to be an amazing film and a very good cast and a very good looking script for a very talented and well crafted movie that is worth checking up
1,almost impossible to swallow but a nice touch that the whole movie seems to be getting in,almost everyone is just there for this movie to go to the bottom of that category
1,a movie is shot in a style of acting,a man who has seen him as a child is
1,it is an interesting movie that you will,it does n't even seem very good
1,and when the first half hour of the movie it 's just a,and when you get the chance you will not find this movie
1,suzanne is the worst of the bunch of men,suzanne was a bit confused to me as was the
1,whilst at least for the director it 's not so bad,whilst i love the character he plays and his older brother is
1,que bodrov jr has some good lines,que sera tam the best film
1,depalma is a genius and this movie is an,depalma 's character is just an average stereotype
1,apart out of the first two of them the second one was n't bad at least not,apart from that there is no excuse to be on the screen to be as bad
1,in my opinion i was n't too much of a problem,in one scene they were trying desperately for a shock
1,either they 're too much of a mess with some,either this was a joke or even remotely good
1,the film has a certain creepiness but it never really goes,the film itself has many elements of horror as well as the
1,it is a complete disgrace to all those who want to watch a movie on that basis alone,it 's a movie with a strong message about sex between men and men who can never really be
1,but this is a great movie,but the film fails to convince that
1,they are both a little bit funny,they have the best scene in this movie
1,the characters are so believable as to be believable,the only redeeming feature of this otherwise forgettable film was
1,while i was n't expecting any of her usual efforts i found her character quite endearing,while this is definitely a movie of all times for the whole family it is worth watching
1,if you like this movie i suggest that you do,if you enjoy the original version you 'll enjoy
1,we know how a character could have been written as a character study a character actor in his films,we 're left to ponder the truth that the filmmakers do not understand the motivations of others but their individual
1,these are the movies that really do n't make me like these,these include a brief and seemingly incomprehensible sequence of events involving one girl
1,i have been searching for a movie since it,i think it is worth buying a ticket
1,but this one is still a very,but the rest is still great
1,he is supposed as he might as well he 's the best man in the movie,he and his wife and wife have become romantically separated and have the courage they have to
1,but for those who have n't yet seen the movie please,but that is why we get to see the characters grow up
1,yet another thing to do is the fact it seems to be a ripoff or a good one because the audience was n't,yet the film is so bad that you can easily see that the makers and director wanted to have a decent story
1,second is the music score that sounds like a mixture of good,second to this day is a series of events where they are all
1,whatever you think it is a bit more than what it seems to be in the first 10 minutes or so,whatever the movie is about it is that the filmmakers and directors were so afraid of being a great director on the
1,what a waste for the talented talented actor,what 's the deal with the guy who 's
1,basically it 's an important piece to play,basically it is a story about two characters who
1,then when they show up the night they,then the movie starts to fall apart
1,if this movie is really an action movie it should be a mystery of sorts to,if you want a good laugh watch something like that if your not an idiot
1,it 's not all bad it is the dumbest,it was the worst movie i 've ever had the
1,this is not the type movie that i do n't,this movie has some similarities to classic hollywood films
1,why does someone call this so bad,why does a good man like hers always
1,i was very angry to watch the trailer which,i love the way that this was made
1,his brother and his father played him,his character in the movie is an idiot
1,i did however see the movie being,i do know about this film
1,another great thing is the way it 's supposed and the ending of the movie,another thing that made this film so special is how that is the same color as
1,good thing about this film is the scene where she tells the young girl about his friend from the beginning,good old fashioned movie that does not go from a long list of films in your life right down to the
1,the only good scenes were the three leads that were obviously in jeopardy and that they could,the first time that he sees the last one of his films is as a classic
1,here and you 've got a recipe,here it is a little too convenient and
1,there 's not a single scene in a movie where nothing is said about the movie being the main character 's character,there is also a scene where the killer is running down and down and eats and then it is shot in the stomach
1,i 've already seen this one and i never heard about it,i was so shocked by these great actors of the time
1,they are the same type of things that you see in movies like the ones where you feel,they are all the same but that does not mean they should at first assume they should
1,they all do n't have the budget or the ability of the audience to make it interesting,they are a bit off the beaten path but they 're still pretty good but they do not
1,this movie is about a young woman who moves into a house to,this time the film is an interesting story and a lot more
1,this movie has a couple parts you ca watch at home and i feel it,this was a horrible film and i would probably recommend watching the mst3k version
1,i had n't even been able to locate her and the fact that when,i do think that this has a very similar message on this topic
1,i am going to comment on the saying that i was n't a fan of this type of film,i was so excited that i had n't heard about this film after seeing it as a teenager in my
1,people say they say that you are making them,people are dying and i will admit that i have
1,with the exception in the cast the cinematography was fantastic,with my father 's the best friend to be a musician
1,ok now that 's the only way i can remember it as i 've seen it but i do n't know who did it,ok i know that 's a lot of things that happened during this film the first few scenes in which the main characters and they
1,you 'll notice that the film has been shot by a studio in london and is very hard on your eye,you can get away from this film and if you are a true fan of that genre you 'll want you do
1,for a good reason though i did n't think the movie was anything but i guess this was an ok movie but was a complete waste of my,for example they 're supposed to be an american ninja and the guy is just plain stupid in a movie that you would n't see coming in
1,the script was good even if the dialogue was not great,the acting was so bad that i had no idea of who
1,this is the sort that was a good idea for me,this is one of those films where it 's trying to show
1,of all the stars in the film the only reason i give a star star is because i had never seen the,of the fact that he is an actor he does n't seem very good and does n't really have much talent
1,the script in this film has some,the film is one big tease
1,but if you 're looking for a bad bad movie to get,but as an aside it 's still good for a laugh
1,this is a very simple film in an,this is a very very sad story
1,this is probably why they were n't in the film for an award to their work,this is the only movie i 've seen with my wife who can identify in anything
1,along with the movie 's great cast and production design it 's a nice,along with the director 's film the film has several other memorable moments
1,i 've got the feeling to my point of,i was n't a fan of a movie
1,in this film a man is a young man from the hospital kpax,in this episode they are also not even funny like it is
1,the only way for them are in the film,the only thing that really annoyed this movie was that
1,i thought this movie was good,i had never heard a word of
1,this is a film about the power of mankind and what is being said to a man,this is by no means a great comedy but it is a bit of a mess
1,sarah and the stranger are the characters that are n't as well in the book as,sarah 's character development is more interesting but it 's a little jarring for me
1,he 's an expert with the help,he is n't an easy target
1,kevin conroy is n't too bad as the title role but he is a,kevin spacey has a small role in this movie and he gets it
1,then i thought of a film by the name john w,then the scene where a girl is trying to eat the guy
1,this movie is really about a group that is not a member to the end of,this movie does not need to have a much maligned script or is it possible
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie its not even,there are several things in the whole movie you can enjoy
1,tanks are the same with the rest of the cast,tanks fly in the basement and the ship explodes and it
1,the characters are interesting though a couple are so incredibly annoying they ca n't be explained,the first thing we see on the show is that it is n't the only movie that
1,it was an awesome movie and i do not believe it,it 's hard for us to believe that the film is an
1,the actors are very believable especially robert stack,the only way i could get my teeth from
1,please tell me that it 's probably my all too long movie,please do n't even think of renting it and have a good scare
1,later on the movie switches to a good story,later the movie is shot by the director
1,i do think she was a very talented actress i was n't really moved by watching the movie,i really think that this movie is very funny in an mst3k sort and it makes you laugh
1,how could the director and director allow us not to like him,how many times have you been so disgusted and confused that the film
1,he is an excellent actor whose acting is also good but it is hard not for those who are n't,he had the potential for being the best one and it had to take a very very funny movie
1,now if you do not have to worry about the movie you should probably skip it,now it 's a film about some young people and one who can get married and a
1,mina is a wonderful actress and she plays,mina chopra is n't a bad actress
1,to begin this one will probably get a,to be honest the movie makes sense
1,sorrows of the day it 's a matter for a guy who can control a lot more than he does,sorrows were all over the place and this made no attempt at making a movie in the world of the dead
1,would be the best one i have ever heard,would you have been there in the middle of nowhere
1,the ending is very anticlimatic as to the identity itself,the acting was great as i expected this movie was very
1,judge reinhold and her brother are the two leads,judge reinhold is a delight in this film
1,one scene where the one guy is holding the gun on his head and then gets shot in,one thing that really impressed me is that the ending is a little too abrupt for me
1,and this is what is good about the film but it is an emotional pleasure,and if i were on this movie 's character i would have been a little ashamed
1,the director should have known he wrote some,the story is n't really as simple
1,i was n't able into the world of this film in the same way with the first one,i was really surprised at the end of the movie when i saw it was a bit of a
1,vacuous and annoying it is all over the world,vacuous script of a bunch in the form but a
1,the plot of this movie is n't bad but its not a good thing,the story is very interesting and interesting at times so if you can catch it
1,just when you think the movie is trying to get some serious meaning it takes a,just like you know i know that i 'll give my advice in the end
1,i thought that it was a pretty enjoyable movie to see,i think that the only way i can explain is the fact
1,duvall 's character was a real hero but was not convincing,duvall plays a man who is diagnosed to be seen in the
1,and this is where it is presented,and it 's a very well made and
1,kal penn is a fine director but he is,kal penn as the cop is also fine
1,however as soon as the film starts it 's,however for me it was not that much
1,i'm not a big fan of the original,i'm surprised that he was in this
1,then i read the book the pages,then a man who is supposed to be
1,having said that the only way i found this film is the performance was a great deal of dialogue and character,having said all i can say that i would like a film where this was the first movie to use
1,is it the same place or not i do think i missed,is it any wonder that the original has the same title
1,inter as she tells us that he is being a killer,inter in the end it seems to be another film
1,one day he gets a job in his wife who is in the same building as the man and his sister,one of my favorites is the very last scene where the father of the young boy takes the same kid to the
1,there 's so much going on in this movie it 's easy to believe that the audience is supposed as an observer,there was also a very brief scene where the mother of her family has taken a few years ago to get into the
1,midnight cowboy is one bad film that is only for those who want to know,midnight vacation 2 was a waste for the time and money spent on the making of
1,there is no real reason of this,there are a number that has slipped into
1,they make a mistake for the story the best i 've heard about it is to show off and you 'll know what you 're in,they are not the brightest ones i 've ever read on my list of all time greats because their character is played by james bond
1,sure it is a good family movie but not all movies are bad,sure there 's a lot of gratuitous nudity but this is where the movie
1,likewise it 's a good family movie to watch as they get the chance,likewise they do n't have to be the real murderer in the book
1,not that she did any better work but not in an action movie,not only is the acting good but the plot does it work
1,it does n't have any meaning,it 's also a wonderful film if
1,after watching it on a rainy saturday night i decided to watch it on tv,after watching this film i am a bit prejudiced but i do n't really know why
1,i do n't understand that this was supposed for the money the,i am glad i never got to see this movie again
1,alright so i think if it was n't,alright i have to ask you why
1,this is a very simple film,this was a very bad movie i
1,there was one thing i noticed in the movie i loved this movie,there are two things going on in my mind this is one film that
1,do we do this movie for a real,do n't let the movie fool this
1,you will see the same as i did in the first,you will not be disappointed unless someone is a fan of the
1,if you like horror you 're dead from the beginning,if anything the movie has the same exact plot
1,more like the film i thought,more to the extent the viewer is
1,unlike the other two the characters the story the acting the animation,unlike a lot of the movie this has some interesting moments
1,i do agree with the other imdb reviewers i do n't see any of the actors who really did n't know,i have not seen this film in a couple years and it is certainly just as good as the first
1,randy douglas is one to look for in movies,randy quaid is the only redeeming factor in it and
1,and there is that one of the many things i,and the acting was good but not the bad
1,the movie follows an important story that develops between the protagonists and the hardships that are present in which the family 's friends are portrayed,the plot is interesting too but there 's still a very interesting and original plot and good acting and the story is so predictable that i
1,sooraj ichikawa 's the film adaptation of 'the haunting the story a haunting film that the,sooraj jodorowsky 's character was a genius and was not able to be a hero
1,first of all i was a little confused about the movie as a whole,first of all this is a good little movie that you do n't get 110
1,whatever it was meant to make a point to the audience that it,whatever the case was a little too much for its own good
1,some things that are really bad are the bad parts and the bad dubbing is very bad and the music is bad but not a bad one,some scenes seem to have been edited at a certain pace or a few points from the original but it 's not nearly as compelling as its predecessor
1,another reason why this movie was so much was the story for a young girl,another scene is the scene where jack and jody get together with an rv
1,this episode is a good one,this was the type of movie that
1,the main plot involves a small number,the story is really really bad
1,the whole thing is about a young woman from an age who had been sent to,the first half is a spoof of a film of its ilk in this case
1,sorry to think he might find this,sorry it is n't worth seeing
1,few times during this movie the actors are given a lot of screen time,few will notice that the movie is based on a real life play of the
1,i'm glad i did n't like it,i'm pretty impressed by this show
1,why does n't anybody say that the story is set in south africa and is actually the same as you can,why did n't it end with a little boy running around with a dog who 's been on the run
1,why would he have to kill her in one room after he died with some mates,why would the makers have chosen to make it into a film and instead it had the
1,paul lukas is brilliant in this movie as he is the one he played and he,paul sorvino was so wooden and unfunny that it was n't hard to take out
1,the only thing that made it worse was how people were killed,the acting directing editing etc it 's all a bit below par for
1,of all the remakes i saw this in my estimation i thought it would be,of all the other movies i 've ever seen this one i really enjoyed
1,it 's really a shame that this movie is not available on dvd,it was a waste of time i had to watch it for the first
1,all the kids are a hoot,all we have is some kind of
1,in this scene we see an elderly soldier,in other words it is like this
1,it 's a pity as to why they could,it was not a movie of this caliber
1,add to that the fact the filmmakers think a bunch of morons are doing something different and a bit different from the others that made the,add in to another one of those movies that does not have much more substance than this film and should 've been a great movie
1,drake has a son and has a son who is being bullied by a serial,drake 's brother a lawyer who 's got up with his son 's friends who have
1,i'm sorry but i 'll tell you this movie is horrible bad bad,i'm not saying that but that 's all there is to do
1,truth be told i am a true horror fan,truth is that this is a very different kind than
1,this is a film that i 'd strongly suggest it does n't deserve as much to do,this film 's story has no point at that it 's so implausible and the fact that it
1,then the plot goes to show how to do,then it is a pretty lame horror movie
1,martin landau was an outstanding choice for playing the title role,martin is a nice guy who 's always trying to get up
1,the acting was atrocious but the story was decent,the film is a true classic to watch
1,this movie was just plain awful,this movie has everything the first movie
1,definitely a movie like the one in the old sector,definitely worth seeing but this was not a movie for everyone
1,do yourself a look for this one,do n't worry about this movie
1,the story was pretty straightforward the acting is superb and there is absolutely a strong performance from him,the film is a total mess for me it 's just a mess but that 's ok
1,if you like this movie i strongly recommend that you check out this,if the director and cast crew had been shot dead by the director they
1,as far as i am not concerned that a movie has a good,as for the plot it 's not even close to the slightest
1,and the ending does n't really work out,and the acting from the rest was n't bad
1,1942 's original version of the book of the century a very interesting and touching,1942 is a great movie in the first two weeks i loved the book
1,unfortunately i would be a big let down,unfortunately she has a chance to turn him into
1,suddenly the girl is a young man who just has to deal,suddenly the main character is killed by the devil and the boy is
1,tony hawk and ted jones have proved that they are really good people,tony leung 's direction was excellent especially the casting of the lead man who
1,the film is an example and an extremely rewarding one,the acting of a great character is very good
1,if you 're looking for the worst kind of movie i highly suggest that you do n't have a lot of fun to be bored,if i 'd seen this film with a similar sense of reality it might have helped a lot more on the story as well as the
1,sublime film from the same director and directed over the years,sublime acting in this movie that is not helped by anyone concerned
1,for a change or a few films i was n't looking forward to that one of them as i,for example the main characters who appear as a giant in the original 's were in the woods
1,i think the whole idea of having,i was very excited about this
1,the movie has a bit of a mystery,the music and the acting is superb
1,on a scale of 110 to 10 i 've seen the first 10 minutes where everything else is so terrible it 's bad,on this particular occasion is the fact that we do know the story of the young woman from the future who is not as
1,us brits were the ones who had only heard of this movie because it starred james stewart,us is that it was not about the people from america or how it got to the point
1,i was surprised that the film is about an actor called ator,i saw the movie when i was about 8 years and i did
1,most of us are aware of the power that is lost of the world that is being held on and it is not a big deal,most movies have a similar approach about the nature of the film which is so good so that the movie is n't worth watching on the screen
1,unfortunately this film fails to deliver anything new and not very scary it 's,unfortunately the film is a mess in the context of the first film
1,my wife is a girl on the heels of the,my friend 's been one and the same movie
1,the whole movie is about a man who lives in a small,the story is pretty good and the actors are quite good
1,last is the one i saw the second time and i was just stunned at it,last of course the two guys are the only people whose parents are n't as interesting as
1,one thing for sure this was the worst movie ever,one could think that this might be some great film but
1,if you are a big fan you 'll love this movie as it takes it back to it 's roots,if you can handle the plot with the plot and characters you must be bored in what to get and you
1,strange as a comedy about an aging person who lives,strange people have n't even heard the term name
1,the first 15 minutes or the third episode shows up a few seconds but it was all downhill for a long time,the film is a bit slow paced at best but the rest of the characters are good and the story line was so
1,i had to give up on this movie after,i am not one to judge this movie
1,when she meets his friend in which she tells them to spend the night in,when they are being forced into their lives and are left with their parents
1,audio style in the scene in which a bunch has the look like it was shot in,audio was a major plus i just had to comment on the director and his crew
1,he 's not even mentioned in the movie that the story is good enough so you,he is an american man in prison and his life with them are all fine
1,this is one of the most original movies that i have ever watched,this movie is not even good it 's not even a movie and is
1,otherwise this is a real good movie that shows all the things that make it such great acting good characters and excellent,otherwise this is a fun film if you like the kind of movie i do n't think then watch this film
1,later a young man is a woman who can take her in her place in a convent,later we go from one place through another to the other without any remorse at all
1,fortunately in the end that 's not what it appears to feel,fortunately we 're not supposed or pray that he 's just a jerk
1,because the movie takes place in a world that will be used as,because you could n't get past my personal problems with the movie
1,pains that they did n't make it to their prime time slot in the states,pains me and my comment it has all the good qualities of a good movie in
1,i do n't know what to say,i had read that they 're trying to
1,i'm sure the filmmakers did n't have the decency of being the same author at,i'm just a teenager for the age of 17 i do like this movie
1,if you love bad acting bad acting bad plot bad dialog bad,if you liked the movie you really do n't want it
1,she is a young lady that has n't been married for her own lives,she has a great ability towards her acting abilities that are quite believable but the
1,even if it could be the film the story of a girl that was a little too chummy with the truth would be interesting or not for the,even when the movie 's first release on the other film i was disappointed to see the movie i had to see it because of the director
1,it 's a shame that so many movies did not make this a little bit of a mess of the original,it 's not just a movie for the fans the only person who knows is that the movie has been made
1,at the end of this movie we see a lot,at least he had a chance in life and the world
1,well maybe the movie 's story line,well it 's got that right
1,before the film 's audience i was really impressed with what the movie is about,before sunrise is the first movie with the same effect as the first movie
1,the characters are also the same,the movie is pretty much a mess
1,sure it 's a great comedy,sure there are n't many good movies
1,standard horror film which is a real disappointment to me,standard of all of the above mentioned the series has been
1,i have to admit i found it quite funny for my taste,i would like it if my sister had to give the two lead
1,he 's not going to be the same person that he can,he is also so good he has some great scenes in his eyes
1,alex also has a soft spot on himself as a young girl,alex does n't have to go to the bathroom as a means to
1,the ending of the film was very well planned as the characters were n't in the book but it just had to be,the acting was awful the dialogue was lame the acting was n't even worth the grade i paid to watch it again
1,the acting is so bad that you really have n't seen it before in any other movie i 've ever heard,the plot is not bad at allit although it gets to the climax that the first half hour or two is n't
1,that is why i love this movie so much i was not so bored and i,that would be a shame if we had a chance to watch such a movie
1,the plot is a little bit contrived and the story is weak,the characters who are n't all likable are just the ones you see
1,you do know what is supposed for you to do it,you can imagine the director 's intention being this one
1,have they ever met a child,have the makers of this movie think
1,i was looking forward at imdb in the movie and i think it is an important film that,i have to admit to this review this was n't even the worst movie of the week
1,along with the cast the cast list is excellent,along the way the characters get in the audience with
1,it 's just too bad the actors did a good thing,it 's very easy to understand why some are the same old
1,well this is a terrible sequel to this and i would say,well i am sorry i was n't in love with the first two
1,while the story is not the original the acting was very good,while i had a bit of a problem about this movie i still
1,this movie had so much promise so that,this was a bad movie for sure
1,let me start with this scene,let 's see the rest is what
1,all the women in this movie do a nice job in their roles,all we need to know is that we know that the story is actually
1,now i'm a fan and i 've seen many other films but this one takes me to the worst movie ever made in,now i know what it has all gears with such a great cast as a tv movie that is a real shame
1,the movie follows a group in the west where two prisoners are stranded in a small village,the only good points in the entire series are the three main supporting characters a very funny and
1,surely a lot of things were going downhill,surely it 's just one day before the last
1,realizing how the film does n't make sense the viewer is left confused and confused,realizing the story of young men who love being sexually challenged and having sex in her
1,much of the movie is spent listening and takes to a different topic where the characters do their work,much is also made and ignored to a degree that the movie just looks like someone 's basement is going
1,i 've seen this one twice,i have never seen such films as
1,with a lot of people running there with no apparent story arc it still seems that the director,with the exception of the main actor this is not really worth the effort for the movie
1,at first i thought she looked like a girl but she was supposed to be a good one and she could n't even get herself to,at last you will see the similarities to the two main characters who are more in danger than their normal counterparts with his wife being
1,i am glad i'm in this world for the next hour of the movie,i do agree with the director and i 've seen many movies with bad taste
1,holly 's mother is the only one who does n't recognize her father and she is attracted to his family who,holly hunter 's character is a caricature of the book of the novel and the acting in the first film
1,avoid at all cost avoid this movie at the end of the eighties,avoid this one as it is a waste of time and money on this
1,the script is great the characters are real and there are some nice twists and twists,the acting is terrible and it is painfully obvious that it just is a cheap tv production
1,it is a good movie that does n't have a story or plot,it is very hard not to see such things but they are not
1,this is the type that i would consider to,this film is one of my alltime favorites
1,technically the acting and editing were superb,technically speaking of the film it does contain
1,they both are just in love with the same women,they were all very interesting and funny in a way that
1,the only problem with the story is the fact that you do n't actually understand the character because,the main problem is that it does n't have any real laughs at all to be found
1,the plot is about a serial killer who,the acting ranges from bad to awful
1,that being said the best part of the,that 's the point of it all
1,a few minutes to save the movie the music is just fantastic,a few years later i have seen that movie on my laptop
1,but the plot is so stupid that it seems like they were just trying to do something different in their life together,but it 's still fun and a fun way of delivering a funny movie that does what i can for a movie like
1,are some of you that have ever seen movies that,are the cops not dead and not that well
1,women would like the old woman who she used the name of the film is a very funny and funny scene where she tells her boyfriend that she should go to school,women should be ashamed of themselves for having spent their time in the world with each other and the fact that they never have to deal with a woman as being the greatest
1,in conclusion that is pretty much a compliment to it,in the final analysis the first of the first two seasons
1,is a film that should have been made,is that a good sign to say
1,his only real acting skills is a man with a,his father is a very good and funny movie
1,i would say that the characters were all,i love the original version as well
1,on the other a young man is a woman who wants revenge and the woman of her career to do a,on a scale note i'm a sucker of independent film makers and i love to watch movies such a treat
1,career is a great movie in every sense,career to make movies like citizen x
1,great job for any person who has ever,great acting and well deserved a nomination
1,girlfight has been a big fan of the,girlfight 's plot was a little weak
1,the first film was a success,the movie is n't very scary but
1,i saw the whole thing on hbo as i have said this one was the most expensive and boring piece on dvd,i was able for an oscar winner for her role in this film and was the highlight of the flick 's credit in
1,the characters are likable and they are believable characters,the script itself is so terrible that it ca all
1,to me this is one of the most overrated horror films of recent year,to sum her up as a woman and the men who would have been a
1,javier bardem is great here he 's the ultimate star of the,javier bardem is wonderful and makes a great team of friends
1,aside in that respect is one of those films like that that i do have seen on my toes and i have to say i loved the movie,aside from that it has nothing to do with anything but one big problem that is so predictable that you 're forced into thinking of it for the sake
1,full of suspense and humor and suspense that i enjoyed as an homage to other films like this and,full marks to his director the great director and the cast for bringing a lot to the movie
1,a group of friends and their son are attacked and tortured,a few more times the movie slows to the ground
1,about the most important thing about this movie is how much i hate it,about ten minutes later he becomes a victim of the world and is a little
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's the kind you have to pay for,it is a story where we 're treated with our imagination but the story is really interesting
1,i ca only think one thing in the movie that i do not like but that,i had heard the movie but it would be interesting or at any given time
1,i saw this film as a teenager in the netherlands,i would not be scared out to see this movie if
1,thanks the fact this series is a classic as well,thanks the film was a bit of a disappointment
1,ok now they do n't have to go out and,ok i was very excited to see this sequel
1,at first i thought i 'd throw up the screen to make it look,at least the filmmakers did n't know that when i saw the trailer
1,as a film maker it seems that this is not an important issue to a,as a result i do n't think anyone is safe to make this movie
1,you 'll be so disappointed that the film is set in the first,you know the kind of person that 's gonna have a movie
1,for me however i do n't want anyone here for a comedy film but this one falls flat in it 's face and it does the very thing,for instance when in the world that 's a bad thing the movie is about how the two men survive from the woods to the last scene that makes
1,it 's not even the great performance of michael keaton who is the best character ever,it is a shame that they could afford this sequel as a sequel to the series and
1,bijou 's character is not a very complex character,bijou phillips is a good actress who has a great
1,i do n't think you have to watch this movie to see what it has to do,i had the pleasure of seeing this as an american film on the scifi film channel
1,although it 's not really the best movie i 've watched but it is,although not a good movie this one is not worth renting for any
1,restored a series that had been made to,restored and i had a good memory
1,along with the other comments i liked the film and the story i was surprised by the end,along with this film 's success the director manages to make the film and the atmosphere of a great
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt and i was,and the film makes a point to a plot
1,people who hate this movie should be ashamed about how it is going for it,people that i saw the first 30 minutes just got annoyed and wanted to get out
1,and the whole thing was a joke to begin,and the movie has a lot of good things going
1,but the best thing about me is that it has a,but you get to see the ending of the movie
1,death valley is an excellent piece of cinema,death is n't about the fact that the film
1,although the first two are the same as the first movie this was not the case but it 's still a very,although the movie is quite well done it 's not a film and the director relies on to create suspense tension
1,how come she never came out of a theater of the time,how can someone put a movie on the line of such a low
1,but this really does not seem like a good idea,but i can only assume i was a bit harsh for
1,this is a movie from the first movie that was the first time you had seen the two and it had the same exact effect,this movie has to be the first film which could have been made with no imagination it might be a cult classic but it is so
1,to make an appearance from a director of such films as this and so on,to be a lot of people in high schools i did see the trailer
1,but it should be noted by the fact of being a child,but then the first one is just the kind of action to follow
1,not even a very good movie or a bad movie it just was n't that bad,not because of the fact the film is a work or a film but rather a comedy
1,the story is simple and the characters all,the script is n't really as bad
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie is one hell out of
1,some parts are just too long done to,some people are wrong for the same
1,why the heck are the main characters in the movie and who is supposed to do,why i do so much is the story of a family that was born to be married
1,the film is a visual masterpiece about a man who works in,the acting sucks at best and the actors all fail miserably
1,much better than this film which was very disappointing to me,much much better then it is the acting is poor
1,i'm not surprised to have a movie this is good,i'm a sucker but i was n't disappointed with the movie
1,giving the movie all the publicity possible and i could go by with my friend as,giving this show a chance it is more interesting than a disney channel movie about
1,its an odd but good movie for kids,its a shame that the dvd cover makes it
1,would it be any worse i could go on and give it a try but there really was n't,would n't she be able in the ways of being the one to become pregnant with the rest
1,this movie really is a good one it is a bit like a bad attempt on a horror film,this is just a bad thing for all ages and this time the writer and director have the same
1,the first of which is a pretty cool concept and some decent acting,the only real drawback to this film is the fact that it 's a
1,this is a movie that should have,this is a very good movie
1,committed by a man with no experience and even more money and money,committed by two of my local children in school i found it difficult to
1,as an adult i would like to be able of the characters in every scene and how they are,as for the story it 's pretty much a movie about a girl getting to the bottom line
1,i think a lot of people have said that it 's bad,i could easily see his wife who would be a bit of a
1,some of his scenes include the best scene between tom 's mom and the girl,some scenes are so boring you can barely make a better choice out it
1,though there is only a few funny lines the movie is really lame,though the main characters are n't all that attractive the movie is still good
1,this film is n't about the evils that you might find in an early film,this is a movie that is not just the kind to be a comedy
1,anyone who has watched the show know that this show is a waste,anyone could have said that the acting was a bit stiff by today 's
1,but that 's really all this movie is,but if you enjoy films that are funny you
1,a movie about a bunch with an old man 's girlfriend,a young lady is kidnapped and raped a young man from his
1,combine a great story about the life of war on the one of,combine a few of these genres together in the most ridiculous sense
1,am that supposed too much to be too harsh,am i saying that this movie is not as much
1,perhaps the producers will do anything to dispel his future vision,perhaps it was because the acting was just as bad
1,richard 's life seems to end the way,richard grieco 's character is just annoying
1,without the action sequences we see an old man dressed on a,without the other cast in the world it makes no sense
1,the first half hour of the show are like a series where they just,the film is a bit of a mishmash but it certainly is n't
1,as much as the characters themselves are good i really liked the ending,as you probably know the story has some very funny moments but it 's
1,add the fact that you have to be a kid if that 's true,add nothing to the whole thing and the whole film looks like it was shot
1,there is no way that i can find a new movie,there 's a few scenes where the main character 's head falls
1,as a matter of pace it was a bit overdone,as for this film i will always be a fan
1,i do n't care how this film got so much publicity as a dvd release,i had seen this movie many times before and could only dream of jeannie smith or
1,the acting is awful with no apparent explanation given to the camera,the only redeeming feature about one of izo 's other work
1,also when she realizes that the girl,also the characters are very good
1,actually it did work in the theaters,actually this was supposed a drama of sorts
1,this is not a movie that will appeal to all,this film is not the greatest of all time
1,by the time i saw the film in the theater theater a couple months ago it became clear that the movie is not very much on the level of the,by the end it becomes clear that there is nothing worth remembering in the movie that does n't make it any easier to watch because they 're not funny
1,even though the plot seems rather contrived and the characters are onedimensional they are just plain funny,even if this was one of his first movies and the second time they went the movie they
1,the first of the two tales was a bit of fun as well as the,the plot and the characters just do not fit the story is all in
1,and i do n't have any idea of why it is such a great movie,and the last scene where he was supposed to be one that really happened in a
1,just like watching a tv series of events i,just do some of the best movies ever
1,but the plot and plot are so good that you ca n't help with,but the fact is it 's a fun way to start a sequel
1,its really nice and not even worth seeing just for,its a great film that everyone should have told
1,it seems that the writers did not like a lot about this,it was the most disturbing movie that is ever put on film and
1,let the rest of it take place,let me just say it was not the
1,as it is the film 's greatest strength would be,as a result the movie is a complete mess
1,when we finally see an old boy 's face on the floor with his hand on a bridge it is just painful to watch,when they get a chance to escape the city and his family and his parents are left to fend for themselves from their jobs
1,an interesting cast include richard widmark alan hale william bendix william kennedy,an attempt to capitalize more at his own character is not a good
1,husbands and dolls were the nicest thing to follow on a saturday,husbands do n't see their children at home with the kids
1,so we get it out of the way the first,so you can get your hands off your ears
1,barbara bouchet 's character is so annoying and,barbara stanwyck 's character is as interesting
1,raj is a beautiful and charming woman that she,raj was the worst actor in the business
1,for those who have a soft heart with the characters it 'll make you laugh,for anyone interested in the genre please check for the fact the film 's producer had
1,i really did enjoy the movie,i thought there was a plot and
1,the only good part is the fact it was just too much,the first part of a story with great character development and some good
1,for some reason that 's the only reason that i give it a 2 out 10 because i think the acting is bad as well and not the script but the acting,for the first 45 minutes i was wondering what was the scene in the film that was the main reason why this film is being a favorite of the genre genre
1,although the acting was n't very good for the most part it is n't a great movie,although it was supposed the theme of the movie and a few things that really made this film
1,spoiler ahead there is a scene in,spoiler ahead the story was simple
1,the movie was a great movie,the movie is filled up with very
1,so he decides he would have a chance,so i have seen more of it
1,what do you see in movies like the ones in which the girls have,what happened during these four hours was a real pleasure to behold the most part
1,after i saw this on tv i could have done a lot better,after a brief meeting with an elderly woman he realizes a little more
1,the acting the script was terrible the story had a good story it was so ridiculous i was waiting for the movie to be a little predictable in parts the acting by both the guy who plays his mom,the film takes the form of being an old fashioned movie to show the story of a young boy who has a son a mother and daughter who is cheating on the young life of a rich woman
1,kurt cobain does n't have the same charisma as it did in those films,kurt russell is good in what is now a role which he 's playing a
1,and the rest of this movie is the best,and then the film switches into a very funny sequence
1,logic aside from some very very very bad acting and good acting,logic of the day was the way it came out of the water
1,this is not the most memorable film i 've watched,this was definitely one film i would love for anyone who
1,in this case the hero takes his wife 's advice and says the f word,in this film there is a big difference between a good and bad movie
1,the story and acting are excellent,the only thing that i liked about
1,i 've never seen anything so bad,i was impressed with this show
1,this is my opinion and this is the best i do see the movie,this is by no surprise the greatest movie i 've saw in my life
1,this is a movie where the film 's premise goes straight to the forefront,this is a real shame that this film has not got a cult status but
1,on some level i was able through my life and,on the plus side the actors are quite interesting
1,the plot is interesting the acting is above par for the most of all and the script by michael winner is the best,the only real surprise at all was the ending when she finally killed her father and then her son is dead and the daughter
1,there are a lot to tell which makes this show worth watching in the context of the,there is the scene where the two main leads of the film are a little awkward
1,but i can only imagine how they could do something about them and to make them better,but what is it about that who knows a lot about them is n't a film
1,beatty has a knack to play and he does n't want to make his own movies like this,beatty as the head of the gang of men who get a hold down for the last time
1,within a movie you 've seen that all a movie,within one moment they try to rescue the president
1,it' was one of my alltime favorites on the card,it' is one reason to think of one good reason to
1,has it ever been made in its time,has a thing of this sort that makes a
1,if you want a movie that was supposed to make you laugh or laugh and then try to,if it is all the film it 's a film that 's meant for everyone to see
1,maybe he should have stayed alive for the entire movie,maybe it was that the filmmakers were too busy filming a
1,mitch and arthur do not need to be together,mitch is the daughter who 's not a real person
1,i just saw the dvd cover and was very impressed,i do remember that there was much to like with this
1,although there were several moments that had to be seen to make the movie more powerful there are some very good scenes,although the director was obviously attempting to shock some kind of people at the end they could n't help but love
1,this movie has been written to be a classic,this is n't the best show i 've seen since
1,i ca n't remember anyone that 's a big fan of any movie or any,i had no idea that this was made on video at a high school
1,from the opening sequence to the end,from the opening to this last minute to
1,what i liked about the film was that the film was shot in canada,what 's so stupid is that it is so obvious that the director was trying
1,here we are supposed to feel like a character in the beginning of a,here 's a list of the most important parts from the entire series
1,please save your own life and do n't,please do yourself an audience and a few good
1,enter the house on a bicycle station,enter the world with no one or no
1,the director should have had the director removed it for his work by using the camera to show us some emotion and how a director felt a movie and got what he deserved but that does n't necessarily help,the plot of the film is so full it has a lot of problems i have n't read a story or book before i watched this movie but in the original story the acting was so poor it was like
1,the movie is just about a family member that the dad says in his family that he 's got to,the characters are so shallow they all seem to be in fact the most unrealistic character in this movie
1,near its climax in the movie the plot of death on haunted planet is the most interesting thing about it and i was n't sure what it 's about,near the end of the movie he is a young woman who is in love with her and the two of their students do not really come to see
1,salacious acting and directing this is not what happens here,salacious and disgusting is the kind and a lot to like
1,lydon 's performance as the mother of a child is very believable,lydon and dunne are both excellent as the leads themselves which is not
1,many of us do n't even understand that there was n't a single character that could be,many movies have been shot in this world but this one is not really for people
1,the movie is n't bad but it was n't even the best,the whole thing looks more interesting than the typical bollywood film
1,although i think a lot of them did n't,although it is not that good to watch
1,i saw the dvd and the dvd that this movie was,i ca all about this movie from beginning to end
1,as the credits roll this is a very moving picture,as a movie it really is n't that bad
1,i do remember seeing his wife having an affair with a child and she was still trying to get her to come out,i love you i 've seen many other movies and i have to say that this one is one of the best
1,this is one movie you can take you to see,this was one of my first movie movies to be so
1,it 's an excellent family film that,it 's all a bit tiresome
1,the only drawback for me was the ending,the ending is quite abrupt and the story is
1,like the old man who has the habit on the subject and the film 's climax the director wisely builds his own personal perspective with the,like a man who wants us to look like you 've lived all these movies that have been told to have been over the top
1,if you do not know this is a good movie it may be you to rent it if your out of the ordinary,if you 're looking at a movie that is n't a movie about a bunch of people you 'd have the chance of seeing
1,the actors were excellent the characters were wellwritten,the movie is a lot better though the movie
1,she 's a good man but not a woman who 's in her forties and she,she is the best she could come up with if she was n't that bad
1,i'm surprised that the director got a chance after a series,i'm sure he must have done more of this movie than that
1,a very entertaining scene in which the characters take a bath,a great movie worth seeking and it does n't disappoint
1,it 's the same old time,it 's just that the story gets
1,jacobi is excellent as the lead and gives it some very strong performances as the mother,jacobi and the rest are quite good and they come close to portraying that kind
1,there 's the usual evil dead body that 's all a little overdone,there is a lot to be taken into consideration that this could be one
1,the movie is n't bad at all,the first film was a bit much in
1,after all the story the characters and the director and the cast all involved in the production,after the death of his father who is left alone in the woods he 's a victim from
1,you see the actors deliver their lines and then all the characters and situations that are present throughout the film are just too,you 're in the same room as you 've a dream of being an asshole and a very sad one at that
1,the story is quite good and the characters play a very straight role with all their strengths,the only redeeming feature of this movie was his performance in the film which was very much like
1,yeah it 's just a good movie to,yeah this movie has the same name
1,all that 's said with the movie is that he,all the characters in this movie are just like
1,this is a very bad movie about a killer in the woods,this movie is about a group that is not so much a social
1,let your friends get it and then get back and let it go for the big fat boys to talk,let 's make sure there is another movie called a new series to explore and a very good one
1,furthermore i have to ask one of them,furthermore the film 's focus was not on all
1,one of her better acting jobs,one of the most interesting things about
1,in the end the only good thing that i can say for me,in my case i have to say that i loved every scene
1,she gets in trouble with a waitress and he,she also has to deal to prove it
1,particularly when it should not be a comedy,particularly when you get the feeling you 're seeing
1,i have n't seen it since then but it has become a lot harder,i have no problem of how this is the movie which i liked
1,the first time i watched this movie was i was laughing hysterically and i was laughing at,the story is told as simple as the characters are but they are really quite human
1,not even a couple of the good lines of acting could have saved this,not the greatest movie in my opinion but it is a total failure
1,i do n't want to give the movie some,i think the story was quite well developed
1,here it is a movie that 's supposed as a satire with some serious themes and a great story behind,here the director is trying very hard to get the viewer to sympathize with the characters in the beginning
1,besides the movie in the first 15 minutes or so you see a film from the director 's life that is so much more of a character,besides the fact that he did a nice enough job of putting up his job on a new one is a real stinker and he 's just so
1,like so many other films that have been released for a few years i have,like the first one there is n't a good scene between these three guys
1,the film is an exercise in the history that the filmmakers should be making,the story is a bit slow and it just lacks any of the usual elements
1,kusama plays the part very convincingly,kusama has not been a master of
1,his wife is a little girl with a different type of a younger love interest,his father does a really good job of showing us how we really care for him
1,let 's put it the raptors are all bad,let it know you 've got a real problem in
1,mystery science fiction movie starts with a good guy with a black shirt that is a bit,mystery science theater 3000 was n't bad enough to make it worth sitting down to see
1,in his attempt he 's just not a very likable actor either,in any event i would advise anyone who has not seen this film
1,having said a few things the music sucks,having been living in a building for a past
1,following the first of the first installments we see the last scene,following all that you can get the most irritating film buff
1,unfortunately if you do not know that in the movie it 's not because you do have the same level in it and it will always be better,unfortunately i was not expecting much from this movie and did it to the fullest as it has some of it 's flaws i do not know what it
1,as a result the film is not a very bad movie,as in the first movie this one is n't that bad
1,she was an excellent actress with great talent,she is a real person and has one thing
1,a group of people find themselves stranded at a party of the beach where the inhabitants of the town,a young boy is sent to an isolated house and the man who works at a haunted inn
1,also the movie is not that good,also the plot is a bit farfetched
1,appropriately enough the movie is not funny not funny but definitely worth a chuckle,appropriately shot are not only the characters but also the actors who play it the
1,he is a very human person he loves to have all that he is,he 's not so much a good actor but a very good one
1,as i said not the same as the first film,as far from life goes there 's no way to solve
1,is the scene of the crime between the three leads,is there a film out here who could n't be bothered
1,there is some action in this movie that is not the best,there was some funny scenes but the whole thing is so poorly done
1,i would rather watch the blair and roll version because i have the same reaction as i 've seen the movie so i will not let off,i am sorry that i did n't get to watch the show but the last time the movie came out was so bad because i was surprised how
1,310 the worst of its kind,310 ps the movie was pretty good
1,still this one is a great little gem of the classic series,still this movie is the greatest ever to come on tv because it
1,if you are a movie fan this film will be much better than your average movie,if your in your seat as you have seen the trailer it does not have any redeeming
1,you have never heard of it before,you can tell this was filmed on a
1,i ca n't wait to view that,i ca n't help but wonder if they
1,instead it takes itself too seriously as it is so inept it 's laughable,instead we get the impression of a woman who is in love at first and
1,and if you want to go to a movie where the only good guys you see are kids who want to,and the movie is one step above the average hollywood tv fare that has been forgotten on many many years
1,like all of the others i have the problem with this flick it,like other user films i thought she made one more memorable movie
1,i have a fondness for this film so the only people i have seen that i have ever liked,i just wish i had n't rented a book with the same movie that was so much better
1,things get worse from there and his mother,things get really complicated in the end
1,for fans that think it 's a film you can enjoy it,for those that have n't already you have not seen them and i
1,and the best thing is that you can see the film for the first 2030 minutes,and it should 've gotten to the end of the world instead of the man getting it
1,i 've never been a huge horror fan but in other words i have to disagree with another reviewer that this had to rank up against all the good things,i think the story does n't really have enough action elements to warrant you the enjoyment but the director did the trick to make a statement of it 's own point
1,for instance it makes you laugh at times that is n't very well done,for example when you do n't get a sense of being funny or not just
1,the story is just a little too long and is not worth commenting at all,the story of the movie was a little farfetched to begin with the plot was not
1,the story of the girl and the son 's wife is so believable,the movie was just bad and i really did n't like it
1,that 's why i do n't understand who was who to blame the script,that 's all there really are two other movies that are better than the matrix
1,the first half hour are just plain bad,the story was not as weak a bit of
1,she has to be the center of,she has never been seen before
1,i thought the script was very good and there was also a very enjoyable scene involving the man and the sister and the way that scene is a little bit long it,i ca only think i had seen the first 5 min of the show which i felt i was in for a good movie and i 'll tell you the characters
1,come on you 'll enjoy it more than just,come on guys are not all that bad
1,let 's face it it is the first movie i had seen before,let 's just say it is a movie that does not take place
1,an interesting idea of how the film 's success has been,an important question of how i feel about the film
1,also the film is an insult for all involved with the whole production,also the only good parts of the movie is the music and dance score
1,a very good cast and a great supporting performance from the actor that plays this character so much of a story as i was rooting and glad that he could carry this movie to his,a few of the actors appear to be trying on a different level but they are just plain awful and it 's not even the bad acting which makes it watchable to anyone else
1,a real stinker of his acting abilities,a lot of the film takes place as
1,unlike a lot on the other side of my seat it was pretty obvious,unlike i was the one to get a sense of humor and excitement
1,this is a very funny short and it is very entertaining but it 's,this film is so stupid i do have to laugh at this one
1,and this one did n't really deserve to win,and then when i found out that i was n't
1,director john frankenheimer is a master director whose sole purpose to do this circulation,director robert siodmak does a great work making this show worth a look
1,it 's like the writers have a,it was a very entertaining movie
1,i ca only not give up on this film,i was not aware of the plot but i was
1,the movie is pretty good as it has a decent atmosphere but it is not,the only redeeming feature of it was that they were actually trying hard and tried to
1,only two of the four leads are excellent,only two men are able to take up the
1,inspector gadget is the only character who is remotely memorable,inspector loomis is one of my favorites as a filmmaker who
1,now if you know it i am just glad that i have seen a more obscure version and i 've read it,now i just saw this movie at a local international movie festival and was shocked at how well it was made
1,the movie is very interesting but the movie is boring,the film is one long shot for the family and the
1,together the story is told in a very realistic manner,together is that it is a good movie because it has
1,it 's just stupid and boring,it 's also a pretty good movie
1,however for a bit more than a few reasons and,however a very bad idea of a bad movie
1,still in my opinion it was athat 's the story for people that are,still it 's a fine moviethat was the whole point of view
