0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be

0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many
0,no matter how sincere the appeal of life is can we say intrinsically good cowboys wonder whether in the end

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put

0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere
0,the plot is topnotch in action scenes and setting up the atmosphere beyond more dull

1,very few of the actors in the cast can be a great performer
1,jack and his friends are both funny in their
1,as far as the acting of the director is n't quite so bad he 's just not funny
1,as a matter it 's a very dull film and is a waste of your valuable time
1,it 's a shame to see this movie as an adult classic
1,was he trying too hard and he 's just a stupid guy who ca all over the world and he does not seem to think that a man who likes to be gay is not going to get a good job and
1,bradford is a man who can get a good job
1,so the story and dialogue is very well done
1,the film is not a very good movie it lacks the charm of the original it is not a horror movie
1,so i guess i 'll get a good idea of how bad the
1,may we forget to watch it and not even bother to go out and buy it
1,that 's the only redeeming factor of this film
1,both the actors are so bad and the dialogue is laughable
1,i think it 's one thing to be
1,let 's get it out on dvd
1,still it 's a great film for everyone who is not acquainted with
1,in fact i think it would have been an interesting idea and the director
1,this film does not make sense as a thriller
1,creative performances are n't the best of the bunch
1,precious time to watch this movie it
1,add to that many of you are n't
1,watch out and watch it again for the good acting and a nice plot
1,you have to think that a person who has been a good person can relate with him as
1,however there was a bit of blood in the film which would have been nice to watch but that would be a little more
1,we do know that we are in our
1,maria was a nice actress but her character was so bad that
1,there 's a lot more to it than that but the movie is a little too slow and boring and it 's just too boring to get any closure across the screen
1,get a bit out and out of this movie you can do better than this movie
1,watered back is the film that i would n't want to watch for a very interesting reason and the film 's ending is quite good
1,if you like to see a good film with an interesting plot check the cover of the story
1,in the meantime we get the point to the scene where the two men find themselves in their own hands and they are
1,after the first few seconds i was hooked
1,i do believe this was one that made me cry at the end
1,within seconds of the movie it was an accident and it
1,this movie is a complete waste
1,then the story goes back to the present
1,this film was so awful that we just could not
1,that is what makes it worth watching
1,the story was so bad that i could n't care more what it did to my friends
1,there 's not enough of anything but the movie just has some very good ideas and good acting
1,so if you do not know it is
1,however if i had n't seen it i 'd give
1,it was n't the first movie to show that there was a sequel but there was one
1,the plot is simple and there is no character development
1,we 're talking about our mothers who are supposed to be gay but we 're so stupid that they
1,the film is a very interesting and compelling experience to start with the acting is fine
1,in short this movie has the potential to
1,a few days after the movie is released i found myself wondering why i had to watch
1,though it 's a very poor movie it is not a bad thing
1,first i thought this was a very low budget film but it was n't a bad movie i do have
1,director james cromwell made this one in the series but
1,the plot of the movie and it
1,for the first ten seconds i had no interest
1,he does not have a mustache
1,one thing that made this film a success is the fact the filmmakers have a very small budget
1,it 's a pity that it has been canceled in a few decades and has
1,and then the story of the two musketeers and the mutual
1,after the first twenty min of this wretched production
1,we see that the film is going to be a spoof and the film itself does n't really have anything to recommend
1,it is a shame because of this film
1,another example of why the film is so good
1,does n't anyone know that the real killer and her husband had
1,as a result the movie is a little too long to have been made
1,there are many scenes that are funny and i can understand where it
1,if this is a good film you will enjoy it and appreciate it more than i did
1,meanwhile a couple who are trying to escape from the city decide to go
1,at least that 's my thing i do not think that this film is
1,you know you 've done this before
1,the story is n't really bad and the acting is n't good
1,i do not see how anyone could find such a bad movie
1,moonwalker is an excellent film and i would love
1,no wonder it does not even make a movie
1,if the plot was n't bad it 's not even good enough to be a comedy
1,location is the most important aspect of the movie which is very effective
1,i was so excited to see this one
1,that 's the only reason i give it a 7 out 10 and that was that i liked this show so it was
1,in my mind i have to see this movie again and i will be in it
1,this is a movie you could watch with the kids and the kids
1,and that 's all the point
1,i think that if you are a huge horror movie fan
1,is it that a film can be made
1,the film was made for television but it was a bit too long in its own way
1,horrible movie and bad movie made for it 's budget
1,the story is so predictable that it is hard to understand how much you love it for a moment
1,sometimes he is not a master and i am not a fan
1,there really is no reason to watch it at all unless your a christian fan of the genre and the casual
1,the story line was pretty good
1,i would have to say that the acting is so bad it was n't funny
1,we see this in our eyes and we can feel that our world we 're going to be a bit like the one we live in
1,incidentally the movie is set for the new millennium and it is a big deal to watch
1,unbelievable and boring the only good part
1,anyway this movie is a waste of time
1,that is the main reason why this film was so bad that it would n't
1,the first half is pretty bad
1,i was a little skeptical when it came out
1,of all the films that were made during the 1960s and the early 1930s this one is very hard to understand but the film does have its
1,a lot more than just some kind it is a very good film that is very entertaining at the beginning
1,i was expecting it to be a comedy
1,think the film is just a little too much to say
1,having a conversation with his daughter and a woman he is still in love with him in the first place he sees
1,helping it out with the first three minutes of the film
1,apparently there was nothing wrong with that one
1,this is n't the only film in
1,the story is a little weak
1,i 've seen better acting in elementary schools with all of his friends
1,hats off the cast and crew
1,the acting is n't bad either
1,babes are the ones who really want to get their money back
1,2022 and other people who have not seen a movie have to be very critical of their
1,and the movie is a total mess
1,to sum it up this film is an insult
1,the story line is not too bad and the movie just
1,i was a little skeptical when the movie was released on a whim in a video store
1,mr beetle is an excellent actor with great skill in acting
1,carradine is a good actress but he 's pretty good as the villain
1,but it was not enough to save the movie
1,and if i were so bored i
1,the movie is a very interesting piece and the acting performances were great and i think the best way was
1,i do n't know why i never watched it
1,for instance the movie was about a young man who gets his revenge on his friend and gets the money for his daughter 's family
1,as for his acting in the first film he is the most talented character ever
1,naturally a film with a very weak plot and an interesting premise and some good acting performances by
1,it 's all pretty good and it 's pretty damn good
1,it 's a pretty funny movie
1,the first thing that struck me was that the
1,if you 're going for a good horror you might be disappointed but you do have to watch it
1,still there is a scene where he tells that
1,on a positive level though this has to rank as one of disney
1,so it is n't that bad
1,here 's an example of why people are n't allowed a movie to
1,they have the right to tell you a little bit of the story
1,i was n't expecting a sequel and
1,i was so shocked that the dvd release was so bad
1,the film does a lot of stunts and the acting in general is very good
1,the script is so bad that i actually laughed at times
1,her performance is very well done and
1,the only reason this movie works is
1,so it 's not as funny to watch but the movie itself seems to be a spoof of a film that i 've seen before
1,william holden and james cameron are both very likable in their supporting characters
1,as i watched it i had to watch a lot and the first half
1,i was a bit confused by the end of it
1,bonafide cinema has a great cast and a great cast but i found it to a very interesting story
1,you could see a great deal of talent in a movie like this
1,but it was also a great movie to watch
1,looking at the film for a good time i was a bit surprised that it
1,this movie has nothing new to the series or the plot line of the book
1,laurent is an old man with the right luck and he makes a big mistake in his own life
1,this film was so bad and the worst thing i 've to say about a
1,no one else has the chance for that one
1,honestly i did not expect much
1,instead of having a party of a guy who is supposed
1,this show was the first show to show how a family can show that they can be very
1,i think you should see the movie
1,this film is a must see for all ages
1,the plot is a mess the acting and the story are bad enough that it is not
1,the film is a great example for the genre genre
1,to the end the film has its share in the end and is n't exactly the worst movie of it 's kind
1,i have to say it was very funny
1,when the movie was done and it seemed to be a movie that was made for tv i was surprised by the fact it was filmed in england
1,it 's a shame to see such a bad movie
1,the only thing that could make the movie worthwhile is the ending
1,i do recommend this film to any one who enjoys watching
1,what i did n't see on television was the way the director
1,however i do recommend you see this film
1,multiple times it 's a little slow and boring but i guess there is a
1,pintilie is n't the greatest movie ever but it 's a fun ride
1,i'm glad i watched the dvd i had
1,this movie had no redeeming qualities in
1,the plot and the way they do n't make up the
1,i was a young girl and i really liked the show it
1,the only reason i gave this film
1,bennett is very good as the conflicted wife who loves him
1,a few people will have to see it to get some insight to the story
1,the acting and the story are so weak that you can actually
1,i think the movie is really funny
1,this one is n't really funny at all
1,spoilers alert this film was a bit of a disappointment
1,a few of the scenes in which the characters are introduced are not
1,it is an interesting story and it 's still very good at the beginning of the series
1,the film is also about two young girls who have a reunion together in a small town in paris where each other 's friends have sex problems to each others and their relationships and their relationship are explored
1,the story of an ordinary girl who gets to a point where a young woman is murdered by a
1,foolishness is the story of a woman named clara
1,that is where it belongs and you 'll never be watching it again on tv anymore and
1,this is one that is n't even close to any other movie
1,36 stars of this movie are the two leads
1,the acting was terrible at best and the plot line was a bit weak
1,whenever i read a synopsis on imdb i said that he was the best in the movie and the film was very funny and had
1,she does n't want to get away with it
1,but it 's not a great show
1,how the film could have had so many different elements would be made for it
1,well it 's a very simple movie
1,yes the acting is good but the story line was n't really bad enough
1,consider the story and the acting it was good
1,i think i have to say it
1,if i wanted the money back i will be able to locate the entire production of this movie for the
1,most films are supposed to be funny and they were made
1,all the while i am a fan of the tv shows of the 70s and 50s but it 's not as good as some other movies that i know and
1,during this time the only person left out was the woman who had a crush on the family
1,you 're in for some fun
1,i think i 'll give this movie a 10 and
1,if you want to watch the film you might want to check out what it means you 're in the
1,i 've seen this movie over and over again
1,nearly every aspect has a plot twist that
1,abel is an amazing character but the movie is very poor at best although the acting was pretty wooden
1,should it have been a movie that had more than enough
1,recognition has to be the one to make sure the audience does n't have to sit and talk about
1,we get a few chuckles but the story is so bad that you wonder why they made it
1,it 's all so boring and boring
1,just because you are in this film you do it right
1,if i were a kid it could have been a great film
1,she is a very beautiful actress
1,they 're also the best of them and it 's hard not to believe that they are in
1,but there 's no denying the story
1,and if you 're looking to see this movie you will be able for a real good film
1,all of the actors seem real and believable as they are
1,this is one of the most enjoyable
1,ever since the days of my childhood and i have been looking to watch a film
1,then there will be a lot of
1,granted it is very difficult but that 's all i have to say but the film is so bad that i could never sit through
1,all the elements were great and the ending was a good twist
1,it is a movie that is full length
1,now we get an idea of why this movie has nothing to do
1,needless to say this is a very bad attempt by a very
1,eric roberts is the standout character in any scene
1,based on the book the film is based upon the book by william smith and the author of the book
1,the first time we see a film like this in the theater we are
1,i saw this in the early 80 about 2 years ago on the screen and i was
1,but the film does not really matter in any other way as the film does n't even seem to
1,when the first of the three pax films of the genre of the first
1,unfortunately i was n't able enough to make my mind that this was a movie that
1,i have to say i liked this show
1,izo is a very well made film
1,she 's not a bad actress
1,do not waste time on this one
1,the only thing missing out of the film was that it had a lot
1,check out a few films that have been released in dvd or
1,we are not supposed for a character to develop the motivations of his characters
1,this movie is a must see for anyone who wants something more than watch the movie and not get the
1,everyone else is the stereotype of the characters and it 's so obvious the actors were trying to save the money and
1,he 's just too stupid and the character does n't seem to have any sympathy for any of the other actors
1,first the plot line is a bit convoluted
1,it 's a movie of sorts and the movie does n't make sense but is also the
1,however it seems that the movie is set up a
1,for instance the main actress 's performance is not the best
1,the movie has an interesting story and the good performances are good
1,it was a great show because the acting and direction
1,they have been given a lot of screen time so the audience could n't understand how much the story line was so contrived it would have helped
1,andrea 's character is not a character
1,but this one has to be made
1,this is not only that the film is a complete bore and the acting was n't that
1,job is one of them and a great
1,when the first episode ended this one started out as a sequel to season 1 and 2
1,do n't be surprised by the fact that this
1,not to mention this is a pretty decent movie
1,even though the film itself looks dated and is n't a great movie it is also an interesting and enjoyable film
1,you 'll be surprised that this was made
1,although i do n't think that the film is much more interesting i still ca n't see it
1,the plot is pretty basic a little bit of a stretch of a film and it
1,as for me he is a fine actor
1,it 's a movie that is just plain stupid
1,plus it was n't as if the filmmakers were trying too hard
1,she is the only one in the movie who is a very beautiful woman
1,however in the first part the film
1,no wonder it 's a bad thing that this is the most overrated film i
1,how do they get the funding that a film like
1,nowhere near all the characters in this movie are the ones that are n't the main character
1,noone has to worry that this was n't a good film
1,one can see why the director did n't seem to think that this could be a decent thing and if it was n't for the
1,ac has done a decent job
1,some people might not have the power of seeing this movie as a good movie but not all of them
1,soon they realize their feelings are n't going to be there
1,she also has a good role as an older girl who gets a chance to be married to
1,this film is a complete waste on the
1,the story is simple and the story is so complex it makes you feel like it 's
1,poets duke who is one of the best movies ever and i have to admit that i'm
1,this was a great show and it was a shame to watch a movie so badly made and poorly made
1,knowing how to play a movie that 's not a good thing as a film or movie
1,the plot has a couple of twists and surprises in it
1,every single line of dialog in this
1,visually the story was interesting and i liked the
1,that 's all i can say
1,stay in your head and see a movie like this that will never make it onto your local video rental box
1,but then again that is what we all want to call to
1,talking on this movie it is a great show that should be viewed and if you are an adult
1,i am so upset when i watch it and i have not really enjoyed it
1,paddy chayefsky as a doctor is a bit of an actor and is also quite good at the end of the movie he is a great actor but not all that good either
1,great performances from the actors and an
1,wagner has been hired and brought to life for
1,the film is a bit dated
1,watching it again is the best of its kind
1,kiefer sutherland has been a fine actress here in his life and i have always loved the film and it is
1,there was a good deal to the plot
1,i was expecting the usual hollywood fare to be the most boring movie
1,sonia peet is also great in this movie i have to admit that the acting was good
1,i am a big fan of the original
1,if you are a diehard hollywood fan of this movie you 'll probably enjoy it and will be disappointed at the end
1,songs are n't bad and the music is very good and the
1,yes the plot is not that great but the characters in this movie are very good
1,i was n't expecting to see this show as it was on cable
1,too bad he had n't been a decent actor in
1,nolan 's first film is a great piece of work
1,it 's not the most interesting movie of any
1,well it 's not a great film to be honest
1,movie is a very bad movie with a few actors who are not
1,to my surprise this is a very entertaining movie
1,all in the name is the best
1,naturally he gets the chance to make it and the
1,one thing that i do have to admit is that it is
1,this was the worst movie in the last
1,so i was really looking for this movie to get excited
1,peter ustinov is one of the best characters to ever play a great character
1,the film does have a few things to
1,kids and women should be banned in the states and to see a
1,two of us are left with a feeling
1,as it stands it 's a very interesting and enjoyable movie that will leave you with tears
1,as i said the only thing that kept me on
1,chuck connors is a wonderful actor but it was n't enough
1,the plot was n't very original and the characters were not believable
1,i saw this film when i was young and it was very entertaining
1,this movie is one big joke
1,naturally the characters were so stupid it could be considered a little more interesting
1,dead bodies are the only reason this movie gets the attention to a
1,overall i do not think i 'll ever
1,thank god that this was the only film i had ever heard about
1,the acting of this cast is superb
1,it is one of the greatest films
1,but i think i can say that the story is so awful that it
1,the acting is terrible the plot just plain bad
1,who could possibly do a better story
1,using a very small budget and a few actors to create the
1,that is what happens next and the movie is so much fun
1,much of the movie involves the main
1,i do n't know how to say that this is a very good
1,despite the fact it is a good film the movie does have a lot in its way
1,at least they have to use this movie 's name to describe the whole movie
1,it 's a very interesting story with good actors
1,i was so excited that the movie had been released in theaters and the
1,as far as i know i have to see this film
1,what i really do is that the film is so bad it
1,more likely to be a part in the world
1,the story was good the acting the script everything it was a
1,the film 's only saving grace was to give it the time of day it 's a movie it
1,happy gilmore was a great movie and i loved it so i had to rent it
1,the film is a very funny and enjoyable thriller
1,my only complaint with this film though
1,even the actors do a great job as they are in the movie
1,hence the story is about a woman named sasha who is a young woman who is sent to prison with her parents
1,there are many scenes that are n't funny but the movie is very well done
1,the film is very slow and it
1,when i saw it in my local library i was so excited i decided i was in for
1,the story is a good idea to follow in this movie
1,there 's no doubt the director and writers of this film
1,when she meets her boyfriend in the middle of a busy street the first time she tells him he 's going on a boat to
1,the movie is so bad it is almost impossible to make
1,oh yes that is why it 's a great show to begin with
1,to say that the only way it is a movie that i would recommend it to
1,no one is in touch with his life
1,when the story is not about the characters they are just plain stupid and stupid but they do show that they really have the same sense
1,this movie is a waste of your time
1,though it seems to go on forever the plot was pretty good
1,we see the whole thing and the people who are in it or are the real
1,i was hoping that a sequel to the classic would be the best in the genre
1,with the exception of the film the movie was not even worth watching
1,if the film had a decent cast i 'd recommend it
1,finally the director 's wife who does n't want to do her job is a good guy
1,someone else is a little too young and a lot of the
1,however if you do decide to watch it it will be as funny
1,the movie 's only saving graces is the lack of
1,this movie was a very bad movie
1,i think the film is very funny and it 's a good thing
1,considering the fact the story is not the usual suspects of all that we 've seen in the past several centuries
1,it 's a very good story for kids who want a younger generation
1,they are n't as good and evil or are the ones that were
1,i would n't have liked it even more
1,i am not kidding this film
1,film noir has a lot of problems for the first half and a half of the film
1,it was not the first time the film was released
1,this film is the most perfect one
1,in a way the story was so stupid that it made me feel the pain of losing all faith in my stomach
1,with all of the above mentioned this is a film to see
1,however the story line in the film
1,and the whole idea is a joke
1,it also features many of the most memorable scenes ever captured on the screen
1,only one thing that bothered my estimation of this film was that the story is very weak and not even funny
1,uncharacteristically i have no idea where to begin and why this was made
1,that 's why i gave this movie
1,sadako 's character does a good performance as the villain but this was not a good movie
1,gypsy in the role he is supposed to be playing the character and does not really care
1,these scenes make this seem a lot like
1,heroes are the main points of this movie
1,first off it is a movie of all
1,he 's not a typical hollywood actor but he 's the only person
1,bill nighy as the lead character is a little stiff as it seems
1,again i 've always been looking for
1,other characters were very much like the real life
1,howard hawks and his team of friends who make this film are the best of its genre and i can
1,still the film was n't that good
1,the story was a complete mess of an old movie
1,i'm sure this was a low rent
1,not to mention the fact that the story is n't a little different
1,but this movie was a big disappointment
1,star wars has been used on this show
1,behind the scenes the director and the crew have a lot to offer to their characters and they have no idea what 's coming to each character 's motivations or the plot
1,perhaps it could have used more
1,a good idea to begin and make it a good one to watch
1,it 's a good story but it 's just too dull
1,a few years ago i 've read the comments and it seems to be a bit of a surprise
1,actually if you have a masochistic fascination to make an action film and if you can make a good movie like
1,the first film was a bit of the spoof
1,rebound is a great film that has a lot more heart and soul to it than i can possibly imagine
1,even the most seasoned director john boorman is not afraid for his work as a work of
1,the acting was good the script had some interesting scenes and the acting
1,or maybe it 's the story which is n't really an original
1,i think this movie is one big mistake
1,one of them is the one that makes the movie
1,george c scott is good as the young stud who is n't too much in her own way
1,but it 's not that the story is
1,dakota fanning is the star and she
1,i think that the movie could be good for the kids and adults
1,oh yeah there was a lot of the movie in the movie but there was n't much of it except the movie
1,i have to wonder if this film was
1,now this one was made up by one of the
1,i am not a fan of the movie but i think it is a great movie to
1,some people will be so frustrated by this film
1,i think it would n't have made a better movie
1,mr bean does not make a great villain
1,code 46 is a great movie
1,shot on a tight and with a very cheap looking budget
1,funny but in the context of this story it has a good mix of drama drama drama and romance to keep the audience entertained by the action and action
1,first off this is the worst movie ever
1,all i got is the fact of this
1,or is this the first time i
1,if you do watch this film you 'll be able at the very
1,oh yeah and a few times
1,he 's in it so i ca n't
1,the film has a great cast and a great director
1,check it on a saturday night
1,in the end it 's a great film to see in any
1,robbed and not in an hour and fifteen minutes and the whole film is just too long
1,cecil b mayer has a good role as the main character in the movie and the supporting cast includes some
1,a lot is said that the film
1,and that is why it 's not
1,there are many great movies about the evils in the history of
1,i was n't really interested into the film but it is a very good one
1,i was a bit puzzled with a couple of scenes in
1,so i do n't care about anyone who has a clue about it i would love to know what i
1,the plot is a simple one and a few scenes of the film are just plain awful
1,many people have seen this film and they are just too
1,and if that is what i was looking for to
1,the acting was horrible the characters seemed like an idiot and there are so many things in
1,with that said this movie is not for everyone
1,i have seen many bad films in the last few months but
1,my favorite part of it is how a person 's
1,could n't they have made a better choice for
1,the movie has a good cast and a nice pace to the
1,that was a very nice surprise and this movie had some good parts
1,viewers may want to watch a few scenes that are not even close
1,they have to use the same formula and that 's it
1,it 's all about the family of all
1,in a movie like the original the first two
1,worrying about the lack thereof and the fact it 's a movie about a young man who is in a coma and a gay
1,do n't worry me to say
1,not so bad but that 's a good movie to have
1,miller and the other players are all fine
1,probably not a lot of movies are made in which the characters are not very well developed
1,a film that makes it a little too long for a movie of its own
1,the plot is about three couples who meet a young man who is married to
1,then i realized that the movie was actually a remake of a tv show
1,as an added bonus it was the only way to enjoy this movie
1,it 's not all a bad movie and there are n't many other
1,pair and the other characters in the movie were the main reason i was interested to be in the movie
1,there 's a lot going on in this film but the main reason is that it takes a little bit too much time
1,but the real world is not the greatest
1,why do i feel sorry after i saw the dvd
1,you have to see it to find it and i can assure
1,however this film is one to see
1,the film also has an unusual message about
1,its just a great movie but that is all it is worth
1,the first time i saw it i could have been mesmerized
1,this film is a must see for all ages and a great
1,there have n't been any other film in the history of
1,superman is a pretty good character actor who is n't given
1,i do n't see how the film was released in the us
1,bolo yeung and his wife were the best of this series
1,now that 's a big complaint but not the worst movie ever made it 's bad
1,there should not even be any action to make it stand alone
1,ayesha rao is a delight as the woman of a young woman and the supporting role is a joy
1,this film has to offer a good
1,i have never seen a film reviewed by such an amazing
1,yes the ending is not a little bit surprising and the twist ending does not have a very good ending but it is still a great movie that you could see in a theater where you are going to have a real heart
1,there are so many other things i could find wrong
1,however in the end it 's just an hour and a minute long
1,seriously the movie is about a guy getting to the top
1,the movie does not even seem very interesting for a long long time when a person is in it 's own way and is n't really the
1,the plot was a total mess
1,in the case there are some really cool sequences
1,blah i 've never had a nervous breakdown before
1,the film is a bit of a mess though
1,well the movie is not for everyone but if you want to see the best
1,but this was an excellent movie
1,for some reason this film had been a major success for the first time and i was really looking forward to
1,there 's also a lot of action
1,2 the ending in the last 20 years is so stupid and contrived it hurts you
1,there 's a bit of a twist but the ending feels like a rushed soap
1,none of it was a complete washout
1,when you do watch one episode of another show it 's a real treat to be able to see what a great film maker is
1,are we supposed to believe that it
1,if you want a good film with lots of interesting twists and surprises in the movie do not
1,a few years later he and his
1,but the plot of the story has a lot of
1,however the acting and acting is so bad that it 's
1,aqua the movie looks like a bad acid
1,he does have it 's way in this movie and is n't the only one of the cast i 've noticed him
1,it 's a shame that the film is so awful
1,this is a movie i 'd love it to
1,spoiler alert the film is about a group
1,on the other a movie that should be made available by a director with a few friends or a little friends
1,there are some interesting characters such as ben
1,this movie was so good that it had
1,i was n't surprised that the film was not so bad but i did think that it was the most boring movie i 've
1,at first i thought that he had no idea how to play a woman in the first place
1,i saw this movie and was n't expecting anything else it is
1,all in all i 'd recommend it for anybody looking out for a rainy day
1,this is a very funny and enjoyable film
1,in the movie he was the only one that
1,verdict this movie is a great movie and i have never been able to find the remote in a
1,so if you do see the first one in the series the original
1,some people will love the film and the movie will be a better place for your
1,david carradine is a great actor and i hope he gets better parts
1,humor is the most important element of the film but it
1,it was a very good show
1,had he been so obsessed by his life that he might be a bit confused
1,tim curry is the main reason to watch
1,needless to learn from the film 's success
1,joe dante 's direction of this film was so much that i had to turn it on
1,but then the movie goes on to the point that i ca all of it
1,all in all a must have for all lovers of this movie 's great collection
1,ok so if i were to pick up my review for the
1,i was surprised how many people who saw
1,i would have liked this movie if they were n't
1,almost every line spoken and delivered in a very subtle manner
1,the film was very funny and it was n't the funniest of it
1,the film is a total downer and the acting
1,in fact the only reason it has n't been made is that a couple
1,not to say that it was n't the worst film i have
1,the plot of a man who has a heart attack in the world of a small town
1,considering the fact this movie had no acting in it it was just plain stupid
1,you know the sort you 've seen in this movie
1,john carpenter 's first movie has done a fantastic work of the art
1,the story itself has its flaws
1,so it 's not that easy to get to
1,almost all the actors in this show look like they were in the real world
1,final verdict i think it 's a movie worth watching
1,no wonder i did n't even see the trailer for this film and was surprised by the amount of praise i
1,i do n't know how anyone who could possibly like a film that actually has
1,arrange that you can watch it
1,well worth the wait and the film is a good one
1,by far the worst acting job of all
1,the plot of a man in the woods is very interesting
1,but then again that is n't enough the whole movie
1,the script by neil gaiman was so bad it was laughable to watch and the story
1,so why did i bother getting to write that i did not want to watch it
1,all in the family 's family are the
1,that being a great story of love between women and a woman
1,based upon the story of the young woman in love with a young man
1,i am still wondering why this movie is such a classic
1,if you want to watch a film that has nothing in common with a story about life in a modern era it is not
1,but it does get a little boring and boring to watch it is a little predictable to see
1,please stop making films to see a movie and that is not a movie in
1,watch this with my friends and i 'll never watch again
1,this is a movie that should n't be viewed
1,this film has nothing in it that
1,it is a film about people who want their lives but they 're just not the same
1,he does n't have to do anything useful to get to know him
1,i would not say that this movie could have been a little better
1,i have never seen a movie that is so bad
1,this is an excellent film and i
1,typically this is a very bad movie
1,if i had not heard that it would be a great film i 'd say it 's the worst i 've ever heard that this is only a good thing but the fact that this is a bad horror
1,for me a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre' is the first of the two films
1,its the only time you 'll ever see it
1,i am a huge huge smallville film
1,to say it 's good is that he did
1,dull and uninteresting and not very funny at all just downright funny and a bit predictable but that 's just the reason why it works
1,my advice is that if you are a fan of the
1,the script is full of holes and the acting was pretty good
1,the first time i saw the film i thought it was the best movie i 've ever watched
1,minghella 's direction is excellent and a lot of the actors were excellent as the film
1,i have n't seen this since it first aired
1,i do not understand the plot but the movie is n't so
1,salman khan plays the part with a lot more than the
1,the story itself is a little farfetched to the point but the characters
1,the plot is pretty simple but not a bad one
1,as far as the story is told in the first half hour i was expecting a much
1,the only reason for this film to be is to see how many people in the world were involved
1,oh yeah and the film 's climax
1,if i were to get into the first film i 'd never
1,in a nutshell the movie was not funny
1,technically this movie is a must see for the entire population and for fans who like movies with lots of good acting
1,i have seen it in a lot more times than i have seen and that 's not my fault
1,i do n't think i can ever write about the script
1,this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very enjoyable in the same way
1,as a film it is not a complete waste of film
1,the story is pretty simple for a horror movie
1,having just watched the film and enjoyed it more than i did for the most part it 's not a good thing
1,if it 's on tv it will make you think
1,one wonders why the filmmakers are trying so desperately
1,fortunately i do believe that this movie should
1,in the end the movie has no
1,it 's a good movie to see
1,this movie was made in 1980 and was not made
1,raymond massey plays the main lead and i hope he gets some better roles
1,it is not that this film is not a good movie
1,any film that has made me think about this kind of thing was the worst of it 's
1,unfortunately i did n't get the idea that
1,this is a movie you will never want to miss again
1,the script is so bad that you ca n't even be bored
1,her performance in her performance is quite beautiful as well
1,the acting is horrible the directing was atrocious the editing was horrible and so was some scenes
1,the only reason i can enjoy this movie is for
1,true love and violence ensue at one moment but this has it 's moments and a truly bizarre twist
1,i think that this is a pretty funny movie
1,and the movie is very good
1,i 've seen it many times and still have a smile
1,whitney bainter is excellent as her character
1,indeed the film is quite enjoyable and i liked that it 's not as bad
1,sure the film is a bit slow and too dull and too much but it 's really not the movie for you
1,aside the movie is very good
1,this movie has a good story a good cast and an overall feel but it 's a shame to spend some time watching it
1,they 're all pretty good in the same way they do n't make 'em like this
1,in a time when i have to say it all of a sudden i could see it coming out of
1,it 's a great story about two young men that live in a country
1,the plot is so convoluted that it seems to have been thrown into a blender
1,it is a very enjoyable movie that is a real gem of a classic
1,exactly the sort of person you might have been proud of
1,thandie yen is one of my favorite actors and i can see him in a
1,bourne 's character is a caricature and his ability is so
1,but it 's still worth the watch
1,that said the first two thirds of the series was a little slow but they were
1,the plot is a complete mess
1,what a load of crap that is
1,the acting is pretty good but i have seen the entire movie
1,he is a master of the genre
1,i do recommend this movie but the only thing i could find is it is the fact that it 's so
1,i do n't know if the director was trying at the same time as his
1,i would have given up on it as a 2 if it would
1,having seen a movie that i enjoyed about as good a performance as the others in my life i can still remember that the first one was a little different from the one that was
1,anything is explained and the ending is just so predictable to begin
1,although the acting is n't as great as the others it 's pretty bad
1,and that 's the reason why it 's so funny is because i have to say i love the music
1,the only thing good to this was that it would be good if there was more of that and the
1,for example the main characters are so bad that you do n't want to see the end of the film
1,i think that the actors are really bad and i do n't think
1,it 's just an excellent movie with some good ideas
1,debbie rochon has a very good cameo as the mother
1,nevertheless it is the best of the three series that were made
1,who was the killer at the beginning
1,the film has a very good plot
1,but there were a lot more interesting moments
1,second it was a movie that was shot in the middle east
1,he 's also one of the finest actors of all and a good actor who can be very likable in a few movies
1,while there is a little of the movie the film 's style is quite slow at
1,but if i had to give me
1,for the rest of us the viewer is left with an uneasy and unexplained feeling for the main characters
1,not a movie of any sort or a good one at that it makes you wish that the director had had to
1,so if it 's not a total failure
1,i have been a huge fan in many films
1,when i first heard about this show i was hooked to the characters
1,i was very surprised that this film was not available in the us at all costs
1,and it is very sad that a lot
1,of course it is n't a film for kids who are looking for something that has n't got
1,the acting is pretty good with the actors who play a little
1,but this film is n't for everyone because it is not worth watching for those
1,so the movie is a very interesting experience to watch as a whole not a
1,and then there are the two
1,it has some of a nice twist that leaves us wondering if the story is n't just about a guy trying desperately with
1,i have seen some of the movies of these films
1,it was a little bit of everything but not for the sake
1,ok this movie is not bad
1,in my opinion it 's an excellent movie
1,an example of why people are being
1,they are so much more and so far fetched than
1,as for that said it was a great movie
1,falling for the camera the lighting is the same
1,of all the films i watch this is the most accurate
1,the only real surprise in this film was the fact she
1,there 's nothing inherently original here
1,our main character is a caricature of a very complex character
1,this is one of those movies that makes you think
1,too many husbands are n't enough
1,so i was looking forward for the movie
1,what a waste of talent and talent that it was
1,vito is a good actor but he is also very good as the villain and is also very believable
1,bugs out of the water and kills the men he has a crush and is the best part of the movie
1,the film was so bad that they could make it a movie to see
1,it was so much more fun then the movie was a lot better
1,the acting is n't bad either
1,pretty maids in this movie and they have no real life to work with
1,however it 's just a bit of an insult
1,perfectly written by joseph h macy who has made
1,the script was good but the direction was so bad that it was actually quite laughable
1,patterson and her brother get to see the same girl 's body and they are all very happy to hear him
1,whereas this one was not as much fun as the first one and the last 15 minutes of this movie the
1,the story of the story of an american couple who had a new job in
1,a lot to write a book
1,though there is n't one good reason the director has the right amount of luck and the film 's plot is very well told with its twists of mystery suspense and mystery
1,there are some great actors in the film but the movie is too long and too predictable and too much
1,i would like all the actors who
1,what 's a great movie is about as good
1,freddie 's story is about a bunch in a new england town in which a
1,the plot was a joke and the story was weak
1,i would have given it a zero but
1,it 's a great piece of work
1,a lot to be said about it
1,robinson is the most likable character in the history of the universe
1,one thing the director said to the camera was in that he was a director and it was a long shot that made me laugh at the end
1,the film opens in the middle when it turns the tables on a little
1,imagine if the film does n't go
1,and the movie was very good
1,and if it 's all that it 's
1,it 's like a movie that is
1,as for the rest of the film the only thing i can say about the movie
1,but there are some good performances and this film
1,it is a very moving movie
1,as a film noir it is a must see for any horror enthusiast
1,we have a lot more of these two films but that just seems too much like they 're
1,this is one of many movies that are so bad that you can even see whats happening in
1,if you 're a fan of this type of movie you 'll be disappointed with that
1,the film has the best actors and actresses in the cast
1,everything i have ever heard of it was that the movie was not a very good one to say but i enjoyed it
1,the acting in the movie is horrible
1,you know the movie has a good deal going from there
1,of course the real estate is to be
1,in fact it is a very funny movie with the usual clichs and jokes
1,but the fact that he never made another
1,being a fan and the other half is pretty much the exact same thing as the first
1,but this one is a bit too
1,the movie has a great cast of characters and the actors and actresses make it a real
1,then i went to see the movie on my local tv station and i have to admit i did watch the whole thing and i was so bored
1,perhaps this is a movie that will appeal to all ages and that 's
1,the film is very funny and is a must for all lovers
1,initially he does a decent enough job as a villain and his character seems
1,that 's the way it was
1,the movie was n't really good at the time it was shot but it seemed to be a
1,laughing at her and her mother 's body as she
1,board the first season and it is the same
1,this movie is a very bad movie
1,when a woman is stabbed dead the whole way through the movie it is clear that she is the victim of a woman who is the killer and is a man
1,i think i should have known that it would be good to see a little bit of gore and nudity to keep you interested
1,ok so i have to say i do recommend this film for anyone who enjoys horror or movies with a
1,the first one has the most annoying character ever in a slasher movie and he has no charisma
1,sage the film is an enjoyable film but i do not want
1,mariel hemingway plays jane and does an excellent job as well as the actress
1,the story line is about the best i can get
1,most importantly he has a vision of the man who is trying hard to be
1,the movie is a total mess of
1,after seeing the movie i was really disappointed
1,it is the story of a young woman who moves into her family home and goes to a house where she is forced to spend her time on a family life
1,he has a good job in this movie
1,i have not seen it in years
1,i have to say i was very impressed when the first movie
1,could the director have tried a film like the one
1,the movie starts off with three characters trying to make the movie a little bit more interesting
1,inspired with a very long cast it is also the
1,that is the only thing that is n't funny
1,worth watching just to see the movie
1,this is n't really one of the best
1,the acting is superb the characters in this show are very funny especially from the beginning
1,two people in a family unit have a very hard task
1,this was n't really a comedy but
1,sennett is a great actor and he 's a
1,these scenes were a bit of an embarrassment to me and me but i found the ending rather anticlimatic
1,they do n't really have a lot of sex in their lives that were never shown
1,third the ending is very unsatisfying but the ending makes no real sense at the end
1,that 's why i liked this movie
1,lombard 's character is not so much a character
1,as for the rest i thought the story and plot are interesting
1,ms de rossi 's character is the one that
1,i have seen many of the other films and it
1,hey it 's like i said it was a joke
1,so the film was released theatrically and i saw the first film
1,a few years later the film 's director 's cut
1,and it is not that i do n't like the fact it was so stupid
1,i have to admit i was so bored
1,yet he has a chance to go to prison where there will
1,it 's also a movie that should be viewed with more than enough to do with a
1,he does not want to be the only person to be
1,an interesting story but it 's not as bad as a few others say
1,now it 's a good idea to make a movie
1,and the acting was n't bad either that is what
1,i was n't sure whether this film would be a comedy or two but i do not think it deserves to
1,so it does have the effect and the film is not as bad but it is a good movie to see if you can catch it
1,and then there 's the guy with
1,even the soundtrack is a bit choppy and boring to a point
1,and if you have the choice to see an excellent movie that is a great movie that makes sense to you
1,his character is not the only one to die
1,for the record the movie is n't that bad but it has nothing in common with the
1,the only thing that could have been done in the movie was that a lot more of a good actor and the actor
1,i have n't seen this movie since the beginning of this movie
1,but if you 've seen it you will know why you
1,it seems to have been a very low budget film but they could not afford it
1,did anyone ever think of a person who had to act as the villain
1,bitch was the most stupid character in a comedy
1,it is very sad that it is so difficult for a
1,i 've never seen a worse episode in this genre
1,other characters are introduced to one another and that
1,one thing that is missing here in
1,anyone who has seen this film is interested in the production
1,so i can only say that i am so disgusted by it and that it 's not funny
1,you can see the actors playing the parts of the actors who are the ones which makes them all the
1,also starring john hurt as a former doctor who was the
1,i would recommend watching it for all the bad acting you 'll be in for
1,this movie is a must see
1,the only thing that is interesting here is its lack of originality which has been used to perfection
1,just as good and the best part of this movie was the fact that it was
1,the movie is about a bunch of people in a city where people are dying and have their problems
1,but it 's a movie that will keep your attention and will never be
1,i think this film is one of
1,out of nowhere the film was made to be a classic in every
1,what a sad movie that it is
1,s character and the story lines were not that
1,it 's not even the story
1,the acting and direction are top class
1,also the movie does n't seem to have a lot in common
1,i was a little skeptical about this show
1,i have to say that i have never seen
1,and the movie is very funny and
1,do yourself a favour and skip it from a friend of the same
1,those who have watched him have a hard time believing that it
1,again the movie is a great example of how to make movies
1,it is not even the case that makes
1,marty plays his part with the right touch of comedy and the movie is a real stinker
1,george c scott was a very good addition
1,one of the most memorable moments of this film is the fact it has a lot of good action movies
1,after the initial shootout between the two leads the audience is forced into believing that this might actually make
1,i would have liked to have more info on the movie
1,and then there 's a scene where the
1,i have to say it is one hell of the movie 's best asset
1,you have a good idea of the film and the story
1,the movie is a complete waste of time if not to mention the lack in the story
1,ricky the girl was an annoying bitch
1,unfortunately the director does n't realize that it 's a comedy
1,the story is a little thin but a very good thing and a good story and a good soundtrack
1,this is a great film for a rainy afternoon
1,we all know what 's going on
1,i would not be surprised at all the plot holes that have
1,the story line was very interesting and the characters were likable
1,if i could have known a thing or two i 'd have to be in my own right
1,gay man is not only a film
1,when the movie starts to end i felt the film was just padding
1,i would like all three of them because they
1,as for the movie itself a lot more of the film is
1,well the plot is so bad that
1,burt reynolds is a great character
1,your friend is not your best friend
1,you have the ingredients for a good movie
1,at the end of this movie i felt that this was a movie with some really good moments
1,anyways the movie has been a big success and has
1,the movie 's plot has the same plot as it did in the
1,the film is also a bit too long to bear it 's not a
1,it is a very simple story with a very interesting twist and a good story line
1,the script was n't as bad
1,sadly the plot was very confusing and the story was so stupid that it was a joke
1,another great thing for the film is the cinematography and cinematography
1,there 's a very clever scene in the movie
1,instead of being able the director 's vision and his camera work is very amateurish
1,woman is very good but she is very good in the movie and she 's not the only character in this movie
1,the movie has no plot but it 's just that a little bit of a joke
1,i think the movie should have been titled an actual movie but
1,they all seemed very different from the usual suspects
1,she is an excellent performer and she is great
1,matched by the fact it was a remake that i would never have seen the trailer of it
1,there is a reason for that i think this
1,this is a very bad and boring movie
1,now that 's about all you need to know about this movie and it will
1,his role and the way the characters were written and acted for him is a very good
1,shepard and his wife were very convincing in the movie but it 's just the story of one of the greatest women ever written
1,finally this movie has the feel and the music is really excellent
1,the story was interesting as well
1,first it is a very good movie
1,but it is also a very funny experience
1,this was a very bad film with no acting
1,in my humble life the film is a very moving portrayal of one of those characters that is in their essence
1,i was very impressed at the end of the movie
1,it has been so very hard since the beginning of a great career in the
1,society was a little more serious when we were young men who were
1,this is the worst piece in film history
1,the film also stars peter lorre in a very funny cameo and he delivers an excellent score
1,anyway the film 's premise has been given a little too much to be desired and to top
1,he is the only real person who is in the film as the main character
1,one day when he meets a group and his wife and sister they have to go to the
1,do not be fooled by it i
1,not much of a plot but a very good film with a decent
1,i think it should be a warning to me that this is not a film that is not so much as the other movies that
1,i 've seen some really bad films but this is the third one
1,i was very impressed when the movie ended
1,the film has a good cast and some very good special effects but i do not think that the movie is very realistic
1,the acting is pretty good and the acting by everyone is very good
1,oh and the fact it 's the most
1,the acting is terrible the story is boring the special fx are awful the
1,they did not know the names of this film in the movie
1,but the movie was so bad so
1,suicide is what it is like to see an episode that 's so bad it 's funny
1,the plot line is just too silly and the story line was so bad it 's good
1,this film is one of the best and it deserves it 's award
1,for those who do n't know what 's the story
1,there is some sort of suspense in it and the ending
1,haunted by the fact that the film is set in an era the characters and their motivations are n't even close
1,the script is so full of holes the acting the acting everything you could want from a video store that was a waste of time
1,but it 's just not worth seeing
1,he 's not a typical rapper but rather an antihero
1,it 's a very simple film that makes you laugh
1,it is an insult to the film that it should
1,the first half of it was a joke and a lot of the scenes were cut
1,generally this was an early talkie but it 's still a pretty decent movie
1,but if you do you 'll not have
1,in the first film the characters are a bunch of people
1,tv series is one of those shows where a group can be found and put in their work
1,it 's just plain stupid and not funny
1,i think that the actors are great and they are not
1,for a moment in the movie she is trying to be the next mistress
1,his father is a little bit of a loser but the story does make it seem real and believable for the whole family to be honest
1,the only saving grace is that the actors are good and there is a lot
1,this is one of those films that will make a great deal of money but it 's not that bad
1,acting is ok the plot is bad the acting is worse the script sucks
1,is the film an exercise in a plot or a film
1,one of those films where it was made for the sole studios of the 80 million dollar budget
1,as a movie it fails to deliver and as i
1,you know what you are in here and you will be disappointed
1,the film opens with a bang and the
1,one of these people has been in
1,like the other reviewers i have read the other reviewers here that the plot is so convoluted that it 's difficult for anyone to get it right
1,the only thing that really annoyed the hell out there
1,gabriel is the best character in this film and he plays a lot of
1,running away from a bunch in the middle i could have done much better
1,this is a movie that has nothing to do
1,donna and emma have to do this with
1,sean connery is perfect as the villain
1,but the fact that the main character and his wife had been played by the
1,i 've been a huge fan for several years now
1,marcus who has a son and sister has a secret admirer and son in the family 's home is a good one
1,as the film progresses the viewer gets to the story
1,in the end he has a heart of faith that has him to kill himself in a way that 's not
1,i would love the film and the director and cast to keep a strong eye out for such an exciting story
1,in addition the acting is superb
1,that 's the only way to get the dvd released
1,even though i was watching the whole movie in the theatre i
1,we do get a few moments from it
1,his performance is very good as well
1,even the title character has an affinity for him and the film itself is so bad it 's good i just wish he had done
1,it 's not a good story
1,and then there 's the acting
1,anyways there was one thing i thought i 'd be able to sit back and laugh through
1,uncle john was a very funny guy and i loved it a little too
1,i think it could easily go to a higher level of entertainment but the film has a very weak
1,more importantly this was the first time the producers tried to make this statement about a
1,like many of the other reviewers of this film i was very disappointed
1,i would n't say it was a good movie to begin the
1,i'm not one of those people who have never watched this film
1,this is the kind that makes the movie so memorable
1,i do n't know who this is the director 's intent to get the audience interested in watching the film
1,cinema is a bit slow and the movie 's direction and editing are terrible
1,shia labeouf was in this movie and i really liked the part where the guy was chasing a girl in a bar
1,do n't bother with it though the movie has
1,the film was n't bad it seemed almost completely lost
1,the script was so bad it made you laugh
1,hsiaohsien and company are very good at the craft but this movie has no meaning
1,santoshi is the best in the movie
1,a young girl is kidnapped in a hospital accident
1,this was not really the first movie of
1,if you can make you watch it for the sake that the characters do n't know that there has no one to root for
1,this movie does n't have a chance
1,you 'll have this kind time to get back to
1,i think the film is a bit like an extended version of it 's own
1,you will never know the difference
1,injun and jury is a movie that
1,to make matters even worse they just seem like they are trying something new and different and it does
1,i 've seen this movie several times since i 've seen and heard it in the same language and i
1,the acting is very good especially from the actors who plays the bad and the bad
1,his performance alone was so horrible
1,shortly after this film i was expecting a movie to have a few laughs
1,however i think the problem that is there is the way that it is presented as an afterthought
1,of course the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to the first
1,at times he is just plain annoying
1,ok it was great to see how a movie
1,i was very excited to see the movie in my own right
1,the movie itself is a good example to the director and the director of the film that they are trying to
1,in the end the movie is very well acted and the actors in this movie are a real pleasure to listen
1,this is a good film to watch for those with a sense that it was not a comedy but it is
1,the story is simple and the story is a bit of a stretch for the viewer to be drawn into
1,i'm a fan and i have a fondness to the film and i can assure
1,well it 's a bit of the same thing with the
1,but the film is also very well done in its own right it 's the best
1,for example i do believe that i did n't have a problem with this film so maybe i'm going to say it 's not a good
1,if this movie was a good movie to be a good thing then it might be
1,the plot is a bunch in the same way and that is where a movie that tries hard but fails miserably to impress and entertain the audience for an extended slow hour and an hour
1,the only reason i could watch this was that i did n't even bother seeing it
1,where 's it going from a scene where he says it sounds stupid
1,it 's a pretty good show that i have seen
1,even the title was pretty cool but not the best movie ever
1,plot twists are so predictable and the plot is ridiculous and the story itself is ridiculous and the story is very weak the acting is terrible the acting terrible the effects suck and even the worst is a poor attempt to be
1,palance was the perfect actor to play the character but he does
1,i'm sure that they are not all that great
1,or the other comments here have said the first time he is on a train he is n't really in any way
1,some people are n't talking about the plot and i do think that this is a good movie with a good plot that i did n't care
1,the film is a bit too long and a waste
1,it is a shame as to why they made this movie
1,the acting is pretty good but the story
1,in fact he is the one to watch and i would n't have given a better description about his character
1,watch them to find out what is going on and
1,some of my other favorite parts were when she said that she was in a
1,seeing the film at the end was very disappointing and
1,i have to say i did enjoy this film but it is not
1,they did not get the idea that the people who made this movie thought
1,the film does n't even come close to any other movie that it has in its time and a good cast
1,the acting is so good that the
1,charles durning is a very talented actor but the supporting players are all
1,when it was released it had been released on dvd
1,henry winkler is a great actress but i do n't know how he
1,is he the next step on the movie
1,the only redeeming factor was that it was n't a good one but not as bad as it could of it
1,and the ending is just as stupid
1,he is the only good actor in
1,the acting is n't bad either
1,i was very impressed by this one which has been done before by many others
1,it 's an insult that it 's not even that funny at times
1,eric stoltz as usual is the perfect combination
1,the film is a complete mess
1,like in many other commentators i was expecting a little too
1,it 's a shame it 's not available on dvd and the
1,this movie makes you want you to watch a lot of other shows like die hard
1,noth was a bit more than his typical hollywood and
1,the film was a little more ambitious and had some really funny scenes
1,they have a lot of fun to
1,counting is a great example of how a film is a good idea for a
1,what i do n't remember is why
1,this is a great movie to watch
1,at first i do n't get to see the movie
1,buckle and the others were a bit like the ones who were the main ones in
1,the acting ranges from being a bad
1,i am not a fan of films like these
1,given that it was not a bad movie it was a very enjoyable experience
1,but it 's just not a good movie
1,despite the obvious flaws of this film it is also very good for the viewer to
1,the acting was bad the plot line is worse the acting worse
1,geez the acting is terrible the plot and acting
1,there should be a movie about a movie that is
1,unfortunately there are some good scenes the first one and the first two
1,unfortunately i have a lot better things to say in this film
1,and what was up with that
1,is that the only one that has n't even made the point of this movie
1,his performance was not very convincing as the lead actor had a good time in
1,while this is a bit of an odd one at the time of its release it was also an interesting and enjoyable
1,people do this to me that is what the movie was made on the subject matter
1,the film is an utter failure
1,robert de niro as a doctor and a cop is a revelation to watch
1,in the end this movie is n't worth the time
1,the only saving graces are that the film lacks the
1,i was n't expecting the usual hollywood style to go for a movie like the exorcist but this was n't it
1,terror inc was a good movie to see in the first place but this movie is so awful
1,what 's so wrong with this film
1,if you 've ever read the above you 'll probably find yourself looking up the street
1,the plot was a bit predictable and the story was predictable but there is a story that has been
1,before the film 's release i can only imagine a few of the reviewers who have commented on this movie
1,the acting the writing and the writing is so bad that you have never seen a movie before you can forget how the story is about
1,i have to mention the ending
1,light hearted humor and a great script by tom
1,i was surprised when the plot was revealed
1,by far this film should be made
1,it has a great cast and the actors are all very good
1,the movie 's main theme is that the story has been changed by several very interesting people but they never seem to get anywhere near the
1,maybe this was the best film i 've seen in quite some time
1,okay it 's a good movie but it was n't enough for
1,i was a bit skeptical and bored to the
1,why did n't anyone like it
1,i do n't care when i see the movie on dvd so that you can watch it and i guarantee i 'll give it a chance
1,do they really need to do something that they should have never done before
1,when you see him in a movie like him you get the impression that it was a very low budget film but it 's still pretty entertaining and it 's pretty damn funny in parts and
1,what i liked about this movie was the fact that it took a long
1,it 's the only way i will remember it and i think the only way it should be
1,the story is a lot of fun
1,this is a good film for those of you that enjoy the movie
1,liev howard was great in a cameo role as a man who has never been able to find his way
1,olivier has been a great actor but the director
1,perhaps i missed something but that 's it
1,hell i am not the only one who knows where the movie is heading
1,if this movie does not get the votes you would think that you 'd have to pay money
1,and what a load for the most gifted filmmaker
1,in fact the film is n't even worth mentioning in any way
1,steinbeck 's film has been released in the us for many years and has remained in the
1,irene papas was a bit of the dancer
1,first of all this is a very weak film
1,in fact i was surprised to discover what a waste of time this was going
1,nicole kidman is the best actress on
1,she does not look like that she did not even have an affinity for it and the film was not so
1,not to mention there are moments where the main actor is
1,yes the plot is pretty basic but it
1,it 's also a movie that should make a lot better than the average sequel but the
1,some of the scenes are very funny and are quite
1,the story is a bit slow but is not enough to keep the viewer interested in
1,the acting was bad the dialogue is
1,three years later i 've been watching a show that has been told by some other actors and i do enjoy the film 's humor
1,ben chaplin is also in the film
1,a few years after the film reviewed was released on dvd
1,you can see the director 's intent to make a movie for the
1,but it is a good story to make for
1,the movie is a little slow moving but in the end it just
1,crocodile hunters is one thing i do n't like and i like the
1,but this is n't a movie that makes you wish to see more of him you wo never forget
1,apparently the film makers had been making a sequel to this movie
1,but the film is so good that you will find yourself laughing out
1,i would love it if i had
1,of the many of them it was a great
1,for me it 's all so obvious
1,first it 's just plain silly and stupid it 's a real stinker
1,i have no idea how it ended
1,it 's the kind of movie that you 'll love
1,as the title character suggests this one has to have been made and the movie is not for all tastes and it should n't be made to see a movie
1,looking at the film and the director 's comments i think i will have to read all the positive comments
1,it is the story that is so funny and the acting is excellent
1,it 's a shame to see such a talented cast
1,one can only hope for a future to come out of this movie
1,while it 's a true historical document it is a very interesting movie that is a true treat to any horror fan and if you enjoy watching this film you will
1,now that i am i just have a hard time adjusting it
1,the plot is a little weak
1,clint lupino is a delight in her performance as well
1,it was n't a good movie
1,the film has a very strong story that is a lot
1,i was very disappointed in this film and it was a bit more entertaining than that
1,the first one was good the acting is good but the script is so stupid that it 's so boring and boring
1,first of course the film does n't have the benefit to be
1,they are all the same but it 's still not a good
1,she is a very beautiful woman and a very beautiful girl
1,brings a couple to this one for the rest
1,the movie also contains a very interesting plot
1,it is an amazing story with excellent performances and a good story
1,thats why i did n't know how to write this film
1,i 've heard about the movie before
1,there are so few funny gags that you can see in your face and you have to keep up with it
1,i was hoping the film would get better
1,and that the only reason i gave up on it was due on my own the soundtrack
1,biographical was a very good show with a great deal
1,this movie is about a group in the country of switzerland
1,this movie is not a movie but a good movie for people who like the kind of movie
1,only the movie has a few redeeming quality to the film which is a shame
1,you 're not really sure what the real thing really was but i guess it was n't a good idea to make up for that
1,even the most ardent moviegoers could not find the original to be a very good film and it does n't have the same style as in the first one because the characters are very different
1,you will find yourself cheering for the characters and you have not seen
1,one of the worst movie i ever seen but this movie has nothing
1,he was n't so much in the same class as the first film
1,rockets and automobiles are the only thing they can do and are in this way
1,do n't bother your kids get it on your
1,the movie was a great success and i
1,which i think is supposed to show
1,another scene with the guy who was supposed to be the one with all of a half was a little
1,i was n't really sure if it would be a comedy
1,venturing from the past to the last
1,people who are n't familiar to the original movie will be
1,we are given some time of the story
1,please i do have a problem
1,whilst i was n't disappointed at how it was going i thought i had to give it some slack
1,i 've seen this movie several many years later and i was very pleasantly impressed
1,how many of you have seen this movie
1,then again i 'll give you a little bit of a good story to tell
1,further i think the film is more of the latter in my opinion
1,by now the director does a very nice thing for the viewer
1,certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
1,not only do you know that there was some sort in the world but
1,much better than the average hollywood movie
1,it is also a film that should be seen for the holidays
1,this is an extremely funny film with a lot to offer the characters are likable
1,here are some scenes that were not so much of a problem
1,to me that was a big surprise
1,unfortunately it 's not a good film
1,if you like to read a few good things about this movie it
1,these are the only people that can find this show funny
1,well it is not a good film
1,they should n't have made such a bad movie like this but the film 's producers
1,which is a pity because the film has a lot better to offer
1,carlos mencia does n't know what they 're doing but
1,i 've never seen a movie actively uttering the feeling of a film without having sex
1,i'm a big horror fan and the fact i saw it on a big screen i did n't know what to do with it and the story it was
1,in fact it would seem so stupid
1,few of them have to be the same one
1,almodovar is the best man in this film but he was the best actor in
1,that is the problem with this movie is
1,it was n't so much the case as it seemed to be an attempt at humor
1,i am a little biased about how it was filmed
1,there is a lot of things going on in the film which are n't even remotely amusing
1,she is the only person that makes you care what
1,about the only positive thing i have about this movie is that it was a
1,marcus is the only one in a long line of things to come up in a
1,very little is left to the viewer
1,i was a bit confused by the story the acting
1,ivan is a very talented actor but he is very good and the acting in it is superb and the
1,perhaps it 's not the fault of the filmmakers
1,recognition for some people who do so and so much for what it does
1,of all the other movies i ever watch this is a wonderful one and i think that i would rate
1,the first time it 's the same
1,i have to admit it is a very good movie
1,everyone has a chance in the movie
1,white is a film that is so bad that
1,i was so annoyed with that i had to sit at any time in the theater
1,n it is an amazing documentary and i would recommend it to people of
1,how does anyone find a werewolf 's hand or a body to the woman
1,outside of this movie the acting and direction of this movie is horrible
1,one of those films that you have been watching at least once a couple of times
1,a movie that i could watch it over 20 years
1,i think the movie was good enough for me and my fellow fans will definitely love this film
1,i would have preferred this film as being one that could have been made without a single word
1,id never thought i 'd ever heard of this movie
1,some scenes of the first film were pretty funny
1,as far as i can tell this is a good movie
1,sammy is also an excellent character and his performance is excellent as it turns out he 's a little stiff
1,two of the main actors in this film
1,could n't that be a more coherent
1,none the time is a great story line to
1,and the fact is that it 's just a
1,horrible movie about the mafia in the basement and the girl
1,i think it is a great movie and that 's all there was to it
1,magnolia is a must watch movie
1,story line is a lot more interesting as the story
1,i would love to see more of the work of a talented actor
1,while the story line is good and the acting in general is very bad and at the same
1,in this movie he does not seem to have a clue
1,anyway i have never been a fan
1,is that the best thing i have ever seen
1,this is the kind you 've ever been watching on the scifi
1,while this is not a great movie i think that it is one
1,if it were a comedy and the acting is good i 'll give you that 's right
1,and there 's a great deal more action
1,there 's not one redeeming feature to the film that has to do in a very bad way that it is n't
1,to me the only thing this film has going
1,clich is not a bad movie but it 's just bad it 's boring not funny
1,but this was the first of a long career and that is a shame
1,i am so glad that you can get to know
1,this is the only film worth mentioning that it is not a film for anyone
1,of course that is what makes this film good
1,at one time she is forced into a world of sexual harassment
1,too bad the film was n't that bad
1,i would love to see a movie with that in mind that i would have had a little bit of a good time watching this one
1,while it does a little bit of the time and the story is the
1,i was n't impressed with a movie i saw
1,i think it is worth a viewing of a film
1,beyond that i 'd be ashamed of the director
1,the only reason i even gave up on the movie was that the movie was pretty funny
1,the movie 's story is told through the eyes
1,elizabeth kidman has an outstanding turn as an actress who is a bit of a tomboy
1,i was n't impressed with it
1,we have the film and its message
1,however the director 's vision of a film like in the original film is a bit too short
1,taskin has to be one to avoid
1,i have n't been able at this site since i first read the book
1,i would n't call him a hero if i had known this
1,cut it out on the shelf and a movie
1,and that is the reason i did it to the end when i was n't a kid
1,the film is not for everyone it will make a difference in the life of all of these other people
1,beatty 's performance is also a joy to watch but i have no respect for the story
1,and if you 're in a coma you should see this movie as a child
1,nick stahl is a great actor but that 's not a good thing
1,anyway i 'll never forget it 's so bad
1,with a supposed expectation of the film 's plot i have to say there are many
1,this is not a film to be
1,from the very first moments of this flick the viewer feels that the film should be viewed as part
1,instead of being a big fat guy he 's just trying to be cool and ends up being a good
1,at the same time it 's a shame that it was n't canceled in the states for the
1,for all the other commenters this movie has an incredibly
1,in this movie we are left to ponder the difference of how it was going
1,some of my favorite actors include the great paul mccartney who is n't in the original movie
1,i would like the filmmakers to make
1,our protagonist and we 're told in flashback
1,blier 's movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves the genre or a film with a strong plot
1,after a while they are arrested for some unknown reason to get a little more money
1,i am not a big fan but the real
1,as for the plot it 's a bit of an excuse for a sequel
1,it also has a lot to live up to it and i was surprised that i got
1,rent it if it comes out on video
1,we 're in the middle east as the characters are not in danger but to us and
1,the film is a complete mess
1,i would recommend seeing it for the performance of john saxon for his acting ability in all the right reasons
1,the first time that he is the first film he is in
1,i am amazed it has been released theatrically
1,i was really shocked to see how a director could
1,the story is a little weak as the plot is
1,but the movie is a little long and i was bored with the ending
1,the only reason i watched this film was because of its flaws
1,character actor richard chamberlain was a very talented actor and was the only character who
1,the first time you see the movie you get to see some of these
1,there should be some more films made about this
1,right now there is a bit of humor that has to be seen to be believed
1,the first half is a little too talky but it 's not too bad
1,dunaway was the only reason i gave this movie a 4 instead
1,minghella also wrote a screenplay that had to be seen
1,every one of them was so stupid so the movie was a complete waste and then it went
1,so it is a movie that does n't seem to have the
1,we all know that we have no real experience
1,very similar to the movie the story the acting and acting was excellent
1,hopper has a good deal of humor
1,the acting was terrible the story is awful even for an independent film that was
1,he is not only the best actor in the entire career
1,okay the plot is pretty simple but the movie is
1,the movie 's premise is n't so simple that you can hardly understand why
1,although i do have the impression that the movie was made up to be one of these movies i think that it was a very
1,sadly the film is a total mess of a sequel
1,andersson is an expert who is a master of the art of storytelling and art
1,a few of the jokes are hilarious and
1,the acting was n't great but the characters were well developed the script was a great mix to show the characters
1,though i have to admit i did n't have anything else that could possibly be a good story
1,but the best part of the show has to be because the story of a young kid who
1,he 's not just a good actor but he is very convincing in a
1,among others it is n't a bad film
1,rambo is a great villain who is n't really a bad actor he 's an absolute hoot
1,this is not the worst movie ever it 's bad bad
1,we are shown the film in an interview of a young
1,in fact the film is a mess and a waste
1,but it was still pretty good with the two leads and the acting and the plot
1,this was the best of the series series
1,one of the most memorable and interesting stories of a life in the history of cinema in
1,it was a nice idea but it was n't
1,to me i would have made a better
1,richard gere is great as the conflicted and corrupt psychiatrist
1,sure there are no plot holes but it 's a great film
1,the acting was ok with a very nice twist and i was surprised by some of
1,having seen many films of this genre i have seen them and i 've seen them all
1,i 've read many other user comments on
1,the only thing i can say about this movie that i liked was how stupid it was in this film
1,the film was a bit of fun but i was expecting a lot from this movie
1,it does not have that much plot and is n't really about a group
1,my only gripe with this movie however was that the
1,absolutely awful movie with a capital c c g d
1,only a movie that i can watch with me
1,i do n't think the producers could be a bit more interested in exploring their ideas but the film itself is
1,some of the dialogue is so ridiculous that
1,jessica simpson 's character and her husband 's mother are
1,i do agree with the reviewer that this is a bad movie but not in the same league that this one
1,but that is n't saying it
1,what the heck is so wrong about this movie that 's all that is said in the first 15 minutes
1,vanessa redgrave was a great choice for this role as the woman
1,when i watched this movie my expectations for the first time was so i thought that this was one
1,furthermore the story is about as interesting a time as the
1,even the usually reliable david lynch is an interesting and likable character who is not only his most famous and most successful film actor but also the best
1,c thomas howell is a great character actor
1,im not saying this movie 's best to be that the best of them but this film has a lot of good action scenes that i have seen
1,it 's not even bad for the first 20 minutes or
1,the story is simple and there is n't any plot in this film
1,others have commented on this film
1,i would like it to be more of a classic film
1,i was n't expecting the usual slapstick jokes to be funny but the story was just a
1,tcm was a huge success of the first two
1,yes it 's a bit predictable
1,the film has a great deal to it but
1,both the director and the producer of photography
1,the film has a lot to be desired but i have n't found it to have been quite entertaining
1,nick nolte was perfect for this role as the lead detective and his character is also the only reason that he has made
1,i am sure that there 's more than one thing here in
1,into the movie we 're treated to a bunch of annoying characters
1,andrews plays a man with an attitude for the most part in her book and he 's given nothing else than a chance
1,but this is n't a good movie and it 's not the least
1,in fact the whole thing is not even funny or funny
1,but then we learn the basics of this story
1,some of them are just bad enough
1,too bad it 's not even the kind that the original
1,it 's a movie that has been done to
1,let it take the first movie to the end of a lifetime
1,she does n't want to be in any other situation
1,he was a very talented actor and was really good in this movie
1,also starring john cassavetes and john huston
1,on the whole it was just a poor attempt on recreating a story
1,the acting is very good with the whole crew is very nice but the script does n't make much sense and
1,i would not go into this movie expecting to see the worst movie of the
1,funny how much he 's trying to
1,but it 's just not as bad as the original the first
1,you 'll know it 's the only movie you will ever see in a theater
1,you 'll be glad you did n't pay to rent the dvd and you 'll be disappointed by this movie
1,as for the plot i have to wonder what a great movie was it was made for
1,i would n't even bother picking up the dvd
1,i think i will just say the whole thing is so
1,watch a couple minutes of it and you wo like the film and not have the same director and the actors
1,do not waste money with it
1,there were a number where the film is made
1,i 've seen it several many many times and will probably get a lot for it
1,the film has a great deal of humor and a nice atmosphere to it
1,or maybe it is because it is a
1,ok it does boast a few funny jokes
1,claire forlani is the only good part of her career
1,i am not a big movie fan
1,that is where the film begins
1,the movie is just another example of how people should feel and make
1,joyce is a great film maker and is the best one
1,there are many scenes where the camera is on screen and it is
1,stiggs is the worst movie i have had i walked out of my life
1,when they do n't get their hands on a large boat they decide to take a trip in a nearby
1,somehow they have the right to be the one that is the first to die
1,mgm 's first film is a wonderful
1,the plot is a little thin as is the acting
1,excellent movie about the power of the human spirit in
1,perhaps it was the editing and the direction
1,characters who are so unlikable and lovable are not even
1,jo 's character and his wife are both a bit different but their relationship is so much more than the characters they portray their own life and love and the love that develops between them
1,a lot more and this one really makes the film a bit confusing
1,shakespeare is not a good director for either
1,mendes also has a small role as a cop who is a little too reluctant to take his own life to the place of his life and he is a man
1,consequently i have never seen a movie with a budget that 's so bad
1,saif ali is great and this is one of his finest
1,how could you feel any sympathy for this movie as an example
1,if the film was to have some of the characters and the plot and plot development it would n't have gone over my head
1,me the same as i did n't like
1,in the meantime she gets to play a very good part of her life and makes you care about her
1,four years later he was born with his parents
1,the plot is simple enough to keep your interest
1,all of them are not even in the movie for the first
1,our 'hero' is a great actor and a good actor
1,inbetween the movie is a movie that should be avoided by everyone
1,still the script was n't very bad
1,portia and her friend have to decide which of the men they were
1,this is the kind that i have to endure
1,almost every scene is the best and most important to me is in the film
1,also the fact that the movie is based on actual facts that is not
1,it 's a good story and the characters are believable the characters in the
1,if you have a choice for a movie you 're in for more fun
1,i was so disappointed by it
1,i think the director did something with the production of the script and the direction was good
1,the acting is superb and this is one of the
1,he has to go back to her home to save a friend
1,even the actors are all excellent especially elisha cuthbert as the evil witch
1,i'm sorry but i would like a lot of the story
1,he had the potential but he 's not a good person
1,possession of the beast and the snowman are not all that
1,what 's with all the other people
1,i would n't be able to sit through the whole thing
1,then he finds a man and her father
1,you have to watch it for yourself
1,maggie smith was great as the lead character
1,so if there were any complaints about the movie the characters were not that stupid the whole movie was just boring and unnecessary
1,the only good point of the whole thing
1,it 's not so bad as the movie
1,and the ending in the end was quite
1,of course there were some good points to be found in the story
1,roberto moreland is a fine filmmaker
1,also in this scene were the ones
1,lord of the board is an extremely bad movie that
1,del jovi 's performance was a little too bad but
1,my favorite scene was when we watch it on tv
1,it is very sad that the filmmakers were able to make a good movie
1,i think the film is a great film for the ages
1,in the end the movie ends up becoming too predictable and too melodramatic but i really liked it
1,the first time i ever saw this movie was in it 's entirety of a movie and a lot of it
1,the plot is a bunch that the filmmakers could have written
1,something that happened to me in the beginning of the film is that the film makers are not going to take care of the characters as well
1,nonetheless it 's a pretty decent show
1,it also does make you wonder why the characters have to die in a very strange way
1,i was expecting something like that to happen
1,more importantly it does n't even matter
1,a few years later he 's been a cop and now he 's been a member for a year
1,as for the movie itself it is
1,it is a very interesting and enjoyable movie but it is n't
1,is the fact that there are so
1,you can read the book and do it
1,that was the only way i could get through this film
1,the story was pretty weak and was the most ridiculous part of the entire movie but the ending is a bit too predictable and
1,and the movie was so stupid in my opinion
1,they should have stayed at home
1,this movie is an excellent example
1,as with the previous reviewer this movie is not the worst movie of the last couple of films
1,i 've seen this film countless times already and it 's one of its most enjoyable moments
1,e a movie about a serial killer who tries to make the movie more like a comedy or a drama
1,also i thought he would be a bit more interesting
1,what was the deal about this film
1,even if there were a couple of decent action scenes this film might have been made better by the fact it 's a remake of the original
1,not that it 's bad or it 's just bad but not that bad either as well
1,asoka does not come across as a good guy but he is a good actor
1,it 's all so bad you could tell the whole point in the movie was to make a better film for a few hours
1,the film has the worst acting i ever saw
1,i have never seen a movie that i have n't seen before and that is why the film was
1,alan rickman plays the part with an intensity
1,how about a movie that is not a horror movie or even a good horror
1,the plot is not even that much
1,perhaps they should have been a little longer but they were not as bad as
1,yeah you do not know why i think this
1,the only reason that i could watch it was because my friend and i were laughing hysterically in it 's badness
1,she was the best actress of this movie
1,lance henriksen is excellent in the role and he is the only reason why the movie
1,for a long while i was expecting a bit of this
1,after seeing this movie i realized how this movie had been made
1,a good cast and a great supporting actress
1,because of it 's a very funny story
1,i have never seen this movie before and i have a hard to tell the story was a
1,as with all of the comments i have read here that he 's a good actor
1,this has a great cast including the likes
1,the movie is about a young girl in a mental institution in a country
1,those were not enough to make a movie
1,by the end of the movie i was left
1,i have not laughed so hard that when i first saw the movie i
1,there are so many good parts in this that i have watched and enjoyed this one so much
1,if you 're not familiar with the story and characters of the first season you should see this one
1,the film is an utter waste as a movie but it is still a good movie
1,gosh i know it 's not a
1,of note it was a movie
1,also the movie is n't a bad one
1,if i did i would n't have to go to sleep
1,just a couple of things that make this a fun movie
1,once again this movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,so if your not looking for it to have a little of an interesting plot it is the story
1,at first i did n't think the movie is going to be a good one
1,i'm sure it was n't the first thing to do in hollywood
1,it 's a pretty bad idea but it 's not enough to
1,it 's a great movie for anyone who likes
1,then the whole thing collapses into one
1,i was n't expecting a lot more from it but
1,in this film the actors are n't even in the movie for
1,and if you are a true fan of hers 's work then this is the film for me
1,certainly this movie was made for kids that are not a fan of the genre but
1,i was so excited when i found that the movie was about four quarters long
1,apart from that this movie does not have that much depth to his
1,davis was one of my favorites and i had a great laugh at her
1,thought that the movie would be a little better than the first one
1,not to have a clue what it should really be
1,dear readers do n't have a clue of what i like and what
1,well the real story is n't all that good
1,this is a good example for the whole movie
1,all in to the paradiso that is n't the case
1,but it has all the ingredients to be a good movie and i recommend it as a comedy to me
1,do we really want to know why he 's so obsessed about her work
1,this time around and the two boys are married and married the other two men who live in paris and the two meet in the woods but their marriage develops
1,telling a tale of a boy with a
1,secondly the acting is so bad that the plot lines and
1,i have seen it several more times
1,that said that the film is a complete
1,this is a very interesting documentary of a time and
1,this is an excellent film about a young couple who go through a divorce to their family
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,the first time i saw this i was very impressed
1,sincerity is n't necessarily a bad sign
1,at the same moment i was thinking that the actors were all excellent and they did not know each actor and were very funny and very good at
1,and i really do n't know where it was going and i did like the ending
1,besides a very bad acting job by john goodman the film 's only redeeming factor is a lot more
1,it 's a great movie but it 's just plain bad that you could n't get a chance to sit through
1,it 's a shame to say this but that 's a shame
1,an excellent film that is worth a watch
1,rpgs is a very good film about life in the early years of war and
1,meanwhile we are left wondering why the director chose such
1,he does it to his advantage that he is a little too old for the part of a man
1,the film is a very interesting and compelling experience
1,i 've seen many many movies in my
1,dorothy lamour plays the young daughter who 's always been a woman
1,when i was on my laptop he was n't even remotely close enough
1,in this one the film is a very funny movie
1,i 've seen this movie a few times and i think its great
1,she is an excellent actress but she does not seem very convincing in this film at all
1,so it is a great movie
1,i was a fan in this series
1,yet it 's the best of its
1,he is a man with a conscience but not an assassin
1,shoot it up and go see it with the help of the great elisha cuthbert as the
1,this is a good movie and a good one
1,i saw this movie on hbo yesterday
1,mutated and lifeless the acting was terrible and the plot
1,they should n't be ashamed that they are not
1,i'm not sure what it is supposed but i was so surprised by it i was n't really expecting anything from it
1,overall i would give it 7 and i will give it 1 out
1,this movie is a very funny and touching film about the life that was in the world when the movie is about the family
1,this film is an insult for anyone who wants a film that does
1,the story of the story of the famous american family in the first place and the second half of the film is a bit too predictable and a few of the
1,how does she get a divorce in the first 10 minutes
1,the only problem in me is the way the characters were portrayed in a very interesting story
1,while the film is about a woman and the boy she loves her mother
1,farley and his friend and the rest are just as good in the lead as the main character 's own
1,the movie has an excellent plot but the story is just awful with an annoying ending
1,they are both the only ones i know and they 're in the right
1,kids will not find this offensive as well as the other two
1,in fact the whole film has a great soundtrack
1,the script is so poor it 's laughable
1,the film also has a very interesting theme song
1,john cusak and his partner is the main character who is in the film 's most memorable moments
1,the only redeeming feature of this mess is that it is a movie for all ages
1,and there was the fact that a movie is a comedy
1,it is the first movie in which this is a true story
1,so i was looking up to a movie and a good laugh
1,this is a movie of many different people 's lives
1,anderton is the ultimate leader of the group he
1,it is a movie about the human spirit
1,would you believe it was n't a
1,the story is n't that good but it 's not enough good
1,he is a great artist of the time
1,lady snowblood is a film with all the clichs and turns it into something
1,he also meets one woman and she 's just as bad as it was then to me that he has been in this movie
1,it was just so stupid and so stupid that i could n't help i think the director did this with a bunch
1,some of these scenes are very well done and it does n't
1,a movie that makes a good statement about how the movie should be in my book
1,life is a real shame to see a film with such low budgets
1,blind man 's name is a bit of a rip on the head
1,why the hell did the writers bother putting
1,when i saw this movie on the sundance channel this week it seemed like a very bad film
1,the acting was so bad that it was just plain funny
1,this is not one of them and i would not
1,i'm sorry for the poor girl to watch this crap because she does n't care about the character but it 's not
1,for the first time in time i thought that was the best part
1,the movie is so slow and so poorly acted the acting is so poor
1,the story is very interesting and the ending
1,the film does n't seem to go into all that
1,and if i had the privilege of watching something else i could have a clearer
1,having been a fan in my life i 've never seen a movie that has
1,it is a pity that the movie has n't got a wider
1,alison kudrow is great as always
1,if the movie had been made to a little known in a time capsule it would be much better with its characters and the way it 's edited to be
1,if you do not have the opportunity to watch this movie you are a
1,look for the cast and crew
1,first off let us know what the hell is the story
1,well the film itself is n't as bad as i 've seen
1,as far from as possible i am not a christian fan of this
1,i have seen many of the other reviewers who say that the show was so bad
1,i'm still a fan of the book but i have to say the movie was not
1,i was surprised that it got canceled
1,never have you seen a film that has been
1,in fact i was a bit surprised when i saw the first
1,maybe it 's all about it
1,the only reason that the movie 's success is the acting and acting
1,this one is a real stinker
1,it 's a real stinker of a movie
1,wyman does have a strong sense that the woman of her husband was n't really trying to be her father
1,his performance is n't very convincing
1,this movie is about a young man named sasha
1,hint of being a little bit more than a typical hollywood
1,from a very point this movie does not have a single scene that does not seem like an
1,wow i 've been a fan for my family
1,trying desperately hard to be a little bit scary i could go wrong
1,only one good scene is that it 's a good movie but the story line
1,not much of a fan base in the first film
1,his performance in the film is not a bit overthetop
1,the film 's only flaw lies with
1,as a film maker it is a very moving story
1,the plot is simple and interesting and the actors are all excellent
1,i'm surprised that it 's not a total loss
1,some of the other reviews seem very harsh
1,i 've always thought that the best performance is the actor playing
1,they are all very interesting in their own way
1,while the film 's plot is n't as bad as some of the reviewers it 's pretty much
1,directed by david cronenberg and written by a very gifted director
1,this film is a must for all ages
1,i am a fan of the original movies and i really liked the movie
1,for a film that features some very good songs it 's the story that is told by the director
1,blade li 's character is a complete wimp
1,he is also a master in his life
1,by far my favorite movie of my life i have ever watched
1,imagine if you 're a fan of bad cinema or the movies with
1,kiera knightley is a very beautiful actress in every scene
1,jones and her are all excellent together
1,backdrops like these were good and the acting in the lead was very solid especially from a
1,the film is about an ordinary woman named lena who is a little
1,a film about the life that is supposed to go on in life in a way and a story about the struggle between the two brothers is a bit
1,he was the perfect choice for the show though but the script was a complete joke
1,timon of hazzard has no redeeming quality and is a very poor imitation of the original the original
1,strangely enough he does n't have to worry
1,the acting is pretty good with an excellent performance by the leads
1,if you are an american and i know a lot from the us i would recommend it to you
1,the story is about love love and betrayal in this world war ii
1,the acting by the actors was horrible
1,very funny and well done but it
1,but it 's a good film
1,cary grant is the only one that i can remember who
1,the acting is n't great but the acting is superb with the cast of the film
1,i 've heard about the director 's commentary and it 's so hard for me
1,finally he has the courage and attention of the other members of the expedition
1,so i was really surprised to finally watch it
1,this movie was so horrible i just did not get bored
1,though this has a very low rating and has a low budget i still do
1,gary busey is one that can be watched by the kids in
1,this is the best of all the movies that i
1,i 've been looking forward for some of the movies to get a hold of my
1,the plot is very interesting and the
1,victor pesci and his team of friends are
1,i saw a lot on my local video recorder and was looking forward to seeing it
1,its not as bad as i 've seen but it 's still a
1,i was a bit confused when the movie finally ended
1,i am glad i saw the movie
1,then he is able for the most part of the film that is n't the least important element of the whole
1,i 've seen better acting in porno
1,the plot is n't too good but the story and characters do nothing
1,the script is a bit slow but it 's not that bad either
1,altogether i found some scenes of the film and the actors of this movie were very good
1,the plot is very simple a woman who lives a life with a
1,it seems like a bad acid trip
1,the film is a complete failure
1,he 's also in the movie too and the
1,this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes comedy or a good family flick but i am glad i was able to find it in the local video shop i did not
1,the film is set up by the end and the viewer is left to wonder why this was ever released
1,it was a very interesting movie that made you want it
1,i have seen better acting and cinematography
1,yes there are a lot of movies like that where i have to
1,well the plot is very simple and the characters were very believable
1,i was so bored that the movie is a total mess of a movie
1,sadly the script has been written by a bunch of
1,i'm not a big fat fan of this movie but it 's the first of them to die the last days
1,to be sure i have to admit that i did n't have any expectations
1,many of you have n't seen this one in a theater
1,the plot and the story are n't the best
1,it 's all in all a good movie if your
1,but if the movie had a chance at least to
1,if you have a craving it is a movie about a young man who is a little more disturbed
1,i am sure that the movie is a good example but i doubt it
1,as a longtime lover i have to admit i was surprised that this movie was released theatrically
1,as it turns in a film that has a certain charm of a genre that 's a big success
1,we see the movie in a way that i do n't want to miss anything but that is not the case in
1,aside from that the film is a mess of a film
1,the only reason to make this film is because of the fact it is a
1,one is an ardent fan who can only get a glimpse in the face of the film and
1,he does n't have a clue he has been sent by his father for a while
1,at first i did n't understand how he got a
1,this movie was so terrible it actually
1,he had the ability of a very powerful and very very long and loving story
1,unfortunately the script does seem to have a lot to offer the viewer with a lot of the story that 's
1,better than the other ones that i 've seen in
1,there is no doubt that the director is not going to be a fan of the original
1,and if the film was n't that funny it should have been a hit
1,it 's a pity that the film never had a chance to make a sequel
1,the film also does not have that much time and it is about as far from being able to cope with issues that
1,i think the film is very funny to me
1,but i did n't care for the characters and they were n't even mentioned
1,it 's a shame because the film has the feel that
1,respectful and very dangerous in terms of the film 's subject it is not very convincing
1,as a result of the fact that this was made as a
1,i'm a fan and i was a huge child fan
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,dialog is just a little too old for
1,all in all i 'd like a few more of the actors to see the
1,overall a good movie that you can find yourself watching
1,the only good part of the movie is the fact
1,the story was a bit farfetched but the characters were believable the story was great the acting was
1,in my opinion it is a very poor
1,in this case it 's a very nice film
1,in the meantime there 's a reason for that
1,in one of her best movies you get the feeling that her acting abilities were
1,why the two men would n't be the same
1,he is a little over the head with a few
1,critics do n't know how to write something about the film
1,the movie was a complete success
1,i was really looking for it for the first 15 minutes
1,after a while the film ends abruptly with a bang at one another 's head
1,is a great film for all the reasons that it is a classic _EOS
1,simply put this one is n't a complete waste of time
1,europa is a very dark and depressing film that is so well acted
1,i was very surprised when i first watched this
1,most of the actors were very funny
1,the film was also a very good one which was a little too good for me
1,at one particular event in the world the audience is left asking what to
1,this film has the same effect as the original and i think its
1,and the fact that it is so bad that
1,this movie was so good it had to be one of those movies that had a good deal of good acting
1,let the story unfold in the end it 's all just a waste for the viewer 's sake
1,so i can see why the movie was n't released theatrically
1,the movie is not even close enough in its entirety but the film is not as good and as it seems in the end it is n't
1,i think the director is trying too much
1,also a very funny scene where the father of the family is a bit too reluctant
1,the first time i saw this i was in tears that was it was n't a complete waste of the film
1,the film also contains a lot of sex and sex scenes including the main character 's sexual conquests in his
1,still a few years ago we were
1,that was one good part of this
1,apart from the fact it 's not a bad idea
1,robert deniro and the rest of his cast are pretty good
1,and i do not think that this show was a success or an
1,some of this movie 's success and so much fun as to make one
1,its a shame because it 's not even a movie for everyone who
1,and the whole movie is not very interesting to watch in a movie
1,but the movie is about a guy trying hard to be a little too hard and it 's really really bad and boring at times but the rest of this movie just is n't
1,they 're a lot of fun to watch
1,the film is a complete mess with an excellent cast
1,it was n't the same thing
1,each time a movie is released it does not seem to work
1,definitely the film 's most memorable moments are when it is presented by a great cast and the performances are all excellent and well suited for the film 's cast
1,lord of dracula is the first feature film in the trilogy of films and is quite a treat for fans that will be disappointed but the film
1,overall the movie is a good movie but not a great one at that
1,moonwalker is a very good story and the actors play the part of each character
1,hopefully the producers had the intention of
1,i think that 's why the movie works so much and the acting is great the script is good the music is fantastic and the music is beautiful
1,johnny depp is the perfect person but he 's a little more believable and the
1,i have a lot against this series as it is not a remake of
1,the script does provide a unique glimpse into life and death at the hands but ultimately
1,for me it 's not a total loss
1,for the first half hour a half hour or so of the film it was a very dull film with a few
1,i do n't know what to say
1,too many of them are so awful so poorly acted they ca only make a point about it 's existence
1,it 's also a very funny movie
1,with the help of a young boy he is forced into the case
1,the script was good enough but the story
1,ariel 's mother is a very rich young woman who was abused by her husband and her lover
1,like all of us who have never heard of
1,there 's a scene in which the guy is trying at the door and a woman 's face goes on and on
1,you do n't see anything like this in your life
1,in fact there are moments that are just stupid
1,i think it is a movie to avoid
1,happily i think it 's a film about
1,eddie has a nice time in the end and it 's a very clever way to spend an hour
1,these scenes were the most memorable aspect of the film and was well worth seeing
1,it is n't a movie that will leave you wondering whats going on
1,it 's a shame because it 's not even close to being scary and the acting of everyone 's favourite actors is so
1,he 's an idiot in a hospital in his country
1,the plot was interesting as it went on and the film was a little too long
1,it has been done before and done so
1,to be frank it has the feel and the story is so real and the
1,of course that 's not all that really happened to me but i do admire this movie
1,and i 've seen a number of movies that seem to be
1,at first i thought it looked like something like the movie was a lot better
1,it has been said that the movie was n't a complete waste for one of the most controversial characters i 've had the fortune
1,i have n't been a big fan but that was probably the reason
1,it 's not a comedy to begin by having one of the actors
1,and then there 's the scene of a young woman who
1,cheap and lifeless but it 's a fun movie with a decent cast and a very entertaining cast
1,i would like to point to the casting of the director and
1,i do n't even remember any farting scene when i saw the entire film in a theater
1,now i do know why it is the only movie
1,all in all it 's pretty bad
1,if i could have the director 's opinion of the film i could n't
1,robinson and his men are in a different location with the usual western and it 's easy
1,we are also treated to a few interesting scenes in the end but there was no suspense in the movie as there was
1,the film is a very moving one with some good acting and the story lines are quite compelling and the story
1,in the case of the movie the
1,he 's just the kind of person who loves his character and is n't just as much as the other guy that has been around for years
1,you 'll get to see this movie
1,set to a very good end
1,i was surprised to see that it is a good film
1,as i said above it is still pretty bad
1,the only reason this movie is so successful
1,view the movie for its own good and the good old fashioned and bad
1,i do n't think anyone else is going to make such a bad movie
1,and that is all i can say about it
1,the film 's only flaw of all is that it is not even so much a little bit of an
1,eventually the film goes down hill and then begins it 's not as if it would have been made for the film to make for some interesting
1,i 've seen this movie several times and never get bored
1,not only do i love this movie so i 'll never see it
1,a few scenes and the other one is n't a lot
1,the script was written from a screenplay by an
1,also a few words of text is not a movie for all of its detractors but if you 're not a horror movie fan and you 're looking at a film that is supposed to be a
1,is it a comedy a comedy
1,champlain 's role was also pretty good but i do n't think that
1,the film has an allstar actor who is in a very small supporting roles
1,it 's like an insult to the audience who are trying to do something different and different
1,i was surprised by the fact that the film was not the best film of all time
1,you do n't have the money that you 're going through
1,he has the ability and his wife who is a
1,while watching the movie i felt that i was watching a documentary on which the film is based
1,faced with the fact that the story is n't about the family they are not really a good idea to be done
1,i 've never been a big big fan or anything ever made movies
1,this movie is a total disaster
1,in fact the movie is so poorly done it makes a mockery
1,we are shown to be a great fan of a very good show that we have not seen so many times
1,the movie 's title is an indication of
1,evan willis is a good choice for rathbone and the supporting cast is fine
1,moments of this movie are the worst acting ever and the worst movie i have ever seen and i do n't think it is worse than the original and a complete
1,but it 's also pretty good
1,he is a man who 's trying to protect himself with some kind of a bad man
1,the plot was simple enough to keep my interest but the characters
1,it 's not a good film and is
1,but if you do n't want them i
1,the story is simple in fact and is n't a very
1,if you have n't read this movie you will find yourself thinking
1,hey the movie is not that great
1,it is a film that can make people want them to
1,the story of an aging boy who is sent back into the world of the death is a very interesting one and a little bit of a stretch of the film but the story has its flaws
1,here 's a hint at the end
1,the movie does have a very good plot and i really enjoyed it
1,anne is an actress who 's not a very good actress but a very good one
1,he 's not even a good looking guy
1,it 's a pretty good idea
1,matthew lillard is a fine actor he does a decent turn in his performance
1,it is not the first thing i have to say to the film but this is my favourite film
1,well i do n't have to go to the movies to see how this movie could have ended
1,all the actors are all fine and the movie is a good example for a low quality production
1,then again there is an element that is the only thing that makes sense
1,if you want to see the original movie of what the future can accomplish the original series will be
1,there were also some interesting elements of this film
1,i think it 's the greatest movie ever made
1,i 've seen a lot more than this movie and i have to admit that i did n't have a problem with the movie
1,job of a movie should n't go anywhere else
1,the film is also a good movie to watch
1,after that they 're the only characters who could possibly survive the fact he 's so damn bad
1,the first one was the best
1,ever since i saw this movie i was impressed
1,what is this supposed to have been
1,for those who like the first movie this is the
1,risking the movie for being a classic comedy with a very strong storyline it
1,it was n't even so bad it could have made a difference
1,not that this was a bad thing
1,one of the few movies where they try hard to be a horror flick but it 's a
1,a few scenes are pretty good and i
1,a very nice film with a great plot
1,philippe is not a great character
1,that was n't a lot of this movie
1,then the story goes into the story line
1,most importantly the scene of the film
1,worst movie you 've seen since your
1,the movie also has some of its own moments
1,when he arrives the next scene comes into a scene where she is forced to leave him
1,of that the movie 's main character 's
1,i would like to see this series in
1,a young lady who has a secret crisis in her apartment has been
1,also the ending is the best
1,there is a lot going on about the whole thing
1,but this one does n't have a single redeeming feature to it and it just did n't deliver in me
1,a great example of a good movie is the fact it is a movie that is just about as funny as the rest of it
1,this movie is a masterpiece of a film and the acting
1,the story is about as good as it gets and
1,i would recommend this movie to any fan of the genre
1,but it 's not even worth mentioning how this man could have
1,it is very difficult to suspend the disbelief to see
1,but the movie itself is a very good movie
1,with the exception of the first film i was very wrong about seeing the movie as the movie
1,later there 's some really stupid character interaction between the two
1,the movie is a bit boring for
1,as a movie it 's a little too long in places that
1,and i was impressed by the story
1,there are some good performances and the film does a fine work at
1,the plot was a little confusing and the acting is terrible but that it is
1,amazingly he 's a very funny movie
1,the story has a lot more to do with the movie than the plot itself and there is a very weak ending which is a bit confusing but i found the film quite engaging
1,kusturica 's direction was also very poor and was not a very good choice to put it
1,they have to make movies and they do so in order you
1,this is a really great story
1,if they had the money to do something else it might be a little unfair
1,i think that 's what i got from the story and characters that were so well written and directed so beautifully that the viewer would care about the characters
1,it 's a good story but there 's not enough material for the
1,you have to watch this movie to find it
1,their acting is great and it is not
1,it 's not the best movie i 've ever watched but it is one of those movies that i really do n't understand and is a must see
1,but then again that makes the show more interesting
1,but the film was a total mess as well and it is a very good movie with great acting and a very strong script
1,i have seen it several times over time
1,this is a movie for everyone that is interested into their own lives or just enjoy the music and love
1,herein that the producers were obviously making fun of it all but they should be able to do that
1,hidden frontier has a very strong story which is not
1,so it 's a shame that the film is not a remake or a sequel but it is definitely worth watching
1,pacino plays a young woman who is attracted to
1,maybe it 's because i'm a bit
1,an interesting premise is that the filmmakers were so enamored that the audience could n't care less about them and the plot was n't really that easy
1,i was very surprised by how it was in a movie and in the first movie
1,aside from that the movie is a complete waste on the big budget
1,spoiler alert i think that if you do n't know it in the first few episodes of you 'll like it it 's not
1,the plot was a little rushed and the ending seemed
1,to me this was the worst movie ever made in this case i do
1,i would have thought it would have been better if the actors had a better
1,finally it 's just a great job for an old classic and that was the only one i liked
1,gone is the story of a family man who is kidnapped by a young man and has a child who is also a very nice guy and his son 's father
1,hepburn is a wonderful actress and is very good as the lead character who is also
1,armstrong 's performance was a bit stiff and the film did n't work
1,she was n't the only person who seemed to have a lot to do
1,one thing i do n't have about the whole movie
1,and that 's where the film is in the end and the movie
1,as it turns in it 's a very funny thing
1,the only reason i watched them in was the fact that i
1,the first is the music of this show and the music and the songs
1,for the most diehard viewer of the series i have read all of the books and i have read other reviews on the movie
1,unfortunately the film never stops and the plot twists and plot holes were completely unbelievable
1,ok maybe i just saw the film and it was a complete disappointment but this is a
1,carol danes is also very beautiful and her character was so believable that she could play a woman and a woman
1,the story is a little convoluted and is n't really a good thing as it lacks the
1,like all of the other films i have seen this is the one in which a character is introduced to a different actor who is so annoying that i ca least recommend this film
1,i do not know why but it is a very good film and i would recommend this movie for anyone reading the book
1,one wonders about the movie 's existence is the story
1,poste the director has a nice touch of style and a good sense
1,it 's a shame that the film never gets
1,you can tell they should have had a bigger budget and a better script
1,when she is not a woman who wants to get her out there she decides to go
1,it 's a movie that is so good
1,in a nutshell this was a film that i did n't like
1,randolph scott is the most underrated actor
1,ian mcshane has a small part but i think he was just as good and a little bit of a jerk as the character
1,and if this does not make the story a little more interesting it is
1,imagine what to expect a lot less of the
1,sasori is a good character actor in a film which does a good
1,the script was n't too bad but there was a lot going
1,it 's a good show and it 's very entertaining to watch and a bit scary but it was fun and well worth watching for
1,people who like it will be disappointed
1,this one was the first one
1,the acting is terrible and it has some of the best special effects of all times
1,he has a knack at finding out that the real world was not
1,but if it does n't get any better i would have
1,have you ever heard the title character or the book or even read
1,as with all the other user 's movies i had seen this movie
1,kate beckinsale as a mother who has to face
1,but this is the only one i 've ever walked out
1,in fact i think the reason i liked it so much is that he has a
1,overall an enjoyable and very entertaining movie about how a young young man 's career is in the world
1,the only thing i have ever heard that 's not funny the whole film was so boring that they actually tried to make something out
1,it 's not as funny as the
1,and the ending of the movie is so predictable
1,no one should have known that the movie was made
1,we are supposed to sympathize on the characters and we do not care about them
1,but if it 's not bad enough the story is n't a complete mess
1,i was so shocked by the way i got
1,i was very disappointed in this movie
1,even with a better story the characters are still very good
1,the story is about a boy who kills the young
1,so if this movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever it 's still not a bad movie and should be avoided as the worst i ever saw
1,the film starts out as the first movie of the movie the only other two are the first two films of
1,it is an excellent film and one who has never known that this movie was filmed in the first movie
1,it 's not all that funny it was a complete failure
1,the acting was n't too good either and the acting
1,it is a pity as to why a lot more than the film is rated r
1,they are just a bunch that 's the best and most of them
1,preferably the same thing that happened in the movie i did not like it at
1,it 's all the more intriguing and i think
