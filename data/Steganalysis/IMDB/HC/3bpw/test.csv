0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,as far a horror flick this has to be a classic for its time
1,another great movie from a director who is in the right place as a writer is a genius
1,did they get it right there in the movie
1,but this one is definitely worth seeing and for the whole purpose of
1,bunuel 's film was so much better and i was surprised that the director and writer had
1,i do recommend seeing the movie and it is not even
1,hazel munro is good as her mum who is also
1,perhaps the best of it is the way it shows how a character has fallen in the foreground
1,maybe if he is in his thirties i doubt you 'll be disappointed but he has a very good script
1,this film was made in the us and the film is very well made
1,a great film about a man whose wife and child were a
1,an american werewolf who is n't even bothering to accept his name is a vampire
1,this was a very good show
1,i do believe it was an attempt to show the audience
1,as for it it was an enjoyable film
1,unless it 's the kind of movie that makes you want you to laugh at something you do not want to miss a chance that this movie is going to
1,immediately the two men come together and the men are killed at the hands of a local politician in the form
1,there was a very good scene in the movie when it was a movie that had a good cast and i really wanted a refund
1,by all the other reviews i 've heard that the movie is not worth the time
1,although some might say it was a good movie i found it to really have a lot of laughs
1,i think that it would have been a good movie if it
1,now this was one of the most popular tv series i 'd ever see and it is n't a show that i
1,the plot of the movie is a bit contrived and the plot line was n't even worth mentioning in any way
1,to me the acting and acting is very bad
1,this film does n't even seem like it 's a good idea to go to the bathroom where they are going
1,i 've watched a movie that is so good and so
1,the film has an interesting message
1,we have the usual american cop who has no redeeming features in the movie and
1,but the real thing here is that the
1,the film is an interesting film
1,the plot is simple the acting was horrible the plot nonexistent so the special
1,so i guess i have n't seen this
1,but then again there 's another thing
1,this movie has a lot more going it 's a good one
1,i do not want to talk too much at all about this story
1,this movie has a lot to recommend
1,now we are treated a bit of violence
1,from that moment on i was so relieved to hear the name of one actor and the film was released
1,catch up with his friends the other way round and then they all get killed
1,in my book the most memorable scene in the entire movie is when the killer 's wife is kidnapped
1,this was a great show with an amazing plot
1,i have seen this film countless many years ago in a theater with its approximate cast and a story
1,i was so excited when this movie came to my tv
1,the only thing that i found was the fact that a few of my
1,i would like to say that this movie is not a total waste of time
1,i was surprised to see that it was released on dvd and that is what i saw
1,the story and acting are very good and it 's easy to find the actors who
1,even in the final moments of the show there 's a lot that 's just
1,he does not know what the truth is
1,the story is simple and the characters do n't even have the benefit of a decent movie that
1,the plot is pretty much the same as a lot but
1,or even if this film is a good one it does n't deserve to have it 's fair
1,the movie does n't make sense at all it 's just about as good as watching paint dry
1,a movie is a lot more of a
1,i was expecting the usual clichs that are supposed so i can forgive them for having to endure a movie that i have never read
1,well it 's the best of all the columbo
1,the only good thing that i can say is this film was
1,there 's a lot going on at once the film is too serious to be a serious drama with the
1,as a result of this i could not have cared what happened to her daughter in the end
1,this was the first movie of a great series
1,scalise has a son who 's been kidnapped by her father and his
1,it 's a movie about a young girl who marries a girl
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't released on dvd in the us
1,since then and the movie is over the head the story is just boring
1,assume they are making a good movie
1,a young girl who has been married to a younger woman
1,i was n't expecting the film to be a comedy but i found a lot and i thought the
1,either the director or the director did n't want to give us the impression that we
1,a good story and good acting by all involved especially with the leads and a great cast of characters
1,the acting by the actors is terrible the script and dialogue are awful and the plot is
1,christopher lloyd is in the movie for a good laugh
1,the only way i can recall this is when i see a tv show that i was in and the whole family was laughing so hard that it made my heart hurt and
1,for example the two main characters were all in the film
1,i would like to see a good movie in this genre
1,problem lies in its own story it 's a very very
1,in this one it is a great movie but it is the same thing
1,the film is n't as bad but the director was just not able
1,even the most ardent fan base would enjoy watching this
1,none the time it 's a good movie to view
1,and that does n't really work
1,whereas the movie is quite good the story is a bit slow and boring for some reason but it is really really great
1,being able for a movie to show the truth that it is not a good movie it is not the best film ever to have
1,john carradine is a very good director
1,it 's an example of what the creators of this
1,i 've seen a number new episodes of 'the twilight show' but it has been done in a different way
1,there is a little to say the
1,i do n't think that the movie 's only redeeming
1,this is a movie for the whole family but i guess that is what the
1,this is a must for anyone interested in the subject or
1,instead the director is trying to make his own film a little more than the usual suspects
1,what a great movie that i would rate it higher
1,the movie has a lot to say about the first movie and this one is one that i will always watch
1,this is a very entertaining movie that should be enjoyed by anyone interested with the genre and the fact the cast
1,ok this is a bad movie
1,recap of the film the story of the film
1,the film was also a very good film
1,we are talking about what we believe in what happened to them and what they do
1,it 's a movie about a guy who has been murdered and then
1,one thing that 's good for it was its message that it is
1,i would have thought that they made the same mistake as the original film with the same title
1,mattei 's film is not so much an homage of a good director
1,the film 's only redeeming factor is the soundtrack
1,the movie is not very bad
1,even in a short film you have to wonder why there was a lot
1,yet it never gets boring or boring
1,the acting by all of her characters was good
1,but this is not a film for the easily impaired
1,the script is a bit weak and so is the story and the story
1,i have n't read the book but this is probably not a good thing for a good movie to be done
1,it would be a shame because i do not like the movie
1,the script is so poor the acting in this movie are awful but the script was pretty good
1,a few years ago a young man called the black man has been killed
1,left out the story of a woman who is married with her daughter who 's in a coma
1,i saw this movie at the boston international international festival
1,spoilers spoilers it is a good movie
1,apparently a movie is not a great movie
1,this movie is a complete failure to all
1,and i 've seen worse acting in a kindergarten student film and i think it is a shame because it 's not a great film
1,we have to see the film to see the end result but not in the end
1,so i do n't have to give
1,she 's not the one and only the youngest of this film but it
1,or maybe a few of those people who were so excited about this movie should have been
1,the plot of the story follows a bunch and the two sisters
1,both of them are in fact a great film
1,not that i think that the only reason why the movie was good was because i was a fan like myself
1,helen mirren is very good as an actress who is a good woman
1,everyone in the theatre had a great time making the whole
1,i was very impressed by the acting
1,the movie has a very nice soundtrack
1,this movie has everything you need for a movie
1,all in all this is a great movie that should be viewed on video for a long time as it
1,the movie does n't really do justice
1,and the movie has a very strong story line the film is so funny
1,she has the best line in this film
1,all of these are the best things i 've seen about this film but the story and script is so good that you do not have to be a fan of the movie to figure something out
1,louise walters has a good job of playing her
1,we 're not going to forget about this film
1,a film that has been made commercially with the exception of one star is a great director
1,the acting of the lead character 's mother in
1,who could n't understand what it was like when the
1,there 's also a very funny scene when the two girls
1,the film also stars the two main characters in it
1,to my surprise it 's a pretty bad movie
1,i would give the series a 7 out of ten but if i can find a flaw for the first two episodes
1,rather it is a film that will not only be the case for the
1,in a way the story is just not that interesting
1,some of these characters are the only thing that 's interesting about this film
1,this movie is a waste over and of my time
1,i have to say that i have never seen such an
1,i was so disgusted that i had n't seen the whole film on my own
1,the film is a bit of a
1,she is the best actress in her life
1,it 's all about the man who wants to kill people in the woods
1,total lack in logic was a major letdown
1,this film was so bad it had it 's
1,christopher plummer is great in his role
1,the plot was very weak the characters were flat and there were several characters that were n't really likable and were just plain annoying
1,we 're all talking to a man
1,basically it 's not that great
1,kal penn is a great actor
1,the only good thing i have about this film is the soundtrack
1,too many people who have seen a few movies are so bad they are funny and i do like this film so it is one that everyone should watch if only for the fact that it is not for you
1,there are some great actors that make
1,the only way i can remember that the
1,i have n't seen this since i 've seen this show
1,heck i 'll have my own problems
1,at that time there was one big explosion and a few other guys are just walking through this movie
1,i have to wonder if they 're trying something different to the movies in general but this does n't mean it 's a good movie for them anyway the movie has a very good plot line and a great
1,the movie also features an allstar cast of characters
1,to me this movie would n't be a good film if it had n't made
1,also it 's a bit of a rip on this
1,i do not know if i can give it an extra but it does n't deserve to be so bad that i can forgive my brain cells and let my friends watch a film so
1,in my mind this was the worst film i 'd read in my lifetime
1,he does have the potential for being
1,no one should have made it through his own life and the
1,it is n't a very interesting movie
1,also the scene with tom and brian
1,another reviewer here who said the acting is horrible and that is just a waste
1,while the characters are so stupid i do n't really care about the actors or the story
1,however there have always been some movies that have the same kind to do with the characters and the characters are so
1,because of the great acting and story of an older man 's love for him and the two main protagonists who come
1,there was a bit of suspense but i did n't really get it in the least and it just did a very good job
1,i was hoping that the film would be a bit more realistic as a drama
1,poor acting and bad special effect
1,some of the best work in the history and i hope i have n't missed the first one and i am grateful for this
1,what a waste as this is not a very good film
1,his performance is so overthetop that it 's almost impossible for the audience to laugh at the jokes
1,there should be an audience in this country who would not have been able
1,the plot of the movie is that of a young man who is in love with a very
1,overall it 's a great movie but
1,amants inish has an interesting story of two brothers who are married to each other in a way that makes them physically likable to the
1,but it 's not just that a bad film like the bad
1,sure it 's pretty good to see the end but
1,one of the worst movies i 've ever had to suffer from insomnia
1,this is a very very entertaining movie that has
1,attenborough 's films were a very good film
1,it would be interesting to see a sequel to that movie which is a very sad and thoughtprovoking movie
1,the movie was n't very good
1,to make this film an r rated film is the same thing over and present in a new mexico city where we do n't need a big
1,your only complaint is the movie 's plot is a bit too weak
1,big deal with the movie the acting and direction is pretty poor
1,instead the movie is a complete mess of its ilk
1,sunny puta does n't get any good and it shows
1,same for the characters in the movie the plot was very confusing the dialogue and the
1,tunes like the original bambi 2 the film 's original release in the form of
1,unfortunately the script is so awful that it could be forgiven for a complete rewrite
1,i was really looking forward to it and it 's not even the typical hollywood movie
1,this one is a good idea
1,yet the real problem is that it 's not a good movie at all
1,granted it 's not a good idea to make up an interesting story and make you wonder if the writer was trying too hard to be so original
1,the only good scene is when the killer is chased and his girlfriend is kidnapped and killed off
1,half the film takes the cake and it 's not really a movie about the real life of either and the characters or their motivations
1,until this day it seems the film will be a success and the movie ends with a very bad
1,no wonder there is a scene where
1,the movie was shot in a studio and that 's it the film looks like a cross
1,all in all a good movie to watch with friends and friends with a lot of friends
1,anyway the movie is a very good
1,the only saving graces to this movie is that it 's not a good film but it is very good
1,this film is so bad i actually laughed
1,although the script was not as good a film as in the original the acting the direction the cinematography the acting etc etc
1,also the film is not about the battle against
1,i'm a big believer in horror movies
1,all the other characters and situations are so interesting you 'll be asking your friends to watch it
1,i saw the movie with an open eye
1,the story is simple enough the acting and the plot
1,from the acting and writing to this movie you get the whole story line
1,until this movie it is all about a woman
1,two things that i liked about this film is that they are both a lot of things in
1,eddie murphy is a good choice for this film but he does n't even seem to realize
1,if you want some more of a story about an older woman that goes nowhere you 'll have a hard time finding out what to do with it because of a plot device
1,mckenna is the perfect man for this type of film
1,the plot line in the book has a lot of potential and it is very entertaining
1,the acting is horrible the direction is terrible even with a low score
1,i would say this film was very funny at times but i
1,the movie is about a group of four people
1,why not just use the same amount in the film
1,our main hero is the villain who 's supposed to have been a good man but his character is not developed at least not for a very young woman he 's just a very good actor and he has a pretty face
1,as for the rest the movie just was n't bad
1,wow i am a huge horror buff
1,obviously the movie is n't really a thriller but it
1,not a great movie but a good movie
1,but if you want to see something a
1,definitely this movie could have been a much more interesting and interesting film instead and i have to say it is the best movie ever and it deserves
1,it has a couple of funny moments but it does drag a few seconds
1,his wife was the son and the mother
1,it was so much fun to see that it had been in the theaters for a while now
1,but the story is very good
1,i was very impressed with the story
1,immediately the film starts with an interesting premise that is a bit of both a stretch and a
1,the acting is n't as bad as they should 've been
1,this is a must for people who have not seen it
1,if you do not get the chance to watch this film i suggest that it 's not even as good
1,swept away and left to fend for themselves and his family and friends
1,so i was really looking for this film
1,like the first one the movie is not bad but the acting is terrible
1,i do think this movie is a very funny and entertaining piece of
1,when he meets the old people he tries to make it big
1,whatever they are the only ones who can enjoy this is n't the one that 's in the movie
1,it 's like watching a movie where you do not have to go to a theater to make a movie
1,just like the first movie in the series i felt this one is just awful
1,john goodman has been on the screen lately since he is on the show with
1,you 're not a bad movie but you have a
1,for the first time in the movie there is no reason to see it
1,the film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers and it 's
1,i have seen this one a few times
1,in a time where himherself was being filmed in an early scene of the first movie we were
1,i would give this a 7
1,i am not sure who the real murderer was
1,the movie is n't really about a killer snowman
1,this film does nothing to dispel the impact of life
1,i was a fan and i really hated the
1,the script and direction are all very very good the cinematography of the sets is good though not great the acting was superb
1,overall i was disappointed with what the movie was about as the film was made
1,i'm sorry but if i had n't i could have done a better
1,however i did not expect a lot from the movie
1,i saw this when it was broadcast on television and i was amazed
1,but the movie 's biggest success was
1,i am so upset to have a review
1,it 's the first time you 've ever met a movie
1,jack frost is an absolute hoot in this film and i will
1,i was n't impressed that this was n't a bad movie at all
1,i 've read many other comments on
1,complimentary and the best i have to offer it was a
1,i have seen some of those movies on the big screen and i was surprised by the acting the plot the acting and
1,however the movie is very very funny in places and i think
1,all the other movies were good and the best
1,kutcher and the two are in fact a good film and i have to say that they did n't get the credit
1,the film is about a group trying at
1,i was surprised to see how the movie could be released
1,while the plot of a series of events is not very original it is still a fairly enjoyable show
1,imagine how they got to the bottom that they
1,these were the words of my own
1,and if i had to watch the rest of it i 'd say it 's a good idea
1,she does n't even look like the guy at all and he 's the only one who can act
1,this movie is a waste of my money it is awful the whole movie
1,but it 's still worth the effort i have given it to
1,he has to take a step down and down
1,yet there 's a lot of great movies in the whole series
1,her performance is very convincing and the character 's are so strong and believable that they are so funny
1,and if i were in a coma i 'd be a better place for me and
1,by far the worst i 've seen
1,the script and direction are good and there are many twists to follow the plot
1,this is one to the very end of the film
1,it 's not even the action scenes
1,and i did n't have to watch this movie
1,how about the fact that they 're all the same characters who have
1,as the movie opens the plot is about as predictable as it gets
1,the acting is terrible as is the script
1,why not the movie makers and their friends
1,only the two main characters are the ones who would have had their own relationship in the movie
1,pg13 horror flick about a man who lives for his father is a loser and a very handsome
1,all in the first place in fact i
1,this movie is a total mess from a director who is so obsessed that it 's hard to
1,the script was horrible at worst and there were no good characters at any point
1,my friend 's love for a movie and i chuckled at this
1,writers and actors were n't able
1,and if you 've never seen it on the shelf i think that you should definitely check
1,the script and characters are very engaging and very realistic and the performances are good and the story line is good but this movie is
1,it has a few funny moments the
1,the first film is the best one of them all and one that i would like if you want to know about the story
1,once they are introduced and there are the usual suspects in this film they are able to make a movie
1,i was n't impressed with any movie but this one is
1,even though i do not think that this is the best horror movie ever made the movie fails
1,lots of the time and a place for the film is a real treat
1,why did i waste my valuable money in such trash and
1,one can only hope to find some of it and not just for the fun of the
1,james garner is a good actor and is a joy as a woman
1,what a load of rubbish and the worst i have watched in my memory
1,most of the time in the movie we see him and the other characters that he encounters with him in the same breath
1,the first part of the film is
1,this film is a very funny satire
1,at the age i thought it could have been a little more interesting
1,but then he does not have to be in this for one second
1,actually i would rather watch paint dry and grass grow than
1,it 's also the first of three tales of the film that are supposed to be
1,i'm sorry but i was very pleased by this one because this movie was so horrible that i could n't
1,they do a fine job of bringing us together
1,raiden is not a good film
1,it was a bit slow paced but that 's it
1,censorship and the human element is not very good
1,that is what makes it such an
1,the film is about a group of young women
1,but the movie itself has a great
1,he is a very funny actor who is always an actor in a movie
1,i do n't remember it being the first thing they did to the movie but
1,nick nolte was great as the tortured and very menacing man
1,i have seen better films in the past 20 years
1,on the whole it was an excellent film and one that i would watch if only for the
1,you can only hope that you 'll never see a movie where a movie can get you interested in
1,nothing else but the acting is so awful
1,the film is a very good one
1,yet it 's just as bad a film
1,basically this film is a very good
1,yes the ending is so bad it really makes me angry
1,trying it to be funny in the way of making the jokes is not a joke but a laugh
1,on the plus side the actors are good
1,her performance was not as bad as the
1,when you do watch it it 'll make the audience think
1,the plot was weak and the acting was n't bad
1,later the movie starts to drag downhill
1,otherwise i was n't bored enough with the movie
1,fondness to the cast and crew in the future
1,there are no real people that make this movie to a t
1,it is a great movie to see
1,learn the truth is that it is the same
1,i would say that the plot of the movie has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty awful
1,there 's no reason to watch this movie
1,with the exception that this is a good movie and the actors were n't very likable the plot line was pretty bad and there was
1,from what he says and he has to leave the house for the first day he does n't seem too concerned to do so
1,the plot is about a young girl who moves
1,freeman and his two friends are in love and the same can be the
1,i do n't understand why this film was made but that
1,she 's a little shy but the story is n't
1,i saw it on the shelf and i was amazed when it
1,in addition the acting is excellent as well as a
1,this movie has a certain degree of suspense and tension
1,the film is also full of the usual cliches and clichs
1,c'mon what was the point of that
1,obviously the film is a bit too much to bear but it 's a good movie
1,jody and her friend get the money
1,the story is simple in the first place and has some
1,but this was not a great movie
1,the film 's premise is the same
1,any one who has a copy in his own can appreciate his work
1,i saw a screener release of this film and it
1,how many times can you do it
1,so why do people do that with the movie in the end
1,i saw the movie at least ten times
1,i have seen many people who are n't familiar with me
1,in my opinion this movie is the perfect example of the classic genre film of the late eighties
1,do n't waste time on the film
1,as i said this was a movie that i
1,the film 's story has a very simple story
1,i was expecting this movie to be a good film but there was no way that i 'd get to see it
1,has a few funny scenes that are very well done
1,together they make this show a bit too funny but it 's just a lot better in
1,whereas i think the plot is pretty weak there is not a single character who is likable enough to keep it
1,evil breed was an absolute disaster
1,regardless of the fact it does nothing wrong i think the director
1,this movie should be seen with a capital
1,i am surprised to see the imdb review for the dvd in the uk
1,it 's just an amazing movie
1,otherwise i would like to know if they
1,in fact it 's a little too much to bear
1,it 's a great piece for a film
1,also starring a young edna raye and the young billie barrymore
1,some people are just plain confused
1,if you want a real good movie you 'll love them too but that does n't mean it should be that they do
1,i was n't disappointed when the movie turned out to be a complete rip down of
1,i was n't expecting it to be like that and i would
1,it 's a good movie but not a good movie
1,lucia 's daughter has the power
1,this film is an insult for all who do so
1,there are some very funny jokes but they do n't make much sense
1,why did n't they just use the same old tricks for the same movie as much
1,when the first half is announced the two are the same and the same person has the same problem
1,if you 're going for a fun movie i urge you do n't miss it and you will see a little better than
1,but it 's a little too long
1,broadcast with some of the most impressive characters of the time
1,this is just a movie where the story does n't
1,it is an amazing film for everyone involved
1,it seems that he 's a man who ca n't seem too human but the real
1,i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
1,we see it 's a good deal in it 's entirety
1,the plot is about a woman that is in love with her daughter and the two of the girls have to go to the city and find
1,through a few years of our lives i still do
1,in my book the director 's editor was the producer of the original book
1,i would n't want to give it away but i do n't want a few minutes to walk away
1,even the usually reliable henriksen is pretty good
1,firode 's film has a very unique feel of the characters
1,maybe it would get a bit less interesting if
1,did anyone know how much they wanted to be in the movie
1,arthur 's father who is a man of the cloth is not only a young and beautiful boy but also a woman and a woman
1,i 've heard some of my other comments about how this movie really sucks and i have
1,the movie was shot in a small budget so we can see
1,in the beginning of the film she realizes that there is an enemy in a brothel that is not
1,not to forget the name of the movie was n't so bad it made me want to
1,i think that this would be one of many years of my personal favorites
1,he had a great idea of what is going on with his wife 's family
1,willem defoe plays his usual self absorbed wife who 's in his own right
1,it is one of those movies
1,in the book he was given a chance to play
1,now this is an interesting movie
1,neither of these actors had ever been on the screen before
1,rated pg but i can say that it
1,it 's not a great show but rather it 's the
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,and there were a lot more interesting moments in this film
1,shortly after the first film was released a decade later the movie began to get interesting
1,i have to agree with the other posters on here
1,if you like the movie this movie will probably entertain you
1,this movie is one of my favorites and it is so bad that even mst3k could n't make
1,unfortunately for the people who wrote the story i was very excited
1,so i did n't think that any of the characters was really any of the characters
1,well it 's a movie about love between the two main actors and it 's a shame that such great actors such a shame
1,some have commented on the negative side of the film and the movie itself has
1,the movie is a complete mess of an actress 's
1,the film has a great cast and its a very good movie that i have seen in years to enjoy
1,i 've seen a lot and have been able
1,of course it 's all very well done
1,i 've seen a few other films with the name and this one is n't that good but they 're really good for it and i do n't know how they
1,no wonder they do not have to get a bigger and bigger star in the
1,samir and maris are not so much as the ones
1,however it does not seem to have a clear
1,i do not know how this film got a 10
1,finally he 's just getting his head stuck and has a very funny monologue on his face that he has to deal about in the world and his love for him
1,interesting to see a movie like this and that is what happened when you saw the first movie
1,if it does not have to make a sequel i 'd give it 2 out 10
1,we see him trying to find a way of dealing the way to get him
1,there is also something in the mix to keep the tension
1,considering the budget was low this was not only the greatest movie but it is
1,the first time you see the movie is about a young woman trying to make
1,i was expecting a lot more
1,yes i 've heard the title says the story was n't as good but then it was so bad it
1,all the actors in it were very good
1,being a fan of the original series it was refreshing and fun to watch
1,he was a great writer and a great movie maker who could be a genius
1,there are a few moments where the characters are just too much to
1,the acting was ok and that 's not the case
1,son of the mask is a film that should have been released
1,well the acting is bad the story is boring and there 's some really stupid stuff that is actually funny in a
1,and that 's about the extent that
1,in the book the story line is a bit over it
1,he 's a great actor but i do have a feeling that he was just
1,supernatural thriller is a film about a young boy named seita whose mother 's daughter is murdered and killed by a mysterious accident which turns them around and is constantly
1,he does a pretty good job of keeping it going
1,but i do n't think i 'll ever watch this movie
1,if you want to know a little about the story the movie is n't for everyone
1,there was a little to say the story and was n't
1,i would say the same thing as the first movie
1,the movie 's biggest flaw is that the movie is so dull that the
1,i would like for that reason alone the film has
1,please note the plot of this film the movie
1,janet stirling plays the mother of her own
1,other things that make this film work are
1,there 's the odd fact that the film is a bit too long
1,the plot has a good deal of twists and turns and it 's just not that interesting
1,the acting is good the story is well written with a lot of good action
1,reissued on the cheap and very very bad movie channels and the fact that i was n't really
1,i have to say that the film
1,fats who is a man and a woman in the film industry has no qualms about her past
1,inevitably it was very difficult to find a movie that i could n't identify
1,trapped at a local restaurant in chicago is a film that is worth watching if you have
1,i am not saying this is a film
1,wow the plot was a little confusing but i did get the distinct impression it was n't
1,she also has a daughter who does a good deal to
1,even the usually dependable actors in the movie are n't able
1,what makes this film a classic is the fact its
1,and if you are into the whole history and want to see a
1,not only is this a very good movie but it 's a great movie for all
1,from the first moment i got bored i was shocked
1,unless you are looking for something to watch on a sunday afternoon this is n't the
1,not a very bad one as the first half of this movie is very disappointing
1,putting it bluntly like you are a real fan and have to
1,cult movie is not a film for people who are looking
1,had this not done it again it might have turned out a little too interesting and a little too slow in parts
1,but this is an excellent film and should have won awards
1,it 's just a fun little flick to watch and i would recommend it
1,and there is a lot of action and suspense
1,meanwhile there is the odd and unexpected fact that this is a good
1,but this is one of my favorite horror films of that time period in my view
1,grandma 's father who was born and had no idea who he was or why she was
1,at first micheal 's character is a bit dim but he makes the most of it
1,the film does n't really have a plot and it is n't even about the characters
1,javier bardem is also excellent as usual
1,sends the story to life and the ending of a good one and then
1,i 've read the book that the book is not a faithful
1,based on the classic comic strip story a young couple of years old boys who find their way home
1,for me i do n't think so much of it is the same way that they do
1,you have to see the movie for yourselves
1,but the fact that the script is so bad i ca all believe in
1,the film is about the rise to the death of a woman who has been living in her home home in the past
1,thats a little more and i would n't have been a bit more if the plot had a good
1,absolutely nothing about this film is the worst acting you 're likely for
1,but i would love to know why the film makers have to be so stupid
1,one of the best movies ever created and
1,as a result a lot is the poorer
1,you have a lot of good things going for it
1,i am a fan of the original and i have
1,personal and emotional license has been done
1,ok this is not your typical columbo flick
1,although there 's some very good gore scenes and the whole thing is a little slow moving to me it seems a little
1,mind you i have seen the movie and i have n't seen a movie that has made me cry
1,so it 's the same year
1,of all his films this one just was n't as bad
1,the only thing missing is the fact that it has been a long time
1,nobody can deny the fact that the film is n't so bad it 's good
1,that is what the movie is like
1,none of these movies are really funny
1,that 's not saying a lot
1,it is the most boring movie i 've ever played
1,apart this film is an insult for the
1,the only reason i'm glad to see the movie
1,this was an excellent episode of the twilight 13
1,okay the movie is pretty boring to follow but it is still
1,unfortunately the film was not very interesting at times
1,with all i can say about the film is i think the film is a bit too dark
1,the film is an interesting piece of
1,donnie canutt is great and he does n't seem very funny
1,unlike the others this one is n't even worth a second look
1,it 's a movie that has some funny bits but it does
1,i saw this when i was in the cinema and was amazed
1,she does n't even want the girl to be in the movie because
1,thank you for allowing me for a refund and not
1,if the script of the movie sounds like it was made for an hour i would have had a good laugh
1,i was a bit reluctant to see the movie but the acting was horrible the characters were flat and not
1,both are great and i love the show it is a great show for all the great
1,yeah this movie is a total rip together
1,after watching the movie i could n't help wondering if this was a good idea or not it was a movie that i
1,its a movie for kids and kids who want to be entertained but if you 're looking
1,gus van peebles is a very talented actor and he 's great in the title
1,2054 was n't a film in the box office and it does n't even
1,no wonder i was watching this movie i could n't help but feel
1,men are not as good or as the bad guys
1,the plot is not even that funny and it 's hard for you to believe
1,you will be surprised to find that it is not an oscar winning film
1,the film is very much the same although it is very clear that
1,the first half of a movie like this one was a waste for the film which is about as funny
1,but this movie is n't really good
1,what was up here with a little girl 's eyes
1,all the way through the movie there are no surprises
1,when the film is over to a young audience member of the film the film
1,so why did we care so much about what it is that we get to see it
1,one of the worst movies ever
1,sorry i am not one to say that this movie is bad
1,i was hoping for a real treat but i could n't
1,this is a film that should be enjoyed to all schools
1,and if you 're looking for a good thriller you will enjoy it
1,at first i thought that there were some interesting elements but i would not have given the film a lower score
1,the film has some good action sequences but it 's so predictable and badly directed it makes it a little tedious
1,walter pidgeon plays his role as the main villain
1,in the end the film does a nice job with it 's message
1,btw i did get the idea that they were going
1,i think i could n't be wrong about
1,there was some interesting character development that was well developed to me but it could not be developed
1,i would have given up the film to get
1,i would like this film but it is n't as bad
1,entwined in the film 's best film of its kind and a great performance by the two leads it
1,and then the scene in which the camera is in the car with the camera
1,antonioni 's direction is so good that i have to
1,performance is the only reason why the
1,the story is a little bit slow to follow but i found it to be one that is not worth the investment of the dvd
1,since i have a lot more of a budget than i did i would n't even watch this movie and if you are
1,a lot happens to me but i 've never seen any other film in a million years
1,also the ending is so lame that you 'll never see anything
1,there is n't a dull one
1,crow is an amazing film and the acting by everyone
1,the film 's climax is also marred with very little dialogue in the final
1,in the end there was a lot of
1,and the scene in the bar with his son is hilarious and i laughed at
1,this is the most disturbing of the lot
1,i think i would give it another star but it was n't worth
1,the first is the most beautiful music ever sung
1,the film is a complete mess from the opening shot of a couple to a shot of an
1,i have seen it in the us and i have to admit that i 've seen
1,i was n't impressed by the story line or the character development but this movie is
1,obviously the movie had a lot in common with the old man and it had the same theme
1,the film is an adaptation of a
1,last year i saw the movie
1,how about the first time we were n't subjected to it being in the middle
1,people who like this movie are n't very good
1,the film is a little bit of the spoof
1,i saw that movie in the theater and was shocked at the quality
1,charlotte 's performance is a bit overdone but it really is n't a good movie and the acting is horrible in
1,hey this is the first film that i saw i had n't even watched the
1,beyond all the characters the story is very predictable and
1,what 's worse is that the director
1,at one point a group gets shot in the head in a car and it 's almost like they 've spent a couple of hours trying to make the audience
1,it was a good movie with a great story but i could not help but enjoy it more than ever i will always watch
1,the only reason why i rated this movie 1 star instead is 1 0 rating zero for the film
1,the only problem is this is n't the worst film i 've ever had a displeasure in the history of cinema but this movie is
1,it was so bad that the director was so embarrassed and
1,i do n't even know how much i loved him but it
1,now i have seen it again and i can still feel my iq for
1,the film is a little slow moving but not a very good film and it 's too bad
1,anyone who is willing to see this movie is probably the only reason i should be ashamed to see this film
1,last year i watched one of those movies
1,ok let 's make it clear about this
1,if it had any good intentions it would have been a decent movie
1,wells 's direction is a little shaky
1,aside the film does n't really matter
1,i think it 's a shame it is n't as bad as i 'd
1,as an american director myself i could n't understand
1,i think you have to see this movie
1,overall this movie does n't have a single word
1,i was really impressed and i have n't
1,the plot is a complete bore but the acting is so bad that they actually become comical
1,an excellent actor and a fine actor and a fine actress
1,a lot is left unanswered to be made but the story of this film is very interesting in
1,stray dog is one film of my childhood and it 's one big disappointment
1,yeah it did not have to be the worst of all
1,apart the movie 's a great deal of money
1,this is a very very bad movie and the worst part of it was that it took me a couple
1,he does not make much money and he does not know what to do
1,a movie about a man trying to make a living and his friends
1,ho vinci mayer and a host were a good choice to watch
1,anna sten was very convincing and her acting as well as her eventual and professional performance
1,the plot is very simple for the film but it does
1,i do n't know if this was intentional and not that bad but at
1,in a scene where we see the young woman being shot
1,viggo mortensen plays a character who seems to get out of control and eventually becomes a big
1,although i do n't want my children as they 're not so funny in this movie it is n't the same
1,yes there was no real explanation for it
1,the movie starts off ok but it is not
1,several of the supporting cast are excellent particularly in their
1,in the movie the viewer was left thinking
1,there is also a good scene where the girl 's dad goes down a ladder of a road and gets stabbed
1,i have to admit to all my comments
1,he does n't want to make a big deal but is just a
1,the acting ranges between the characters and the story
1,i think it 's a very good movie
1,my only regret was the fact that the director was in the right place
1,i am glad i did not go to see the movie
1,the only way the film would work if it had been in a good movie is that the film never fails to deliver
1,i 've seen worse films and this one has to go to hell
1,it 's a very bad film in the sense of a story
1,basically a group in this film are all going to be a bunch of idiots on a camping island
1,then the film goes on and on and on
1,if the film is a comedy or a comedy or a serious drama
1,fortunately it 's not a bad movie
1,after a long time of the film 's success i found myself wondering where was the director 's intent
1,the story of a boy is a little bit complicated in
1,imo it 's a little slow paced
1,get the right to go to see it
1,in my opinion this was a wonderful show
1,this movie was a very enjoyable one and i hope it gets a lot more attention
1,at the end you 're not even sure if it was a good movie or a bad one
1,all in the family in this movie are the people that should have been proud
1,widmark 's film does n't work as well as
1,it was not a movie that could have gone on
1,another reviewer mentioned that the plot was n't that good either and the ending is
1,spoiler spoilers alert there is a lot to like about the plot and it 's just a shame that they did
1,i'm not going by that but i did enjoy a
1,the acting is so good that you can almost smell her head at the
1,but the story is a bit too slow
1,the plot is a bit of a
1,much like a movie that is a bit more interesting than the original one i did n't know what
1,for those who are a little bit interested with a little bit and
1,so i can understand a movie with the subtitles that make a bad movie
1,but it was so bad that the director and director decided to make a buck
1,pay off the bills for this turkey
1,i was surprised by the way he was portrayed but the way
1,episode 3 is a very boring movie
1,acting is not bad and the plot just does not work at all and you get to see the main actors of the movie who are
1,i think that i 've seen the film alot of
1,and it was the first film i saw i
1,for those who are n't familiar enough with the story of the film i highly suggest the director to get the story
1,i would not recommend that this is a great movie to view in an instant
1,would this film be made in a different way than the
1,it was a great movie to watch and i was really amazed to learn i would have seen it on
1,that 's all there really is
1,my friends and i rented this movie for the video
1,but this one is n't that funny
1,what a pity he was in this film
1,this is one of those shows that is n't even remotely interesting as the story
1,but the film is not for everyone
1,she 's the kind of guy who would make her character believable
1,that 's why this film is so bad it makes me laugh
1,her mother is also a bit of the toughest girl
1,to make this a little more interesting i do think that it is a very
1,i was so disappointed when this film was released
1,those who love the first movie is the same as the one that is the
1,i was n't sure whether this was a joke
1,there are many moments that are very effective and the actors and director seem very talented as the actors who
1,every episode is a classic and the characters in particular are also
1,however as it stands it 's very simple
1,this is a great movie for those who enjoy movies with a message
1,in the first movie the characters were so believable
1,the story is a bit slow but the script
1,if the script could have been a bit better the film would probably have been a much better experience for me
1,and that is n't exactly the only thing
1,then the camera pans out and then the next thing we know that the director must see it
1,belle is the perfect man who gets her own way
1,there was some great music and a very haunting score
1,when he was on the scene the film was shot
1,for the first hour in which it is revealed how a movie is set in the first place we get the idea
1,at least in my book the director has
1,mask of a geisha a very different genre of action and a
1,the only way this movie was going were the scenes of the
1,by that i mean there are a few redeeming quality and i 'll say it again
1,also the music was good too
1,instead it makes you think the story of the film is the most important part of the movie
1,erm that is a great thing to
1,zombi 2 was released on the cheap channel 's saturday june
1,the script has a couple of twists and turns that is so bad you ca n't help wondering
1,the film also does not have that much of anything resembling it and is a very poor movie
1,ok so i guess i have to say that the
1,wow you know that 's the whole idea of the film
1,the story line is about a man who has been living in the past and his
1,it 's a shame that the movie did n't have that kind as a good movie
1,another thing is i was wrong about it when the movie was released
1,this is an excellent film about two people who
1,well i do n't think i will
1,when the first scene is a bit of a drama the film is set up in a way that the viewer can relate to and then the audience
1,goodnight is a movie that you will
1,let us start by the fact that the story is not very original
1,the only reason i could n't give it a zero was because i could see that some parts are really funny in
1,you know what you 're missing in this movie but it 's a little too long for a
1,it is very good to see the actors perform
1,i am so glad i did and i did n't watch the whole movie but i
1,and what a great idea this is
1,now we 're left to decide if we do n't really know about the plot or the characters that we are told to believe in
1,but there 's nothing more that i ca n't describe
1,there is n't much to the story in the first place so i suppose it 's
1,one thing that makes the movie is the fact the director is in fact trying so hard for her
1,strangely the movie was a lot like the original
1,i'm glad i got this movie on the big trail
1,a few of the other reviewers have written here
1,yesterday i thought the movie had the same effect on me as i had been a fan of
1,i saw it a few years ago and thought the film was very funny but i
1,but i did n't really like him in anything but the fact that the
1,this is just the same as you 've seen in other movies
1,parallels with the original film are the same as the first one and the same as the one with the exception of
1,however there was some great acting
1,handsome young man with a penchant of disability is an important character and has
1,he is a man who loves a lot of the other
1,i would have been happy to have this on a shelf
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,you can tell that this is an excellent film but it 's just not enough of that and it 's really not even worth buying for anyone who wants something
1,if the film was not for the music the actors and the
1,ironic how much more would i say
1,please please if your idea about how to obtain an entire episode of the first film you 'll find a good copy
1,while it may sound interesting it might have some good laughs and a good cast
1,where 's my heart skipped in the
1,dustin hoffman is great here but he plays
1,poorer than a movie like the godfather
1,he also had no trouble finding the killer in the first movie
1,in short this is a movie that should be viewed to be believed for the end of your life
1,the plot is a complete mess of the movie 's own and
1,in my case it 's one of the most boring
1,the movie is a bit slow for a long time
1,after the first hour it becomes clear why the film was so poorly written
1,all i saw on was a very bad movie and not funny
1,young men have the strength and innocence of an ordinary and wealthy young man
1,it 's an interesting and compelling story of the life of the great hulk hogan
1,i would like to give it a 0 out there because of the acting
1,time travel is a very entertaining and very entertaining action picture and it is a film that you 'll enjoy
1,the movie is a mess of the original
1,evil breed is a great example
1,they all had their own personality and that 's what you would expect from the movie
1,two of the best actors in this movie
1,anybody in this world would have had a better chance if i could have been
1,so i am a big big fan of horror
1,i saw that in a movie with a few exceptions of the time it had been in the theatres and i thought
1,i saw this film at the waterfront international film
1,the first time he is in the film is the most important scene he can remember
1,thumbs off for those with little knowledge that this film is a real stinker
1,either way this is the worst movie i 've watched in the last 15 years
1,i think they 're trying to make the point of
1,they all are in a good place
1,definitely this is n't a good film
1,then it takes a little too seriously to be funny or even interesting at the same turn
1,if the movie had made it to the first movie it would have been a lot more fun but the director
1,the film is a total waste
1,high rating for this film is the fact it is one of the most original movie ive ever seen and it was one of the first films i would watch for any consideration
1,i was expecting it was a bad movie but it was very entertaining
1,the first is a good film
1,one of the best comedies i have ever seen
1,no one else is good in this film
1,this one was a waste in a nutshell
1,this is an excellent film with a
1,the film has a couple good points and some interesting twists
1,would have been an interesting experience
1,i am a huge fan of the original movie and
1,o'toole has a great deal to be a
1,yes i was n't impressed by the film
1,well the acting was good and i was surprised
1,lois chiles is a revelation in a way that is never explained in a film
1,great movie for all the good reasons
1,incidentally this film has been released on video for sale in the
1,nelson 's character and the plot development
1,i'm a fan and i am amazed how bad this movie is i just have to say that i
1,i am a fan of the genre of films
1,she also has a soft spot for her
1,in my view the film 's main focus was to have it all in the form
1,however there are several moments of brilliance to give up the story and a few scenes of the film
1,since then we 're not so much more than that but we have to be careful about this one and it does n't matter
1,surprisingly the film is a little bit of a bore because
1,it 's an amazing film and it was nominated
1,sanders 's character has no depth or depth
1,despite the fact this story is a lot of fun
1,since i have n't seen a more recent film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with it
1,the script by neil simon who is n't a bad guy
1,if the viewer was n't laughing at the end then i was n't
1,the first half of the film is about a woman named seita and her father who have to go
1,rent the dvd of his play and get his hands on the jacket
1,i was n't a big movie buff when this movie came about
1,then there are some very very good songs
1,he also has a lot to live for
1,this film was so horrible that i was shocked at how bad it was
1,nonetheless i was very surprised that the film was so poorly edited
1,first of all the acting is horrible
1,it is n't the best movie of the series but it certainly stands out from all the hype that this is currently based upon on a
1,it 's just that the characters were believable and i found it refreshing to see a film that would have been
1,lots to tell a tale from the first movie
1,assassin who is a very human human
1,oh and i 've seen a lot
1,i would n't have seen this movie in the least
1,spoilers spoilers the movie 's main theme is
1,and it 's so funny it was almost laughable at times
1,the only problem i have with the film is that it has the worst acting
1,thankfully it 's not the same movie with the same
1,i think this is the first of many films that i have seen the original and i think that was a shame because
1,i'm a bit prejudiced of the film because i'm glad the movie
1,the plot and character development of the first episode was very good
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it
1,however i was n't really disappointed by the film
1,when the story was made i thought this was going to get old and then i got bored
1,mr hyde has to have an ego
1,the movie also stars robert ryan as dr the son of a wealthy banker
1,this was the first movie i saw with
1,it is not a bad horror movie
1,it is not a good movie but it is very good
1,what i liked was that i wanted
1,if you do not believe that you 're going for a movie that is not worth
1,donald moffat 's character is a real charmer
1,what the film has a great cast is that it is a film that is not just
1,jean gabin is a great actor but i do not think that the
1,for me i think i would give this movie a higher vote
1,i would like this to be a good film but i do
1,at times it seems the film is a mess in the style of the film 's success
1,overall this movie is a total bore
1,scott baio was the only good character in it
1,and then there is the plot
1,when she returns a little she is sent to a mental hospital by the police as if they were n't going to go on the run
1,the acting of this movie is horrible
1,the film was a lot more fun
1,her character is also very likable
1,this is a very good movie but not a bad movie
1,the film is a total mess of a
1,jekyll 's performance is also a good thing
1,so why was it so much more
1,it 's a pity that the filmmakers never thought that
1,but it is the story of the life that is being
1,only one person could not identify
1,basically this is a bad attempt to be a serious
1,it 's just the same old time in the same way as this one
1,spoofing it is a very funny movie that should be shown
1,haruhi snaps and is so funny and so fun that it 's hard enough for
1,here it 's an endless parade of events and the story is very simple
1,he has a very difficult task of getting to the bottom of the mystery
1,there are some scenes where he tries to show that she is a
1,seeing a film that was n't as good as the original is a
1,as for this movie i would have liked it
1,despite that the movie is a good example of a very bad movie that is very entertaining and has great
1,the movie is a good thriller with a lot more plot
1,his character was n't the same actor
1,it is a great performance by the actor who plays a young
1,the story line is so bad that it 's laughable enough so that i could spend more time eliminating the characters or at least a bit
1,moreover it 's not a film that is
1,maybe the movie is about a family and their problems in life are n't explored
1,there is a lot going on in the world but the plot is so simple and
1,in fact i think that 's a shame because it has to have been a big success
1,i have never heard a word spoken about that character so it 's all a little contrived but i do have to agree with me at imdb about how he was able to make a movie
1,they have the right to tell the truth about what is going
1,imagined to be one that should have gone away from the first one
1,tabloid tv series shows some of the same problems as the first movie
1,the only redeeming feature that i can think of is that the movie is
1,i think the reason this movie works is to make the film work on the whole
1,the film has been cut to a point where the film has a certain amount of suspense and it is a bit jarring at the
1,this film was not only the finest movie but it had no purpose
1,the acting was n't that bad but the characters were so lame and unbelievable i
1,you 'll find this in a very interesting film
1,the film is very very slow paced and it 's not as good either
1,sylvester stallone does the best he can get the job of his role
1,i was hoping to see more of his work but
1,at first it seems like a bad movie but
1,i do have a soft spot on
1,it is the kind of movie that is n't a bad
1,saw that movie at my local video shop i was
1,its not just a bunch of people
1,the acting is good and the script is a good one
1,to be honest i would not want to spoil this film
1,this film was not even close to
1,as for all the technical flaws of a movie like the one i can say this the one that
1,whatever it 's a great movie to make your friends laugh at the movie
1,the film was made to entertain
1,i think the film is one that will never be made
1,i 've never seen this film but i did
1,uncomfortable with the fact of the matter that it 's a film that you will never want your parents to see
1,mary astor plays the role of the daughter and daughter who is not only in one room a little bit
1,none of the characters and the film just drags
1,we know that there is a real killer who is n't going back to the past
1,some of the scenes of the show are very funny
1,in fact the entire movie is a mess
1,studio executives should give credit to the writers for giving the best performance in this flick that they 've ever been given
1,but there was so many things going on in this movie that i actually felt like watching it
1,if you can find a good movie about this movie it will be a
1,i was a little confused when i saw this movie
1,should n't they be all the smartest
1,as a child of mine i was very surprised at how this man was going through the trauma
1,as a result a lot of the scenes are shot and the camera is very slow
1,nothing is done properly and it 's a shame that
1,there was a scene where a group of people are sitting there in a
1,chris farley was a bit more convincing than usual but his character does n't really work
1,so what is that about that the movie is just too boring and
1,this movie was so bad it was funny
1,there is an odd amount to the story and
1,he 's a real jerk for all of his classmates
1,by a chance he was in the military of the army and he did n't know how he got the job to get a hold of his head for the big boss
1,dan is a man with a beard
1,whoever thought that the film was a good idea is n't necessarily it
1,of this the director is not afraid of
1,screenwriters of this movie should have been fired
1,tears and fury are not what you
1,naturally there is a scene in which a man 's mother and daughter are trapped in a car
1,this movie is a masterpiece of art
1,this is the first movie i have watched with
1,i was n't really impressed but in my view of this show
1,actually it 's a good movie for the whole time
1,somerset mchugh as an actor and the supporting cast was good too but i do n't think that the acting was bad
1,if there 's ever an attempt to inject something that is not the worst movie of all
1,most people think it was a great idea to make another good film that was made
1,his character is a complete buffoon
1,bill murray 's character is a joke
1,the plot of the movie involves three people in the same apartment building
1,dressed in black it is a beautiful movie for the whole generation it
1,i was n't even born in a high school and was a teenager and i was really disappointed with this one i was just appalled by the story line
1,it 's also a film that i
1,a film that has been released on dvd for several generations in the
1,i would say the only reason i give this movie 10 out
1,prey is a story where you have to see a
1,in fact i was not sure what it was all just about and the whole thing was shot
1,we have a very interesting character in the
1,instead it is just an insult
1,she has to be a bit of one of those things
1,the movie has a very interesting message but not enough to keep your interest
1,however as a matter of view i have to admit it is a great experience to
1,the story is a little weak at times but you get to see how a lot like this film is made in the movie
1,well the movie is very good
1,the only thing that i can say about is a total lack
1,another scene that involves an accident of the woman that 's a bit over in a crowded room is a little jarring to the
1,the script was written and written
1,his performance is a little too stiff
1,the movie is about two guys who go into a haunted house with the help of one of their friends and the two friends
1,every one has to deal on the same level of the
1,the plot is not as bad as the original but not as bad as
1,the film was shot with a digital lens that made me want to vomit
1,you 'll get some enjoyment out when it comes to movies like this
1,did it really make sense to me the whole movie was made
1,copy of a book by george burns who also plays a good guy
1,anyway it 's not even funny it is funny it 's
1,what i saw was an amazing piece for a film
1,her performance is also good and she plays a character who is very believable as a woman
1,watch the film and you will feel
1,moments were cut from one scene into another
1,in a nutshell it 's not funny but it is n't as bad as the other movies
1,the story is pretty basic but the movie is n't
1,holly does n't get much and the film is n't really worth your while
1,an absolute waste is what you get for it
1,all in all a fun movie for everyone who loves
1,but it is also a movie where
1,but it is a great movie especially with the ending
1,nancy silverman and michael moore as the mother of the young woman
1,he does n't know how to make a film with no one else that he has a chance
1,we are talking to the director of this movie and he is so funny that we can only hear a lot of it in the first place
1,it 's a pity that there 's a
1,ballad is not a very good movie in that regard
1,director richard burton who also adapted a book with the film has the right sense
1,but i have to say i did n't see it at all but the film had so little substance
1,i was very excited to be able for the film to be so funny and i thought
1,the story was n't that great
1,basically he is not only a good father but a mentally challenged man
1,the story and acting is very good
1,also there is a very good reason why it does so well
1,overall a movie which will keep you guessing
1,i think the movie is really good and is worth seeing
1,it 's a very good movie
1,perhaps the most important thing is it 's a
1,apparently the movie is about two men that have been in their own right together and then get involved in a strange situation
1,but i was so glad that i did n't have a chance to see another movie that i would have seen so far
1,and then it 's not just a matter of
1,so i have to say i was really
1,the film has an interesting message
1,and if you want to see it
1,from the first scene the last two is the first one to get the feeling of being an extra star
1,those two characters have an unresolved chemistry with one 's father but the story itself is just a little
1,this was the first movie i had
1,there was no real plot and the plot was just too stupid
1,lest anyone think this was the best movie ever and it was a great
1,the acting is so bad the dialog are so bad that it 's not funny
1,the film was shot in a time where a camera is not used to make it look lifelike but it is not that
1,i was so annoyed by the story that i
1,then i went and bought this dvd and i
1,revert back from one scene of another of the most famous actors i ever saw
1,there is a bit of a plot that could have
1,the movie does n't have to have any real plot
1,cat has a heart that is so stupid so stupid and
1,i think it 's a very good movie for a good laugh out loud
1,the acting is so bad that it 's not really bad but it 's not bad
1,the film is a very interesting and interesting story of
1,but if this is n't a bad movie it
1,perhaps it 's too bad that they have to go into the script because of the lack of logic
1,i am not kidding this movie was made for the
1,i would not have had the chance to watch this movie again
1,therefore he gets to know what the characters are
1,hence the story of this movie and i think it is n't a bad one
1,i have n't been a horror fan and i 've seen it many times
1,my rating 12 out it is not so much a film as it is about the same subject that is a
1,the film does n't have any redeeming features
1,it is the story and acting that makes this film so special
1,i was so excited about the whole thing i was n't bored and did n't even notice the plot
1,i was so disappointed by this movie
1,i do remember the first time you see that scene and
1,so why is this so bad that
1,and the whole cast did well
1,there 's a lot of action and suspense to it
1,the script was good and the acting superb
1,and if i 'd been a fan like i would
1,as with most of these films it 's a very simple and very well done film
1,to the end you 'll be wondering what is the motivation
1,the first thing we know are the good guys who
1,other than that i would have to
1,which is an understatement since the movie does n't have much to
1,there are many things wrong in this movie that are all over the place
1,i have to say that i love the show
1,they are both the only characters who could have used to be more interesting
1,i was n't really sure what to expect from the film but i did not
1,do n't be put off by the film it does contain a bit too little plot and a
1,maybe he was trying to be too serious and
1,i 've never heard of this film until now
1,and it 's the only thing to make it
1,pino donaggio 's novel was based upon the novel by the same
1,it is a very funny and funny show
1,decadence of death is the most important thing in the film
1,its not a great movie to begin with
1,the script for a very interesting twist is a little bit more interesting than most movies of
1,the only way i got this movie was that i could not even get a grip of what the film is trying to convey
1,the film is a bit long and the story is n't as compelling
1,i 've been wanting my share of movies from a similar director to his films but this film is just another way to get a recommendation
1,i was n't surprised that this film did have a few moments that i thought was funny
1,apparently the writers and writers decided that this movie needed to do something more
1,for me the best aspect about the story is the fact
1,if you do n't get to see this movie it 's a waste of money
1,he has a nice idea of what
1,if you do not have a clue and are looking for a better movie in the same
1,the story line was n't too bad
1,the acting is superb as well
1,maureen o'hara is a great actress who
1,i was very impressed with the casting of robert duvall as the lead
1,gray and delilah are the best and they are n't just caricatures of the men
1,a great movie for everyone and i think it is a very enjoyable family
1,when they were on vacation they were n't even the
1,solely the scene in which one woman has a crush on her and he is a victim
1,radu was a very good actor for his part and the character was very believable
1,although some of us may like it it 's still fun to watch it 's good to laugh at and i laughed
1,i 've been a fan of many movies but this one is a must for all
1,this was a great series of movies
1,part 2 i 've always liked the movie
1,helena bonhamcarter is perfect in the role
1,you could n't believe how it was all about the world war 2
1,i think this movie is worth seeing as much as it is
1,these two characters are very well done
1,a very good movie that is definitely not worth the money or a rental for
1,john ritter 's character does n't seem to be in the movie so he
1,fear is the only thing in the movie that has the decency of being a real good movie with a good story but i think it 's just not worth it
1,all in all this is a fun film to watch for anyone who wants good entertainment
1,his acting is a bit stilted and the story
1,his father is so much more in it than he is
1,the script is pretty much a mixture
1,clever and entertaining this film is a perfect example of a film that
1,i was so disappointed with it that i could
1,highly enjoyable but not as good as the original
1,this is a movie to watch and you should not
1,they did n't know where i was
1,it 's the kind one thing that is a good reason to watch
1,not only did he have the same sense of the
1,he was also a big star and a really good guy in his early 20s and the movie shows his talent for playing the role
1,this movie has a lot to do but i really enjoyed
1,it 's the story that is so
1,this film is a total disaster from start to end the whole thing is a mess and one that is very poorly directed
1,i am surprised it got released and the film 's only saving grace to me is the fact of
1,i would not recommend this movie if it were not so bad that i was expecting something like it would make me
1,the film does n't really go anywhere but is a good movie to watch
1,also the story is just about the most interesting
1,when he finally gets a job he goes to the police station with a woman who
1,this is one of the worst i 've heard i 've
1,not to say that it was a little more interesting to be the more serious of all this movie but it 's not as
1,i saw some people being treated to the movie and the acting by the director is
1,being the first of the many movies i saw i was looking forward into the
1,this was an attempt to make a sequel to a remake of star trek franchise
1,fortunately the film does n't do anything for it
1,for me it is very funny but also very very sad that there is a bit more of it
1,listen to it like a documentary about a boy 's journey
1,i was a young teenager and i thought it 's pretty
1,looking at this movie i was n't impressed
1,he was n't so bad that they were so horrible it 's almost like a
1,later they are all in trouble
1,i have seen many people who 've commented about this movie but the story has no plot
1,however this is a film that is just so awful that i do n't even care if anyone else has ever done this
1,the only reason why the movie was so long was its lack
1,lucky i had no luck but this movie has been a lot better
1,it seems like the actors were having fun making this one a big hit for the big fan who had a great laugh
1,goku 's mother has a son who has n't even been a child and he believes that
1,i have n't seen the original and i think that the film will
1,no one would be interested with a movie that was a
1,there is a lot to be learned
1,fleming 's direction seems rather forced in the way
1,an interesting premise that is n't entirely wasted here
1,notice that the characters are a little more interesting and you feel their pain
1,and it was not that good to make
1,so it is the story and character that makes a good film
1,i was so excited that i had spent so much money
1,some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that does make the film unwatchable
1,dunaway and her brother were also very good
1,i was really looking at this movie and found myself enjoying it
1,its not bad not the acting the special fx are bad the effects are horrible and so is that it is bad
1,this movie had to go with me
1,to be more realistic i was a bit confused that i was n't a fan like myself
1,the plot is so predictable the characters are stupid the
1,we see it as a family film but not as a drama or an adult comedy
1,the film starts out like the movie
1,roundtree 's character is a total jerk
1,he was not even the best actor of
1,the movie itself has been a staple in my life for a long time but in the meantime of the film there were some things wrong
1,he does n't really care about what he is
1,why the heck did the writers make the first two episodes of this series
1,my favorite parts of a movie were the ones that made
1,i do n't think the director was able to
1,daughter is in the hospital and decides that he
1,my advice is that it is a waste of a
1,i do n't care if the film was intended as a drama it was a parody of the original
1,in one scene a man who has his head chopped out the other night in a field
1,i was surprised to find myself in a few situations that could have done a better movie in this regard but the movie is n't even a
1,all the way through this film i did n't want a movie
1,i am a huge fan of this genre and have never seen such a big success
1,for some of the characters the film is a lot like the first and only in the last fifteen years or
1,it is a shame that this film is not available in theatres
1,a great show that will appeal in many ways
1,the film is a very interesting and interesting film with a few twists
1,take it with the grain and enjoy it
1,something to be done but it is n't a movie to me
1,besides the fact that this film is a complete
1,they are n't in it and they do n't even
1,the story is not very interesting and it does n't even have to be
1,most of the actors in this are very good especially linus and the guy who are
1,i would like to see it released in a very high class
1,i was expecting this movie from the local cable library to watch it but i never really wanted to watch it again
1,i do have a good reason but the only way this show
1,how could you not love the movie as much if it 's all over
1,another thing i found most enjoyable in my youth
1,a very good film that will make you think about life and love
1,i was so impressed by the fact i was watching it for the first time in years i was amazed by the end
1,i 've heard this movie was a bad one because it
1,unfortunately the script is so bad and poorly written that i do feel sorry to have
1,where is a girl who looks like a
1,most films that i have n't seen in my life were so bad
1,but it really is n't a movie i would say to you
1,these guys are all on the verge of becoming the next target and they must
1,don bluth was not a bad actor
1,it is a good movie to make you laugh
1,there is also the possibility of a young woman to be found guilty of being a
1,it was the most difficult and most of my favorites in the film
1,the acting was so bad it was almost comical to me but the film itself was not a great film
1,ray liotta is a very convincing actor but the film is n't very well received and it 's not worth mentioning
1,leader is just one of the best actors in the movie
1,typically this film is a waste of time and time and money
1,the film is a complete waste of a
1,to say the least is the only movie that i will rate this one
1,and that is the reason i love the film and why
1,depending on your money for this one
1,she is a beautiful woman who has been sent to a small village by
1,well the movie is not about a single woman who is
1,amid a few moments of dialog that is not as good it 's not as bad as the others in the movie
1,you 'll find yourself wondering how the writers were able at the end
1,i was expecting more of the same from my friend
1,what 's the difference between this movie
1,it 's also a movie about a family being attacked and
1,i was so bored i did not watch it again in a
1,leo mccarey has an excellent performance as the villain of the new orleans family
1,despite all these flaws that the movie was supposed to be about an interesting subject i found it very enjoyable to sit through and kept you thinking
1,although the characters are not the least developed
1,and if you 're looking at this film and have a
1,i am still watching this film
1,one of the best of this era is when the character played a part that was the best actor in the movie and
1,one of them is one of the most annoying character of the movie
1,go see the movie for a laugh
1,it 's a pretty lame story and is not the best way for me to enjoy
1,the script is so bad that it becomes annoying
1,only to find some kind to the characters and the actors
1,rita hayworth is excellent as well as the young
1,he 's got a bad accent and a guy who 's supposed
1,this movie is a masterpiece of the first
1,sure there is a lot of bad things about how this movie
1,unfortunately the movie fails miserably at its core and the film is just not worth seeing in the context of the story
1,with a lot of action sequences and an excellent cast and the end
1,now i'm not sure what to say but i 'll be a fan
1,this film is a waste of your time
1,as i said the movie was a waste of my faves
1,cheesy acting and poor special affects are the ones who do arouse their brains
1,all in one sitting at home at walmart
1,each character is played by a different director who is n't the only person
1,as the movie progresses he 's a bit more interesting than he is
1,the only good thing about this movie is the ending
1,this is not a movie for anyone who has ever seen it but it will leave it with you
1,basically this is a great movie
1,warning the film 's only problem is that you know you 're in for a rough ride
1,much more so in this case
1,he does a fine job and his voice is so powerful
1,sadly the film has been cut from the bottom ten to 10 to ten seconds
1,but the movie was not a great comedy and i was disappointed that
1,she has a beautiful and sexy face she is so funny she 's not just funny in this movie
1,the film was shot in the seventies in the early 90
1,the acting by some of the best actors out of all
1,the first part is about two girls in paris and a couple of them
1,i have never been more disappointed to see
1,in fact i 've always loved it in many areas but i still ca ca n't remember
1,the film is not about the battle between the two brothers but it
1,a lot more than just a few scenes i have to say i was n't a fan that was the
1,what a waste of a perfectly talented cast
1,he was not only the last of three films
1,other then that i do n't think the acting was a bit over looked and the story is just not very good at all and the story line seems rather forced
1,there 's a very interesting moment of humor in the film and it is the most powerful scene in the film
1,the film opens at a snail point
1,duh i 'll give the filmmakers credit on the film
1,this is one of those films where
1,meanwhile the police force up the local cop and he becomes involved in the investigation
1,the acting in this movie was terrible
1,we do n't know how it would end
1,the plot has a lot going for it
1,they 're all the same and the same is a true reason
1,it 's a pity he does not
1,punch up is one that i think of that
1,during this period of course he 's given the
1,one can only hope that some people have done that with this movie
1,hmmm this is a great film
1,this was a waste of a movie
1,the story is about a group that is attacked by a mysterious
1,it is an extremely difficult movie to sit through as it is a very interesting and
1,of course that 's why the characters do n't get any depth
1,naturally it 's hard not only to confuse them but also to be a very good person
1,an interesting story told the director of this
1,a film of note that is n't the best of the bunch but the
1,there is some good cinematography in the picture and the cinematography but
1,i 've just wasted a couple of days and a half hour
1,how did i get this movie in dvd and the dvd cover
1,the movie is very much a documentary about a man trying to
1,and if you want it be a good film to have a little of the time it 's
1,as the movie goes around the movie does n't seem as though he 's in a hurry to get a sense of the danger to his own
1,but it 's a very good movie
1,at this stage it appears to me as though they 've been on the verge to make a movie that was
1,the film starts with three women trying to escape from
1,like the other movies i saw this one the only redeeming factor
1,the acting is superb and the writing is flawless and there are a few twists but overall this show is n't
1,even though the movie is not really an oscar winner it 's not really an attempt by the director and the actors are not even close up
1,it 's a pretty good movie if the movie does a bit of
1,it 's a pity that the film never got released because the film is
1,i was n't impressed to watch it because i was not disappointed
1,another reason why i think that it 's a movie for kids is because you do n't get that
1,she is a good actress in her role but she 's not the best actor of this generation and that is
1,he does a lot for his family and his son 's father
1,the script is pretty much the same as it is with the
1,the plot was simple but the movie is not just an action film but a comedy with lots and good
1,he has no clue of his own life
1,despite the fact that she has a very strong character
1,then i saw the movie and was expecting a lot more
1,it 's a good example of how
1,if you like good acting and you are a big bad movie go rent it
1,his performance was very good and the film also shows the true friendship between
1,mr moto and his wife are both in their early 30s and have become a bit of a geena davis
1,michel legrand is one of the best actors in the world
1,ellen 's sister 's life is so easy you 're wondering why you should care about her
1,not the best of the bunch of shorts
1,to me it seemed that the movie would be
1,the acting was good too although i was not
1,jack lemmon was a great actor
1,snacks to the devil and i was so angry
1,and the movie is a little bit confusing
1,why is there no explanation of how to
1,we have to watch more than once but this one is the most
1,was he trying too many to imitate the film
1,what is it about the subject matter that makes this film so unique that the viewer is not aware to them
1,of the 90 's the movie was shot by the same guy but it looks more so much different than what you 'd imagine
1,cohen 's film is a very funny film
1,nearly every character was played and the characters did n't
1,when the young man is murdered by an old lady and he
1,and i did not even think of any other actors
1,but it is a good movie that has some good points in it
1,this movie has a good cast with it 's a good name to start
1,gene hackman is an actor who does not
1,too bad they did not even have the original
1,do n't bother with this one if you want to see something really
1,not to say the movie has any redeeming
1,blinding the movie is a waste your money
1,despite the fact this is a great movie it 's a real shame because it
1,the film is a real classic
1,in this movie we see the first three members and their
1,valeria is a beautiful woman that is in her own
1,this is a movie that should n't even be made
1,the film has been done well with the acting and directing
1,yet they 're just so stupid and stupid
1,american graffiti was a great film for those who enjoy watching and all
1,the plot of this film has to be the worst i have seen in
1,basically the story is pretty simple and there
1,heres a movie that is not worth renting and if you
1,the film was made for a rainy budget and i was able in
1,i saw the unrated version with an open mind of my friends and i had to watch this movie over
1,apparently the filmmakers had no knowledge about the subject but it was a little different from the
1,such as the scene where the boys try
1,that is why i love movies about them and
1,the first movie was a bit slow but it was just fun to watch
1,typically i have not seen the film
1,yoda is a man living and dies in a small secluded town in the early 20th century
1,it 's like an episode to a real world of the twilight zone
1,is it any wonder that this one was the
1,i am not even trying hard
1,tidbit there is a scene of an elderly
1,a young girl who is married to a woman
1,then there 's a bit of a plot
1,who 's trying to say it
1,nick is a great actor with some good lines but it 's not enough to save the movie from getting
1,you know what 's happening and you 'll know why he has
1,someone who thinks that this is a real masterpiece
1,but the rest are just as dull
1,the only reason that i had never heard about it is that the director was a fan that the whole thing is so bad it 's good
1,my favorite character in this show has to be the head of the father of the father
1,what makes this film stand is that it does n't
1,the only good parts were the special
1,so much for the movie it was the first film i 've ever watched and i would have to agree with the previous comments
1,the movie is a mess and a waste of film and time to be wasted in a film that should have been called
1,i am glad he did n't make
1,so what does he have to say about it
1,we 're not sure why it was so bad
1,the story itself is quite basic
1,sorry but i do n't think it 's a good film
1,this is not only the funniest horror film of
1,guy kibbee is also the only reason this film did so many of the songs
1,this movie is one of the best
1,i am surprised how many of the reviewers who rated this movie 10 out of 4 are so ignorant
1,there is n't a lot of action in the film
1,the story is not really bad enough but it 's not a good movie at all
1,i was n't impressed with the fact that this movie is n't really a comedy
1,in the end you will be happy
1,hank and his men are the only two characters in this movie that are n't very funny
1,he is a real artist and the rest are all very good
1,naturally the movie is a bit too long and is n't even a great one at that it 's very much the case for the movie that has n't been
1,the film also has a very nice soundtrack score
1,she does a pretty good acting in this film
1,not a great story but i think it is one of my personal favorite films and it is so much more than what you can find in an indie movie and not a great one at its best when the story is good
1,when a man 's mother has to do it he 's not the
1,but this is just not enough to save the movie
1,i'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece
1,the film was directed in a very very low budget and it is a pity to see the movie again for that
1,not that i do know that they do not have the best but
1,a few years later i was watching a tv show with a friend and a friend
1,elsewhere the movie starts out pretty much a flashback but the ending does n't seem
1,i would recommend it to the people that are fans and want to make an action
1,the plot was pretty good and the acting was good enough but the script could n't have been more
1,but it is not just a movie
1,but this was n't even the worst of it
1,the film is a bit of a bore
1,even a little bit of action is a tad
1,a very good film but i think it
1,it 's a movie that 's very funny and funny
1,i have been in many of those of the other movies and
1,the only thing that made me laugh was when this
1,the movie is a very good piece for me
1,but that 's all it is a
1,what a pity it is n't
1,the movie is about a young woman who has no idea who she is
1,not to be missed the first time around
1,the film is about a man whose
1,i 've seen better acting in better films but this one really stood out
1,rob schneider is great here in his role as a psychiatrist
1,the story is a bit confusing
1,the acting was terrible the script was so poor the dialogue made me angry and i
1,there are a few things that make the show fun
1,where is his car that 's all the money
1,but there 's a lot of things in this flick that are just plain silly
1,naturally a few people get killed and he gets shot in a tree
1,i was n't sure whether the film was intentionally shot but it
1,decided that the story was n't going to make sense to a man who could n't even be
1,and there was one great scene involving the girl and the baby with the car being chased by her
1,unfortunately the only time i felt was that of the film 's success was the fact that it
1,sci fi and the devil were all very funny at
1,the plot was so bad that even though the plot was n't a good one there is enough tension and it does n't really matter
1,sure this is a great story but i ca n't imagine it ever made
1,heroes of course are so stupid i could have done better
1,the film was a waste for the whole movie
1,and if i was n't so engrossed to see
1,i 've just finished watching it and i have to say i
1,this film is a great film for those who like romantic comedies
1,well the film was so good
1,some of it was shot in an old school with no lighting
1,the acting is n't too good
1,dont bother me if i were a fan of the original but i was n't impressed
1,the story was so bad it was funny
1,would you want to see this movie
1,movie starts off promising but the acting is n't bad and i think it
1,this is one of the worst tv shows i ever
1,i think the film was made at a
1,i have seen some bad movies in them but this was the worst
1,so i did have my dvr in the middle
1,the movie is also about how to make people who are in the
1,they all have a great cast
1,a very enjoyable and interesting movie
1,another one of those that is so good in this movie that it is hard to believe a lot in which the movie
1,it was a very nice surprise to see a movie like it
1,i am a fan and i was so
1,i would like to give this a 7 out of 10 but the acting the writing etc the story was good
1,the movie has an interesting premise that is
1,world politics are a little less believable than the
1,the film 's title character is a very nice film to see
1,so if you want a real treat and a great
1,how many times have we seen the movie before
1,judge of his death is one that should be seen with an audience like the ones that are supposed or the people who are the most ardent fan that 's ever going to have the opportunity to see a movie that does n't have a shred of reality and
1,nevertheless i would n't want to see a movie for it
1,memories are very common in this movie and there are no characters and the movie
1,this one has a very good story line
1,read the book for the film
1,this is not a film of all people and
1,bad guys are bad enough for this type of
1,she 's a very good character and the acting
1,the acting is good the story is good the actors and the actors do n't make much sense
1,bonnie is not the only good thing about this film it 's really just a bunch of people walking around
1,the plot is so predictable that it makes it impossible for any person to understand the plot and
1,but it is a movie to make it
1,however the film is a bit of an exercise on contemporary culture
1,other than that the story line is pretty weak and the movie never drags
1,with the help from their mother the local judge has no qualms that he would n't want them to go into the
1,i 've read some of my comments on this movie but the fact
1,hmm i guess this is one of those movies that is
1,i saw this movie and it was a great show
1,just like the other movies i had heard that i saw this movie
1,he is a very talented actor who is a talented actor
1,please i implore you to watch something
1,it would seem that a lot of things happen
1,even if the film is n't for you the film is not as bad in every way
1,i'm surprised how many of these movies have a plot that will make it a mustsee movie
1,others will be disappointed but the film does n't have to worry on a lot of the movie is shot in the background in the middle of an obvious day
1,it 's just that if it was that bad i think it would get worse
1,the plot is very simple and the characters are all believable
1,actually the only way i can see this
1,together the film is a bit too dark and the movie has a very very nice look
1,it is n't the worst film i have ever seen in fact it was worse the acting was worse than that of the rest
1,if you like it and you do the same with me then you will love this movie and you will
1,i was hoping to see the worst movie ever produced
1,the plot is about a group who are searching for a missing treasure
1,why did they need the money
1,yet i do not have the luxury to see it again and it 's still a great movie
1,he was so much of a jerk that i felt he
1,they 're the only one of them who 's in
1,if you 're an insomniac with the sense of heart you may find something else about yourself
1,also in the cast are charles durning john gielgud and william smith and you will have a fun time watching
1,and that is the only good aspect of this film
1,however i was not expecting anything else but
1,but i guess that 's a good thing since this movie is a waste of time
1,all in all i would like to see this movie again
1,while he 's the only person i have seen in his movies i have a feeling of admiration
1,it is a very interesting film and one that keeps it moving and very moving
1,but there are some good parts
1,this movie is so bad it 's laughable
1,they have an excellent cast and is a good family movie with a good story line
1,c'mon the acting in this movie is so good i have seen a few
1,sure i know that it has the
1,the film was shot on a very cheap digital budget and i would not be surprised to find that this movie is not as much like a film
1,the only thing i really enjoyed about this movie was the fact it seemed
1,there 's no real reason that the characters are
1,likewise the film is very boring with its clichd dialogue
1,you 're not a big part
1,directed by david cronenberg i am still very impressed with this
1,they were the only characters who had the decency of the first and last time
1,elizabeth is the one to watch in the movies
1,how do you have to have to have this movie
1,a good premise and great actors but the film does n't really have any real laughs or atmosphere and it does n't work
1,it is a movie about two men who fall for a young boy named sasha who has the power to
1,holly is a very strong character who is also quite good at playing
1,and that 's about where the similarities between these characters come from and the plot is so predictable that
1,4 the acting was horrible and the story is just plain silly
1,each and every one of these people has been so hateful that it seems to have no
1,you can see the whole thing
1,if there were some of the characters in the movie they were all very
1,i think the best scene is when she gets her head on
1,perhaps it 's because it 's a film about a bunch that can
1,ok so the film has some good points but the film is n't as good as in this one it 's just plain awful
1,its a film that you can find in the video stores and have a lot more fun with this one
1,it 's a pity the actors never made a film in this film as a director
1,not a film about a man in prison in a world who wants
1,do not read the book if you read the summary on the back of the box it is
1,what a waste for a razzie award
1,there was a lot to talk about and i loved the first two scenes
1,my advice if you are an aspiring horror fan who loves the film or even
1,you can get past his own personal problems and the way the story
1,rockin' the scene where one is supposed to be the next scene
1,you can see this movie and the fact it has a very very good cast and great actors
1,louis leung is a great actor in this movie and he does a wonderful job as always the tough one
1,i was very disappointed in how it came out of nowhere in
1,we all know that this show is just plain funny
1,i 've seen a lot of movies and this is
1,and i have to say that i do not recommend this movie to anyone
1,plus the fact that the movie does a great disservice in the end makes me think of the movie the only way you can enjoy this movie is how it was done
1,i was very impressed with this film and i do not know if i
1,saw this film at the amsterdam international movie fest festival and it was one of the worst of the early 70s
1,it is not the best film ever but
1,however this movie has some of the best actors of the careers and the best supporting cast is
1,horror movies were made on the big budgets
1,also the fact of the movie is a very
1,the script was very good and the acting and production quality were flawless and the actors
1,sandra bullock was the first of the three in the movie
1,this is a great film with some
1,this is a pretty decent movie
1,and i was so impressed by what the movie was going to be like
1,guess the real reason why i gave this film 1 out
1,dressed as a black man who has no problems with her being an actress in the first place she was the one who was the best actress in the whole film
1,now i am not a fan of any movie but the movie
1,the film was very well made
1,his performance was the best i 've seen him in
1,people who like a great movie do n't see it
1,full house is one of those films with an extremely high budget but the story is really bad
1,to say the movie has an interesting message is beyond
1,woodbury is a good actor and it 's hard to see how he could
1,but the film 's only flaw was its lack that the first time director did n't have any real agenda
1,i do agree with all the comments and the comments that the film is based in on it is based in my review of
1,compare to other films from these three the same year and the one
1,richard gere plays the role of john ford in a very understated and humorous performance as the head
1,on his way to the top of a cylinder and a young man he finds himself pursued into the sea of the dreaded
1,it is a movie with a strong message about the life
1,fonda and dunne are great as the couple and they 're able to pull off a believable and believable performance
1,however this one has been done before and i do n't want a refund in the story
1,the plot is a bit confusing but the ending is so satisfying i ca all of
1,i have seen many films that have a great story line and a lot of good acting but it 's
1,remember the name of the song
1,this film was made for kids and that is what they have
1,i think they would have given a better performance
1,you will be amazed and ashamed to say that
1,the only reason i watched it was because i was bored and i was not impressed with it as a kid
1,judy 's dad is a little suspicious in his role but in the end he does n't do
1,his acting skills were so bad that i could n't help thinking this movie was just a cheap
1,her performance was not bad but the whole thing was so terrible
1,some of my other faves are n't so bad it 's funny it
1,i 've watched the first two seasons of the series
1,very funny in parts and i thought that the ending could n't save the day
1,how about a movie with a plot
1,both are very different and they just do a very good job of portraying their love relationship in love
1,thirdly it 's a little too long but it
1,fave was the last of the series and is very much the most interesting and compelling movie i 've seen in years
1,i 've read many of the other reviews here and it shows
1,ian mcshane does an excellent job as always and the supporting cast is very good but in this movie it is a bit of a stretch
1,almost every character has a personality in which it 's so obvious they 're all going for a real treat
1,and there is nothing inherently funny about it and that 's about it and
1,it was n't a great film
1,the movie is n't so great as
1,it 's all about a bunch of friends who get together in front days of
1,there 's a lot going on here
1,the movie is a little slow but the acting and script are all excellent
1,episode 1 i was surprised to learn that the series was actually filmed in
1,tomato jawed is an awful show
1,we are told that it is a very good film to watch and is very entertaining and funny
1,blu cage 's role is a little too old for the part but the story was n't too
1,other than that it was n't a total waste
1,if you like this kind of thing i 'd recommend the movie for you
1,betsy milano and john cleese are great as are two words
1,films like this are the ones with the right balance of the two
1,all in the family is a very very interesting movie about a man who gets caught by
1,the film is about the adventures and the struggle to be taken with a real life
1,in addition there is a lot of things about a film that could be made in english as opposed in that it is the only one in which i have to watch with a little more of my
1,serbs and civilians are n't always the most popular people but they are not a lot of people
1,do n't get me wrong it 's a
1,embracing all that is done in the first place is just that great
1,and i was n't surprised by this film
1,the film has a lot to recommend it
1,dust the film as a whole
1,but it 's not the worst movie you 've seen since i 've seen this one in a few days
1,the only real highlight of it all
1,the plot is n't really a bit of one and the
1,as for the film it is not
1,first of course i do not want a lot to the movie
1,i think this is just an example of how a film should be released theatrically
1,now if you can appreciate the film 's shortcomings it 's a mustsee for the whole family that should
1,i saw that the film was shot in black
1,these two are a little less likable
1,this film is one of those movies that you could
1,the plot is a bit of a clich the ending was a little too slow
1,to be honest it 's not a film for children
1,right away the plot twists were a little weak but the acting was good enough
1,as for me i would n't have bothered with a good story and the movie just could n't get the better of that
1,but it 's just a bunch that is n't
1,the plot is a bit thin but the story is pretty decent
1,this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever and
1,the plot is a lot of people have killed the killer in a car crash and a group is left to be seen and the killer does n't even get to have any kind of character
1,to make matters even more interesting the director of the movie is the main protagonist
1,in fact i think it could have made a good film and a little bit more
1,george romero 's direction is the best i 've ever
1,the script is a complete mess
1,of course he 's not a bad guy but he is so bad that he ca n't save the film
1,the film is a little bit dated
1,with the first two actors in the cast the
1,nothing more to say the first hour
1,this movie has been on dvd so that the people who made this movie should have seen it
1,this is the kind of story which i would like it to have had
1,it was a great idea for a movie
1,anyway it is not a good movie
1,the script is a joke and the
1,and i do not understand why the film is so hard to find
1,it is one of the funniest i have seen for
1,sure he does n't have the same sense as a movie with a lot
1,the film was shot in a time square and in that it was a
1,the acting by all is terrible the plot and acting is poor and the writing is terrible
1,the film also suffers from a very poor script which fails to impress the intelligence of the
1,to be expected this is a great movie
1,overall this is a very good movie
1,all in there and i do n't see how this movie would ever be
1,as a result a lot happens in the first movie
1,i am a sucker for movies that are made with some
1,i think it 's a great movie
1,and the acting was so bad i had to leave the cinema with a smile of my eye
1,but it 's so good that you 're not really sure of the
1,the acting was pretty good but it did n't really work
1,they do not seem like a good old guy
1,an example of how the film 's director 's idea of making
1,think to myself i 've heard a
1,the script was so weak the characters were boring the story line is ridiculous and the
1,wanting the audience to enjoy this movie
1,i saw that the actors were trying to be very hard and i think they were trying to act as if it was a real movie
1,first it is a story of a boy who is trying to solve his crimes to solve
1,of course it 's a film about how it is in
1,when it is n't that he 's been doing his work in
1,yes the characters are not the same
1,which brings us the other side that we
1,i 've seen many movies where i have to say i have a problem with the movie that 's it 's not bad and
1,he 's a good actor and i can only
1,that is the best thing about this movie
1,i think that i would have to disagree with the above
1,ivanhoe was the most expensive version of the movie
1,even the actors do an ok job
1,in my mind it is the best of his career and one of my favorites
1,william shatner is perfect in his role and it 's the only thing that is n't bad
1,imperium is a very very talented director and director has a few ideas in his film that is n't
1,now that i have read this i am a big fan of
1,exciting to see how they could have had it all done
1,it is not a bad film it is very good and the film has some nice moments to it
1,too many of the actors and crew of the time
1,although the film had a lot of fun the plot twists were well done and the characters were all well
1,it has been said for some other
1,unfortunately the director does have a good time
1,it 's the kind of thing that makes
1,matlin 's character was very interesting in a few scenes
1,considering the budget the film has a very low budget and some very good actors
1,folks it 's a good show but it
1,i 've been searching the following years for my own
1,this is a film which is not a typical one but is an enjoyable little movie
1,our hero and his wife have a conversation with him but
1,whenever the show is over we see them coming up
1,a good premise and good performances
1,as a fan i have a feeling that the film was made by the
1,good acting bad directing and an overall score
1,if i had the chance to see a screener of this movie i
1,i 've never watched such an amazing performance
1,the acting is n't all bad
1,shot in a very beautiful setting this film is one that should never have been called upon the academy award for the film
1,ah that 's all i can think of
1,the film is about three sisters who are searching at a party for their lives
1,dragons was a great film and i was surprised at how
1,all in the family was a great film
1,her character has an insatiable attraction to her and her character has
1,in fact this is a good movie that you would want to
1,but i did like the movie as a whole
1,the story of the first film is about the family of a group called the filthiest of them and their
1,but if you want a fun and exciting film watch the first film and you will be disappointed in the least enjoyable and entertaining action movie ever seen
1,the film has a lot of action scenes and is really a very entertaining movie
1,the acting is good and the story is a little too predictable for my tastes and that 's a shame
1,robertson is the most annoying person you have ever seen
1,it 's not a movie that is supposed to have a profound feel for a horror movie
1,you 'll find a good idea of what to do
1,bakshi 's version is a great snapshot on the human psyche but that 's not the point
1,as far as the film goes it is not very bad
1,in fact i thought the film would have been better
1,this film is one that should be required viewing in
1,however i found it very entertaining and the performances by the actors were great too
1,the only reason i can find this is due to a few complaints about it but i can say
1,it 's the same story as the first one and it 's not that bad
1,is it really that difficult to make it
1,thanks the cast in this movie and the cast
1,this movie is a very entertaining movie for a rainy day to come
1,and then there is the plot twist
1,some people have said the acting is awful but the story line is n't really good
1,i 've seen this movie countless times and have always loved the
1,mathieu is a very funny film about how the world is going to become the devil
1,actually if you are a fan or the person who does you 're in for the hell out of the film and you
1,i was n't really interested when they said the film is a bit boring
1,but then again this is one of those rare movies where
1,it 's a movie where the action takes
1,but it 's a great film with a few twists and some interesting moments that keep you
1,he was n't so much an actor but he was just as good as
1,also the movie is pretty much the exact same thing with the same plot
1,i have been watching this movie several times and i can tell you it was not the worst movie
1,lee is one of my favorite actors he was the best actor
1,what the hell happened with the movie
1,the movie is very good for a rainy saturday
1,such a pity that they could n't make such crap
1,this movie should have been called a warning on a friday night
1,the first half of this series had a good storyline and a nice cast
1,well i was n't going for much but the fact that i saw it on dvd i had never seen
1,he has been in the spotlight for a long time
1,perhaps the only redeeming thing about the entire show
1,now the film is a good one to say that is not the best movie i have ever
1,its a shame that this series has n't received a higher score because its not only for the fact they are the most popular
1,it was a complete waste of the movie
1,the film has its charms but it has to overcome its weaknesses
1,sure i know the story but this is not the one
1,the only thing i have seen in this movie is that it makes me want more
1,the first half is a great show and one thing that
1,i am glad i watched this movie
1,ah the music score is very good and the cinematography of the story is excellent but the story and acting are not
1,though he did n't do the movie he was n't
1,a great story line and a great story line to
1,whatever the problem is they are n't going to be so much better but it 's really
1,what is a great deal to say is this
1,but that aside the movie was just a lot better
1,the movie is also an exercise between both men and men and women as well
1,it 's a real shame that i did find that it did n't have a lot of potential for its parts and it was a
1,i think that this film is worth the money
1,how the heck did he manage to keep the
1,otherwise i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys watching a lot more of the film
1,sean connery is a great actor but the film
1,i saw the trailer the other day in the theater and found myself stunned by the film
1,i would n't have liked it
1,of course the main reason why this movie is n't in it is the way it 's presented and it does n't work out
1,the movie is a very funny satire of a very young woman
1,raul stamp is a very strong character and is
1,this is the most beautiful film in my collection of
1,but this does n't really mean it is n't a bad film at any rate it was a waste of your
1,here 's a good movie to watch for
1,it 's an amazing film but i doubt it will be
1,but if you can find this movie
1,instead he 's a bit of a jerk
1,for the first time i was very bored at the time
1,in fact it is a very poor film that
1,for the most part the acting of everyone involved is excellent
1,i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie is not a comedy
1,joel mccrea is a good actor
1,bernard 's character and the film has been released
1,neither the characters nor the characters and i ca least understand why it 's all so bad
1,but the story is very good too
1,central characters were all the same but i was very happy with this movie
1,the plot has some very good twists and it is
1,barbara stanwyck plays her role as her mother in a film that is more of an important character than
1,however i do have an opinion
1,nurse snowblood is the perfect film to be viewed as a classic of mine
1,for the sake of the story it might be the best thing i 've seen
1,do not waste money or money on this film
1,but the movie is a little bit too dark for its age as the film is
1,seagal gives a good performance as the head who is the
1,not to be missed for this type movie
1,the film has no plot at the beginning of the film
1,the acting is good and i thought the whole thing was
1,because there are two movies in the world that are not only bad it does not deserve to win awards or awards
1,and then they all go off in the desert
1,we 're supposed to sympathize with him
1,i was very surprised by his performance of him in
1,nothing else to say about this movie
1,rob lowe plays a young man whose father who is so obsessed with marrying her in his
1,i 've seen the other films that are n't so bad as to be bad
1,one of the greatest movies ever
1,and the fact is they 're not in
1,i was surprised by the amount of the film
1,i have seen it over 50 years
1,i have to admit i have seen this
1,this movie is a great example of what to call
1,info spoilers spoilers the movie was so predictable i was so confused that there were no redeeming feature at the end
1,it 's a good movie that has a nice ending
1,a great cast for a great cast including the late kirsten blanchett who plays the lead and the movie as the
1,but the plot does n't really go
1,it 's an enjoyable little film with a lot of good actors
1,and the fact of the movie is that it is not the best movie it is in my book
1,dylan 's performance is a bit over the heads but he has no problem suspending all those characteristics
1,a few of these scenes in which you see him perform the same thing over and over again and the fact that it is n't even a comedy is what the movie has
1,most of the actors were n't very funny and the
1,this movie has a few flaws
1,we see the same old stuff
1,so why does the main character have to deal around him
1,good job to the day and to watch
1,maybe the best thing about this film are the actors and a script
1,there were some interesting moments but i did n't get this as i found myself wanting more
1,the plot is very good and there 's some good acting
1,but it is still pretty bad and the acting is horrible from beginning too
1,paul naschy as the hero is a bit of an eccentric jerk
1,not the worst movie of the year
1,however as a result of what happens after the first hour the film loses steam to its
1,this time around the only time to come close to it is
1,this is an excellent documentary that is
1,this show was a waste of time for all
1,the script is n't that great but there are some great scenes that makes the movie worth watching
1,this is a very very boring film
1,i was hoping the movie will be a big improvement for me
1,but i did n't care for it
1,this is one movie you 'll love
1,it 's like they 're trying too hard
1,he 's not a good actress
1,as an example of what a good film can be for anyone who does not have
1,the movie is a little boring
1,the movie also is a very interesting portrayal that is in some ways a real good film with a very touching ending but in that regard it is a great film to watch
1,dvd version of this film was originally edited on video
1,90 years ago i 've watched several of the
1,i would n't have to go through
1,kline plays an american who is a man and a coward who is not a
1,another thing is that i did enjoy this film
1,he 's a real person to have to endure his own personal problems
1,there was one scene where the two boys were walking in a bar and had the conversation
1,still the whole cast was fine and the plot had potential
1,one of his best roles ever
1,in fact the film is just plain awful
1,he is a very very human man in the movie business
1,frankenstein does not have to be as good either as his first film or even the original
1,an insult for the viewer who will probably be the
1,as a matter of fact i was bored
1,sean connery is a great actor but the rest is a dud
1,in the book a man is told about a man named kurtz who has been in jail for a long time
1,and then there are some other scenes that
1,let us be said we have to be the most important thing you
1,then we are supposed for an intimate film
1,my favorite scene is where he gets a car driving and a car drives down into a warehouse
1,i was surprised to see this movie
1,i'm glad to see that this one
1,a great movie to show to your friends who are willing
1,growing on this movie and its story the acting is very good and very convincing
1,so why does n't they have the decency to make it into an
1,there 's an interesting plot involving a bunch of teens who are n't going through the same
1,to the devil 's mind it was not a
1,i do n't know about this movie and it 's probably one hell of a success
1,this is n't a good movie but is definitely a movie
1,as a result in that it is a film to make you think
1,the acting was terrible the dialogue was pathetic and the dialogue was bad in places
1,but the film 's only saving is its lack of any redeeming quality
1,at first i was n't really expecting a lot of it and
1,played by the great leslie williams as the title character he gives a great performance
1,it is n't even a comedy
1,my only question was what did they do in the first few seasons
1,i have never seen a movie that is so utterly devoid of any merit in its presentation
1,since i have never seen it i ca n't even compare it to my favorite tv series of course it was the first time
1,maltin said this is a bad film
1,one thing that was n't good was how a movie like a car accident
1,do n't bother with this one
1,specially when the movie is about to
1,i was very surprised when i saw this movie on tv and was impressed by the way it ended
1,i do think this was the best
1,timothy dalton is the most beautiful person in this movie
1,consolation on the movie that it 's not worth watching in any case
1,that 's all i can say
1,the story revolves around the adventures of
1,ok it was the best movie ever made
1,the movie is a very interesting one that is a good example of how many
1,the acting is superb and this is a film that can be seen in the same frame
1,any movie that makes me think that the movie was so bad it 's funny to me
1,while it is not the case that the film does deliver in the end
1,is there some sort a movie like
1,amy adams was also excellent in her portrayal of her character
1,instead it just seems to have a very very low key in it
1,as i was the whole movie i felt like a movie
1,not only is she not a good
1,why is he so obsessed with his life
1,i think this is why the creators decided to make a documentary about people who are the ones who have been
1,i 've always been one of many people who actually
1,but it is very entertaining in a sense that this movie was a waste of my
1,i have n't seen this movie so i can see a
1,roger corman is a master in this mess
1,at the end i was shocked
1,i think it 's unfair for the people who have read the books to see that this
1,but i would like to see that the filmmakers of this film have a very small budget
1,i 've seen this film twice so i cannot
1,from the opening scene where the hero 's mother is murdered by a werewolf and the two men are
1,first of all the movie is a mess
1,nothing new here is the story which does n't seem to be
1,but the film is a bit slow but not for the faint of heart
1,if you do see it you might have seen it on tv
1,hmm there is a scene where they have to fight a bit of a couple of the main characters are
1,it seems as though the director wanted her to make something out alive and
1,not the worst i 've ever seen
1,i would give it a zero out on a
1,the story line was a bit farfetched but it did make sense to me
1,it is not as much of a mystery but i think it is the only
1,however the story is not as complex as the others but the acting by everyone is good
1,the first time we saw her she is the perfect girl in a film of sorts
1,i saw this when it first broadcast on tv in the first place i was a little confused and it 's
1,had he not read any other reviews here he might be able to handle his character 's own
1,the script is very clever and the characters in the cast
1,i 've never seen a movie like this in the us i cried so bad at the first hour
1,the story is about a woman in a hospital that is played by a young woman in an attempt
1,his role is one of the most memorable i 've
1,he has a few funny moments
1,it seems to me as if it were a parody but the actors are n't really the good guys the
1,as for the rest of the film the acting was terrible
1,i have a lot going on with
1,what 's the point in that scene
1,we are left with this question that there is a plot behind the movie
1,i do not know how this movie is going to be so awful it has a good rating
1,henry fonda plays the role that he has been given in the first film as he 's not in this one and he is a good actor
1,i do believe that they could n't have made a movie like
1,painful to watch but it 's a fun movie to view for its honesty
1,fun in a good way to the point you are wondering about whether you like it or
1,this is the worst movie ever i have seen
1,in this movie it is n't as bad
1,less than just the old west and a little bit more of a story it is still a fun movie to see
1,and then there 's that in my heart
1,they were not so bad and i was expecting that
1,the film opens with some very strong images and then it is revealed about what is happening in the film
1,and if that 's what you 're looking at you do n't know what you should like
1,the film is an adaptation and the actors try their luck with their
1,i have to say i was a bit skeptical about the movie and the acting was pretty good
1,if it was n't so bad they were n't enough and it was not
1,the film is a good example to
1,then the plot begins to go downhill and i think this could have done without
1,this is a good movie for you
1,lots to tell about the dangers of love in the end
1,really the film is an exercise in
1,apparently the movie makers were not aware of the movie but the plot is not bad
1,at the very least the story is n't about the war
1,i was really expecting to get more from it than any
1,good acting and bad acting is the only thing this movie could do but the story just
1,fans will enjoy this film and will probably be entertained by the fact i have been watching many of the other reviewers on imdb
1,the movie has a very good plot
1,of course that 's why it has a few more flaws in it
1,when i saw him in the early 70s i had a good sense of humor
1,sure i know this film was a little bit too much for me but it is not so great
1,so it is not the story that is so bad it
1,if i had the chance i 'd watch a few minutes later that might be a good movie
1,i would recommend it to anyone
1,i saw this movie in the theatre and it was very good and it 's one i love
1,being a huge fan of his work this film was quite different from his usual efforts
1,i'm not a big big fan i have no idea what i was getting into but when it was n't all
1,moreover the story is a little too long to be interesting to the viewers and it really
1,in this movie the main character is the father
1,although this is a film it does n't need to be the least of the genre
1,our hero is a cop who wants a woman to go on a killing mission for his family
1,having the most ardent movie goers i have seen this movie and the acting is great the story is good the acting well done
1,so many of these films made me wonder if the actors were really
1,even the music is a little repetitive too
1,this is a movie that should be seen and appreciated to anyone with a taste of humor but not as
1,it is a very moving movie that i
1,some parts are a bit cheesy
1,deranged and dumber and the film has more of the same plot a little different characters
1,after all that i am a fan who is a little generous and i love to
1,half the time i was watching it with a little more substance and the humor was more of a shock and more serious
1,i think i would be very interested in reading
1,hell i did n't care about the movie 's characters but
1,there are some good things about this movie the acting is great it is a film that should never be
1,its a shame that they did n't make a lot more screen work and a lot of money went into making the movie
1,it 's not even that bad
1,i think i 've heard the name of the movie a million
1,did n't they even have a chance for this to come out of the closet
