0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be

0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,right off the bat the manhattan 's
0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many
0,no matter how sincere the appeal of life is can we say intrinsically good cowboys wonder whether in the end

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put
0,and she ca n't go i confess but drake was a thoroughly enjoyable police

0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere
0,the plot is topnotch in action scenes and setting up the atmosphere beyond more dull
0,he decides to steal a pot from his girlfriend lord
0,watch holmes oh owe such unfathomably hard

0,with pablo von sydow 's leonardo montana in the role this is a biography of an
0,blake kaufman had the use of verbatim faces in viewers so amazing moments
0,keeps himself on the sidelines for having intimate feelings
1,also i think that the director was a little too preoccupied with this movie
1,it 's a very funny film
1,after a few years i have seen this movie
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,days later i was able to find the movie and it was so bad that it would be a waste of time and money
1,so i was expecting something more
1,and it is not a movie that is n't
1,they are all very good actors
1,i'm not sure why this movie is not a movie for me
1,some people say that the film is a little bit of an exercise in a
1,i have seen the movie twice and it is one of the best i
1,douglas is a good actor but his performance in the film was not bad
1,sadly it 's not the same as the one in the book but the fact is it
1,just like the first movie the acting is pretty bad
1,this is a very good movie
1,the film has some of its moments that make it a classic
1,john goodman 's performance as a cop in a film made me laugh
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,says the movie was a bit too long for the first half of it but the
1,i'm a fan of the original series but this one is so
1,this movie was so bad it 's
1,the movie is about the power of the characters
1,it 's a very funny film and a great movie
1,the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who has a
1,jamie kennedy is a good actor but he is not convincing
1,good luck to the director and director
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen as one or two films
1,but the movie is a bit slow
1,more than anything i would say that this is a very good
1,i was n't expecting much from the film
1,until i was in a theater of the 80 's i was n't impressed
1,i was n't expecting much from this
1,in fact the only reason why this film is so good is because it is so much more
1,very few films are available in the us
1,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,can you say that this movie was
1,for a film about a young woman she 's not the least of the problems
1,when i saw the movie on tv it was a complete disappointment
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,unfortunately the movie does n't have a lot to do with it 's plot
1,score 4 stars for this movie
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,while i was n't impressed with the film it 's still very good
1,this movie was a waste for the first two hours
1,and the ending was a little unsatisfying and the movie was n't really that good
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,there are some good moments in the film
1,in fact it 's a shame that the movie has been so much better
1,then the movie starts with a bang and a couple of scenes that are just plain funny and i
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,indeed the film has some very funny scenes
1,at least the film was n't so good it 's good
1,dressler 's performance is the only reason
1,even though it is not a movie it 's a complete mess of a movie that is n't worth the
1,i have seen this film several years ago and it 's still a good
1,i was n't impressed by this film
1,creepshow 2 is one that is a must for fans of the original
1,that is the only thing i did not get
1,for the most part the acting was pretty bad and i did not care about any character
1,this is the first movie i 've
1,i have seen this movie several years ago and it is still
1,uma kristofferson plays a very good character and is very believable
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,i'm a fan of this film
1,but it 's not a bad movie
1,i have seen the movie and it is a very good film
1,instead it 's just another boring and pointless attempt at humor and fails to make sense to me at all
1,c thomas is a great movie
1,it is not the best film i 've seen but i 've never seen it
1,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,indeed it 's a good film
1,overall this movie was a waste
1,even though the movie is a bit long and boring
1,they are all very funny and the story is so funny
1,even the most diehard fans of the original series are n't very happy
1,at the end of the film the audience is left with the feeling of being cheated
1,there are a few good moments but it is not enough to make this a
1,son and son are the best thing about the
1,this is a very bad film
1,no matter what the movie is supposed to be about
1,anyway the movie was n't so bad that it 's actually funny
1,um the movie is n't a bad film
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have a chance
1,on a positive note the acting was pretty bad
1,a lot more than a few of the other reviewers i 've seen this movie has a very funny scene
1,for a movie that was supposed to have a good plot line it 's a good thing that
1,you can see that this movie is not only the best movie of the decade
1,because the film was shot in a very grainy way
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,this is a movie that i can watch over all
1,kate winslet plays a woman who is married to her husband and is forced to go on a trip to the city to get her husband to go
1,what a waste for a film that is not even worth renting for the dvd collection
1,he is a very talented director
1,too many people have been warned that this movie was made in a
1,only the most ardent fans will be able to appreciate the film
1,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,okay so the movie is n't bad
1,on a positive note the acting was good but i was n't impressed
1,should i say this is a great movie
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,it 's not a movie for the faint of heart
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trying to find a cure to each other
1,because the film was shot on a shoestring day
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low production and i think it was the worst film i have seen
1,the film has a very good cast and it is very well acted and directed and is
1,whatever it was i would n't have to say it 's
1,then there 's the fact it is a film that has been made in the past
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,this is the first movie that i
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i am not going
1,but the film is a bit slow
1,i have to admit that the film was a little too slow for
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget film but i think it was the worst movie i have seen in a very long time
1,further it is a film that is n't afraid
1,until the last 15 minutes of this film i was wondering what the hell was that
1,see this movie and you will see what it is
1,me and my friends are talking about this movie
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but i found the ending quite satisfying and i thought the ending had
1,with the help from his friend the film is not only a very good movie
1,suitably it 's a shame because the
1,or the fact that the movie is a comedy
1,it 's a shame that the movie has been released in dvd format
1,as for the rest i would say that this movie was made for the sake
1,in fact the film is a little too long
1,this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,nevertheless the movie is very good and the acting was excellent and the story line was great and the acting was good but i did n't think it
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,which i think is the most interesting aspect of this movie
1,extra of a few of the characters in the movie were so stupid that i was n't sure
1,there are some good moments but it is n't
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not
1,thanks to a cast that includes a few good performances and
1,this is a very bad movie
1,i was surprised to see that this was a very low budget film but it 's not that bad either
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed
1,well the movie is n't that bad but the acting is n't bad
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't even nominated
1,actually it 's a very good movie
1,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,the film is about the same subject as a book of the same
1,it is a shame because the film was shot in a very small
1,it is a shame that this film is not only
1,but the film is a bit too long
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre
1,but it 's a great film and a good movie
1,there are a lot of things that are wrong with this film
1,why is it that i ca n't even think
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in the community to be a little too concerned
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,but the film is not as good
1,there are a lot of good things to be done
1,that is the only thing i can say
1,just like the first film i was n't
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very dark and dark world of the future
1,with a supposed beard and the size of a hat and a few of his other movies he is a master
1,now i have seen the original version and it is very much like the book but it
1,even though it is a little bit of an action film it
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,nice to know that this is the only movie i 've seen in
1,there are a few good moments in the movie
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,so i was expecting something like this
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and the same story
1,another thing that i did n't like about the movie was the fact it was a movie
1,i have seen the original version of the original and it 's a great movie to watch and i will definitely buy
1,given that this is the only movie that i have ever seen that has been released theatrically in the past decade
1,dudley moore plays the part of a man with a conscience
1,well i guess i was n't expecting much from this film but i did not
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,totally different than the first film and the second
1,not to say the movie is a complete mess but it 's a good movie
1,you know that it is a good movie
1,at the same moment i was a bit skeptical about the film
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,but it is not a movie that you will never see
1,the film has some of the most
1,and it 's not a bad thing
1,it is not a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help thinking it
1,this movie was so bad it 's
1,if i were to give this a 1 i would have to
1,the movie is about a group of young people trying their luck in a small village
1,the movie is about the power of a young man who is a struggling man
1,that 's the way i feel
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but it was a good movie
1,i have seen this movie several years and
1,a lot more than the sum of the parts
1,then the film switches gears from a few moments of the film
1,i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete waste
1,he is the most talented actor of
1,i have seen this film twice
1,mr bean is the best actor in this movie
1,the film is about the same subject as the first film
1,but it is not the best movie i have seen
1,in fact the film is a bit too long
1,while i was n't expecting a lot of it and the movie was a bit slow paced
1,nick stahl plays the role of the young woman who is the only one who has a chance to get her hands on her and
1,first of the film is about the
1,such as a film with a very good plot
1,dont even bother to watch this film
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is a good film
1,still it is n't that bad but it 's not
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,the movie is a bit of an action film but the action scenes were very good
1,i have seen the original movie and it is very good and very good
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,it is a shame that this film has been released theatrically
1,and the movie was so bad that it made
1,the film is about a group that has a very
1,here is a movie where the characters were
1,this is a movie that is not only the
1,the movie is about the same subject as a book
1,i have seen the original movie
1,about a year later he 's the one who is the one who is the father
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was made for the
1,both the actors and the actors are all excellent
1,the film is about the same thing about the man who is a loner
1,otherwise the movie is not a good one
1,shocks and a few others are the same as the
1,from a technical standpoint it is an interesting movie
1,but the movie is a little slow
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't made available on
1,oh and a lot of the movie 's characters
1,you know what to expect and you 'll be able
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and it 's a story
1,allot more than just the same old man with a heart and a sense that he 's a great
1,all the characters are all likable
1,once the film is finished we see the whole family struggle and the family 's relationship
1,but the movie is not a complete
1,the film is a complete waste
1,and the ending is a little unsatisfying and the
1,through the whole film the film has a very interesting and interesting story and the acting was superb and i liked the way the characters developed
1,it is a very good film and it is a shame because it is a very good film and
1,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking for something like a good movie then this is the movie for me
1,this movie was a waste for the whole family
1,the movie was shot on a low budget
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,romantic comedy with the usual suspects and the usual clichs
1,moments of dialogue and dialogue are just a little weak
1,practically every scene in the movie is so bad that it makes it impossible to sit through the entire movie and it is
1,lines like this are not funny
1,the film has a lot of action in the background and the film has a lot of action
1,the film is about a young man named kenny played
1,and it 's a good thing
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie but i did not like the film because it had
1,there is a lot of action and the story is very interesting
1,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite movies
1,blah for a few seconds of the film
1,so the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not
1,this movie was a waste for the first time in my
1,presumably the movie was made for tv
1,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i have seen the movie and i can say that i am a huge fan of the original
1,well the movie was a bit of a mess but i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release in the uk and the movie was made
1,sadly the movie has no real purpose
1,my favorite part is the scene with
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was n't expecting a lot
1,the film has a very good story and a good cast but it
1,so i was n't expecting much
1,another problem with this movie is the fact that the characters were not fleshed
1,unfortunately the film is a little slow
1,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,his performance in the film was so bad that it was hard
1,very good movie and a great film to see
1,it is not the best movie ever made
1,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,she 's not the only one who
1,clara 's father and son are the
1,she 's not a bad guy
1,the film has a lot to offer but the film does n't really have a chance
1,but it 's a great film
1,this movie is a complete waste
1,by the end i was a bit
1,there is a lot of violence and violence
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on video
1,we are supposed for the characters to develop their own motivations and motivations
1,there is no reason for this to be made
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with this movie but i did n't think
1,once the film is finished we see a lot more of the film and the way the story progresses
1,directed by a great actor who is in the movie business and the movie industry is a great actor
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't have a theatrical dvd release
1,this is a very good film
1,and it 's a shame because it 's a great film to watch and
1,we have to be careful of this movie
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting is so bad it
1,if i were to rate this movie a zero it would have made a 0
1,the film has a very good story line
1,with a supposed beard and a beard that 's not a bad thing it 's not even a good movie but it is a good
1,the film is a complete waste
1,and it is not the worst movie i have
1,the film has a lot of action and a few moments of humor
1,but the film is not as good
1,you can tell the story of the
1,after the movie was released the film became a success of
1,later the film is a little bit too long
1,and the ending is so bad that i
1,i was surprised that the film did not have a chance
1,then the film switches gears and we get to the point of the film and then we get
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film
1,the movie is a complete waste of my life
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,there are a lot of things to say
1,it is not the worst film ever made
1,kathy bates plays a woman whose husband is
1,jack lemmon is a fine actor and he 's a good actor
1,if you want to see the movie you will find it a little too slow
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,despite being the first of the series to be a great film it is a great
1,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,the film is about a group that is
1,unlike the first movie the characters were so stupid and so annoying
1,the film is a bit of a bore
1,the film has a lot to offer and is a good example
1,come to you how much you love it and you 're in for something different and
1,we are supposed for the most to see this film and the viewer is not
1,that 's what i got from the film and
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,for a film about a young woman who has a boyfriend who has been cheating for a life of her life
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a good movie
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has been sent into the world of his own family
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,also i think that it is the most beautiful
1,there are a few good scenes in the movie but it is n't enough
1,yeah it 's a little bit of a stretch but it is n't
1,oddly enough it is not a movie
1,besides the acting is n't bad either as a result of a
1,this is a movie that i can recommend to everyone who
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but it 's not
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically in theaters
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are great and i think the director should have done a lot
1,although the movie is not as good as the first film i have n't read the novel so
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has a son and a son
1,the film has some of the most
1,first of all i have to say that this movie was
1,i'm a big big fan of the original
1,william wyler is the master and the
1,from a very young man to a man who
1,another problem with the film is the lack of any shred of character development and
1,morris is a great character actor
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,i'm a fan and have seen a few movies in the past few months but i have seen this one and
1,or maybe it 's the fact that the film
1,alongside a few other movies i 've watched in my lifetime and the ones that have made this one are not
1,if you 're looking for something to watch in a film you should watch this movie
1,nobody is a big part in this
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,neve is a great actress and i
1,we have to be careful of this film
1,they 're all very good and have some
1,the film has a lot to do with a plot that has a few twists but the story is n't that good either
1,so the film is not as bad but the acting and
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,joe don is a very good movie
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
1,all in all this is a very good movie
1,the film has a lot to offer but it is n't
1,cleanliness and love is not a movie for everyone who is not a big fan of hers and the film
1,let 's just hope that you will get a chance to watch this movie
1,some people say that the movie was made in the us and it 's not
1,since i was a kid i was n't really sure whether this was a bad film
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider audience
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the movie but it was very entertaining
1,people who have n't read the book should be aware of this movie
1,some people say that the movie was made in a very low budget and it 's a bit of an insult
1,so i was expecting a good movie
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,overall this is a very bad movie and i would recommend it to any fan of the genre
1,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a great movie to see
1,if i had to watch this movie i 'd have been
1,this movie was so bad that it
1,dixon 's father and his son 's daughter is the daughter of a wealthy family who
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by the film
1,only a few minutes later the film has a lot to offer
1,yes the film was shot on location in the middle east but it was filmed
1,his performance is so good that it is hard to imagine anyone who has seen
1,after a while the movie becomes more like a comedy than an action film
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,there is a scene in which a woman is stabbed
1,and the ending is so stupid and stupid
1,what is the point of this movie
1,so i guess i 'll be a fan of the original series
1,there is a lot to like in the film
1,i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it is one that
1,do not watch this movie if you are
1,nope this is the best of the
1,guess what it 's all about
1,the film has a very good cast and it is a very good movie to see
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so much a little more of a thriller
1,she is the only one to be able to find a way of life
1,these are the only reasons why i
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,you can see the director mateo 's character in the beginning of this film and he 's a very nice guy who
1,amadeus is a very good movie and i think
1,lloyd 's performance is a bit stiff
1,a few of them were good but the story is n't as bad as they could 've
1,the movie is about the power of the human
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release in my dvd collection and it 's a shame that the film is not available
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that it 's
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so bad that you ca n't even make it through the whole thing and
1,consequently the film is a little slow
1,perhaps it was the fact that the movie was shot in the middle of the desert and it was shot in the same way as it did
1,you can tell the story is a bit
1,some people have commented that the movie was made for the first
1,erika eleniak is a very talented actress
1,but it is not the worst film ever
1,my favorite scene is where a man is talking to a woman and says oh god i love him and i love the movie and he
1,these are two of my favorite movies of the last 10 or so
1,the film has some good moments and some good acting
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to me
1,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,as a matter the film is not a complete waste of film
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,as for me it 's a very good film and
1,demme 's direction was a bit slow and i was left wondering why the actors did n't seem like the actors in the movie but they were n't really the actors that
1,little britain has a lot to do
1,this movie is not for the squeamish
1,on a positive note i think the film is a bit
1,and the ending is a little too abrupt
1,the movie is about the power and the
1,as for the acting i think the movie was very bad and i
1,really the movie is n't a complete waste of film and time and time
1,in the end the film is not a complete disaster but it is still worth a
1,that 's the way it is portrayed in the movie and it 's not even
1,hitokiri is a film that is a mustsee for all
1,whoever wrote this script is the only person to be killed
1,i was surprised to see that the film was released in the us
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the evils of the holocaust but i was n't disappointed by the film and the acting
1,it 's a shame because it 's not a
1,really it 's not a movie that is so boring that it is n't funny
1,the film is about the struggle between a man and his son who are not
1,haha i do not know what to say
1,anyone with a modicum memories and a brain can be able
1,how could it be that the movie is a little bit of a mess and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a theatrical release
1,stunning cinematography and a great cast of characters that are all in the film
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money to see this
1,maybe it 's because the movie is so bad it 's good
1,afterward the movie is about the same thing that i have never
1,i'm a big big admirer and this is a movie
1,cue the film as a whole
1,in the first movie he is the one that is n't
1,the film is a complete mess
1,on the other hand the movie is a little slow and boring
1,on a positive note the film has some nice shots and some nice shots of the town and
1,this is the worst film ever
1,of course there is a scene in the movie where the two brothers are walking
1,but it is not the worst film i have ever seen but i 've been a fan of the original and
1,for the most part it is not a bad film
1,unfortunately the film is not a good
1,it is not a film for everyone
1,i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
1,strangely the movie has some very funny moments
1,and it 's a good movie
1,tweety 's character is a bit of
1,well the movie was a bit too long
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have never been so impressed
1,and the movie was a complete mess
1,problem is that the movie is not a good movie
1,occasionally the movie has some good points to it but it 's not
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
1,winkler 's performance is very convincing and the film has a great cast that is very
1,as for me it 's not a bad film but the fact that
1,meg ryan is a great actor
1,it 's not a movie that you will see in a theatre
1,st is a good guy but he is not the one to blame him for
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,all in all this is one that should have had a bigger budget and it
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,intertwined in the first place is a very interesting and very moving film
1,now i know i 've been a little harsh
1,chuck norris is a good actor but his role is so bland that you ca n't help thinking he 's just a bad actor
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,arau is the best of all of the two
1,none the less it is a movie that will
1,that 's what i got from this movie and
1,just like the first film the story is a little
1,truthfully the film has a lot of potential
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy and a great time
1,if i had to watch it again it would be the one that was n't
1,this is a movie for those interested in the genre
1,but the film 's main flaw was
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the story itself was very interesting
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
1,there is no reason to see the movie and it is n't
1,do not watch it for yourself
1,i was surprised that this film was made
1,shots are shot in a way of showing the camera work
1,towards the end of this film the audience was laughing hysterically at how bad the film was
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical release in theaters
1,in the end the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,thankfully the movie has no real plot and is not even worth mentioning that it is a movie that has a few good moments
1,that is the only reason i gave it a 2
1,the film is about the same thing as the first one and the first one was a little slow
1,the movie was shot in a very
1,finally i was n't expecting a lot
1,the movie is about the power of the characters and the relationships that
1,while i do not think that this is a good film i have to
1,he is the most talented actor in this movie and it is a shame he never got
1,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so bad that it
1,i have to admit that i have seen a lot of bad
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see
1,though it is not as bad as it is it is still a good movie to see
1,however the movie was n't so bad that it was just
1,johnny knoxville plays a character who has no idea of what to
1,i have to say that this movie was a waste
1,the film is about a young man who has
1,how could you have to be a fan of this kind of movie
1,but it is not the best movie ever
1,however the movie was n't bad
1,in fact the only thing that makes this film watchable are its ability to make a movie
1,ivan 's father is a very good
1,a lot more of the film is a little bit of
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,my advice is to watch it
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message out of the ordinary
1,it is not the best film i 've seen in my entire life
1,it 's a very good movie and i
1,quote is a film about the evils and tribulations that the
1,only the most ardent fan would be able to see this movie as it was a complete failure to sit
1,his character was so annoying and the acting is horrible and he was just plain awful
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has a crush in his own life and is a very rich person who has
1,like i said the acting is pretty good
1,set on a small budget it 's a very good film and a very enjoyable film
1,and the movie is so bad it makes you wonder how many people have seen this film
1,the film has a very good cast
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre
1,the movie was a waste of time
1,prot is the most powerful character of all
1,for a movie about the evils of war the movie
1,this is the worst film i 've ever had to endure
1,finally i was able into the film
1,from a very young woman to the mother to the maid
1,i was n't impressed with this film
1,well the movie is n't bad
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by this film but i
1,denise richards is the only one that is a good actress and she 's a
1,the movie is a bit of a bore but it is
1,but the film is a little slow and boring

1,could have done without the sex scene and it
1,he 's a very talented director and a very good
1,she 's not the best actress in
1,i have seen the movie twice and it is a
1,you can see the movie in the first place
1,a lot of the scenes were filmed on
1,instead of a good film that is n't
1,he 's not the only one to be in this film
1,the movie was shot on a low level
1,stunningly bad acting and a plot line that is n't really worth watching and is a waste of your time and time to watch
1,visually it 's a very funny movie and it is n't even that bad
1,a lot of the film is about a man named angus and his wife
1,deniro 's performance is the best of the three
1,he is a great actor and a
1,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,that is the only thing that i did n't like
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film that has no plot
1,those who have n't read the book will probably find it hard to believe that the film was made in the early 90 years
1,this is a movie that i can recommend watching
1,the film has some good points and some of them have some good moments
1,there is no reason for the to go into
1,death bed was a great film for the whole cast and
1,it is a shame that this movie has n't been
1,we have to see the movie to get the
1,al adamson 's the howling was one that was a huge success in this
1,a lot more of the film 's characters and more of a story
1,as a matter of view the film has no real redeeming qualities
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film and the third one is n't even
1,the film is about the same thing as the other two

1,if i had n't been in the theater for a few years i 'd have to be the one who would like this

1,the movie is about the power of a young man who has been a struggling
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has a crush on his son and
1,the film has some of its moments but the story line

1,i have to admit that i have seen a lot of bad
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,danila is a very good actor
1,bruce cabot plays a very good guy
1,there are some very funny scenes in the film
1,if you want a good movie with a good plot and good acting this movie
1,dr jacques feinstone is a great director and a very
1,there is no real reason for the characters and the story
1,stevens 's character was a bit too unlikable and too unbelievable to be believable
1,i was surprised to see this film in a theater and i
1,no matter how much you want to watch
1,you can tell that this is a movie that will be a success for anyone interested with a
1,but it is a good film
1,alison is the only person who is a little bit more than the scenerychewing
1,it 's not a bad film but the acting is good
1,as a result the movie is not as bad
1,the film is a bit of a bore
1,your only wish for watching this movie is to see a few more
1,well i do n't know what the point was but i do n't think it 's a good movie to watch
1,what a waste for a movie that
1,for a film that is not a complete failure
1,from a technical standpoint this is a very good movie and a good movie to see
1,and it is not a good film
1,a few years ago the film is a bit dated and the story itself is n't as good
1,blair and mallory are the only ones that can save this movie
1,well i guess it was n't a bad idea to make a movie
1,screen time was a bit of a disappointment but it was n't
1,nevertheless it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a great
1,the movie is about the power of a young man and his wife
1,another problem with this film was that it was n't even nominated for an oscar
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's a great movie to watch

1,not only is the story interesting and it is n't the
1,but the movie is not a good one
1,well the movie is a bit of an action film but the action is n't as bad as the first
1,all in the family and the film 's strengths are to make a movie about a young man who has
1,not to mention the acting is horrible the script is awful and the script is awful and
1,2 out 10 stars for the acting
1,take the time and money for this movie and you will have to watch the movie
1,this movie is a complete mess of a film
1,of all of these films this one has a lot of potential and a good plot line but it 's not
1,many of us have seen the movie and it 's a shame because it is not a movie
1,it is a shame because the film was so good
1,in the first movie the characters are all so real that
1,he 's not a good guy
1,here 's the spoiler the film is a little bit too long for the first hour and it is n't a good movie but it is n't

1,the movie was a waste of time
1,the film is about the struggle between the characters of a young woman who
1,while i was not impressed by this movie i did not like it at
1,somewhere along comes a new one and a very funny ending that i found myself cheering for in a film
1,in fact the film was shot on location and the camera angles were so grainy that it was hard
1,after the first half hour i realized that the film would be good but it was n't that good either
1,make me laugh at my own
1,the movie was a bit slow and the ending was predictable

1,for a movie that was a bit of a letdown it was a very good movie

1,had it not done for the nth anniversary of it i would have been able to suspend my disbelief
1,scott bakula is the only actor in
1,the film is a complete waste
1,if i had n't seen the movie i would have been surprised

1,i was surprised to see that this was the first movie i saw in a long long long

1,this is the first movie that i
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot is so bad it 's hard to follow the plot

1,my advice is to watch this film
1,he is the only person that is able in his own life
1,anyone with an iq for this movie should be advised to see it
1,he 's not the best character in
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight location and the lighting is so bad it makes you wonder what
1,it is a shame that this movie has been released
1,but the movie is a little too slow for the most of the viewer to enjoy and
1,the movie was shot on a low budget
1,dixie is the best actress in the movie
1,then there 's the scene where he 's trying his best friend and his girlfriend to the police and the guy who has the same name as he is in the movie and the scene where she is in a
1,most of them were very good and the movie was very well done
1,beckett is the best character in this film and he 's not just a bad guy
1,the film has a lot to do but the story is n't too bad

1,as for the acting it was n't that good but it 's not that
1,man i was a little confused about the film

1,i was surprised to see this movie in the us
1,lost in translation is a film about the power of
1,a few of them are not so much better than the ones in the movie but the film is a bit too long
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's not just the story of a young
1,it 's a very good film and a good example of how a film should have a good cast and a good script but this is not a movie
1,labor of blood is a film that is not only
1,should n't they be able to get
1,the film has a lot to do but the film does n't
1,you can see the director mateo and the director and his crew
1,in fact the only reason i gave this film 2 out
1,the film has some good points but the rest of

1,it 's a very funny film and a great movie to see
1,you know that it is n't a movie
1,the film has some of the most
1,a lot more than the sum of its time
1,the movie was shot in a very
1,so i guess i 'll be watching this film again and again
1,although the movie was n't a complete disaster it 's still pretty funny
1,it is a very funny film and
1,the movie was shot in the same way that it

1,no one has ever heard of it before
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is not as bad
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown but it was a great film
1,it 's not even the best movie

1,worst movie i have ever seen in my entire time and i have
1,the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
1,no one has ever heard about it

1,there are a few good moments but it is not
1,hackman is a great actor but he is n't a bad actor
1,the movie is about the same thing about a woman named lena

1,one of my favorite movies of all time
1,plot holes were not enough for me to care for the
1,you can see that the actors were trying to
1,how could you have to be a fan to get a movie with a movie that is so bad it is funny to see and hear
1,of all of these movies i have seen this movie and it 's one of
1,my favorite scene was the one where he is walking around in a car and he says he

1,the film has some good points and is a
1,poor direction poor direction poor editing

1,it is not the best film ever but the fact remains that it 's a very good movie
1,i was surprised that this film did not get released theatrically
1,mahmut 's character is a little bit too unlikable and too unbelievable to have a likable character and he does not even come
1,the film has a lot to do but the film does n't
1,the movie is a bit of an action film but it is n't
1,they 're all very good and have a lot to do with the movie and it 's a good movie

1,yesterday the film was made in a time where the story is set up in the same location as the first film and it 's a
1,there is no reason to see this film
1,anyway i have seen a few of them and this
1,it is not the best movie i have seen but i have seen

1,is this a good movie or a
1,i'm a fan and have seen a few movies in my time but this is one that
1,he is the most talented character of the movie and his
1,all the characters were likable and the story line was very good and i
1,we are supposed to be rooting for the hero 's
1,she is the only one who has a crush on her and her
1,lead by the cast and the cast are all fine and the film is a delight to sit through and the acting is excellent and the story line was great
1,whats a little unclear but the movie is a bit slow and
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but the story is so interesting that it 's not even funny enough to be funny and it 's a good movie to see if
1,these are the two adjectives that you 'll never get to know
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt and the
1,a few of the scenes were filmed on a very
1,any of the other actors in this film have a very small
1,i was surprised that the movie did not have a lot of action and the ending was so bad
1,the film is about the same subject matter and the story
1,i'm not sure what the point was but the film is a complete waste
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this film and
1,that 's what makes this movie so great
1,it 's not even the best of the series
1,further it is a very good film
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not a movie that is
1,when i saw the trailer for this film on tv it looked interesting
1,the film is about a group that is
1,matter is a movie about the evils of the human spirit and the struggle to overcome a world of human emotions
1,that is what i think of the
1,if i had to watch this film again i 'd be able to suspend my belief

1,is this the best way to get the movie
1,in the end it 's not a bad movie
1,oh yeah and the ending is so bad
1,i'm a fan of this movie
1,there are a few good scenes in the movie
1,antonio banderas is the perfect choice to be a
1,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,it is a very funny film
1,it is a shame because the film is so good
1,there is no real reason for the existence to be answered
1,john goodman is the perfect actor for this movie
1,i have to say that i was very impressed by the movie and the acting was
1,anybody interested with the film will find it difficult for the audience to enjoy it as a comedy and a comedy as a comedy
1,it 's not even the best movie
1,michelle pfeiffer plays the mother of a wealthy mother who has
1,the movie was shot on a budget that would make a movie a little more interesting to see
1,with the help of the two leads the two leads have a very good chemistry and the chemistry between each other is very believable and the chemistry between them is palpable and
1,first of all i was a little confused about this film and it 's not even worth mentioning
1,one of the most memorable films i have seen in a while and it is a very
1,do not waste my time on it
1,oh yeah and i did n't care about
1,also i think that it is the best movie
1,unfortunately the movie is n't as good as it should
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff you will probably like it
1,clincher the movie was shot in a very cheap way
1,i was surprised that the movie was made in the early 90
1,robert englund was a great choice to show us the world
1,anyway the movie is n't a complete mess but the fact is it is n't a good
1,the film is about a group that has a very
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,chris kattan is the only one who has the ability to pull off
1,this movie was a waste of time
1,the film has a very good story line and a good cast but
1,when i first saw this movie i was very impressed
1,i have seen this film twice and i still have nightmares
1,rich and beautiful is the story of the life of an old man who has a
1,as a result the film is a complete waste
1,but the movie was a bit of a disappointment and i did not care about any character development or
1,all the actors were great and the movie is a real pleasure
1,you can see the director mateo 's vision of his work
1,this movie is a must for all fans
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,obviously the movie is n't as bad but the script is so bad that you ca only laugh at it
1,i have seen the movie and i have to admit that i have seen the original version
1,i was surprised to see that this was a very good
1,supposedly the film was a little too much to be enjoyed
1,although the film is not a masterpiece it is a very enjoyable movie and a great one at
1,afterward the film is a little slow and the ending is a bit
1,then there 's the fact it 's a movie that has been made to
1,okay i have to say i was impressed with this movie
1,this movie is not a good one but the fact
1,i have to admit that the film was very well made and the acting was good
1,however the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,why is this film so awful
1,for a film about the evils and the struggle of a young woman to be the most powerful and powerful woman in history
1,the film is about the same thing about the same old man who has been killed in a war in
1,i have seen the original movie
1,the film is about a group of people and
1,zombie is a very good film and i hope
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i was n't impressed
1,overall this is a great film and i recommend it to all who like the original and
1,for a film that was a bit of an action film i was expecting something more
1,too bad the movie is n't so bad it is good it is not even bad enough to
1,it is a shame that this movie has been released
1,if you 're looking for something that 's not a good idea to watch it
1,maybe the director was trying too hard
1,we are supposed to believe the story of
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,as a matter of fact i was n't sure whether it would be a good movie or two
1,silly characters are not enough to save
1,a lot more than a few of those films are
1,in fact the only reason why i gave this film 2 out of ten was because it was a little too
1,should i be able for a movie to get
1,surprisingly enough it is not a film for everyone who
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that it is
1,pretty soon the movie becomes more of a drama than the first one
1,it 's not even the best movie

1,if i were to rate this film a 1 i would

1,i have to say i was very impressed by the movie and the acting was good
1,as for the rest of the movie it is a little too
1,practically all of them are just as good and as a whole lot of fun
1,in the end it is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone
1,it 's not even a movie it
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,instead it is an excellent movie that is a joy for anyone who enjoys a good film

1,this movie was a waste of my time
1,i have seen this film several times and it 's one that i would
1,it 's not a movie for the masses

1,think of it as the worst movie i have seen
1,he 's a great actor but he 's not a good actor
1,those who are n't in the mood of this film are not sure who to believe
1,from the beginning of the movie the movie is a bit slow and the story line is very predictable and the acting is horrible but the story is so bad it 's unbelievable
1,john wayne is a great director
1,but the film 's main flaw is the fact that it is not

1,on the plus side the acting is very good
1,after the movie i thought that it was a good idea to make it a movie to

1,but the movie is a bit too slow for me and the story line
1,every time he 's on the show
1,the movie was a waste of my time and i would have been better spent on a rental
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,also the film has some of its moments
1,a lot more of the same is true of this movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
1,it is not a film for everyone
1,maybe the movie was made for tv but it is n't
1,i was n't impressed with the film

1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great movie to see
1,the movie is about the same subject matter as the book and
1,avery 's direction is a bit too
1,this movie is a must for anyone interested with the genre
1,it is not a movie that you
1,now i have seen a lot worse movies and this one was a lot better
1,shinae is a very good actress and she 's a great
1,so the movie was made in the first half of a
1,dvd purchase is the only thing that i have to
1,whether or not you can find a movie that is so good you can tell that it 's
1,sure it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a great film to see
1,what a great movie this was
1,yet the movie is a complete mess of
1,beyond the fact that it is a film
1,commander 's wife is a great movie
1,and the ending is a bit too abrupt
1,animated movie is a great example
1,the film has some of its most
1,same goes with it 's a wonderful movie
1,this is a very good film
1,accidentally the movie starts with the two main characters stumbling through the desert and then they are forced to go to
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad it is n't even worth the money
1,here 's the spoiler i have to admit i did n't like the movie but i was very impressed
1,the movie was shot in a small budget and the actors
1,powerful and interesting the film has a
1,in fact the film was shot on location and the editing is very
1,even the actors are not very convincing and they are not believable in their roles
1,i have to say that this movie was a complete waste of time and money
1,early in his career he is the one to be reckoned with and he is the only person in the movie that is not a very good one

1,whether or what to do and what it is
1,nobody seems to have a clue about what happened to the

1,ok i have seen this film and i can only say that it
1,the film is about a group that is
1,and the ending is so stupid that
1,the film has a very good story line and the
1,for the first half of this film the audience is left wondering why they are n't
1,not only is the acting terrible but it 's a great performance and i
1,another thing that is good is that it 's a very good film
1,dum 's character was so annoying that it was impossible to understand why the

1,i have to say that this is a great movie and it 's
1,it is a very funny film and
1,mitchell is the best of all
1,however i was surprised that this film was made in the early 1990s
1,the film is a bit of an action film but it is a good film
1,how can a film like this get a dvd of the dvd release
1,a lot more than a little more of the action sequences are the same as in this movie

1,she 's not a good person but she 's a great actress and is very good in this movie
1,not only does he not make it to his wife 's house but the fact is that the film has been made by a group of friends and
1,the movie was shot on a low level of the budget
1,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,the film is a complete mess of the first movie
1,and it 's a good thing

1,i have seen this movie twice

1,in the end the movie has a lot of action and a good story
1,kevin spacey plays the role of a very good guy
1,each character is the same person that they are
1,respect for the actors who are the only ones who have ever seen a movie that is
1,apparently this is a film for the whole generation of people who have n't read the book and seen it as the first movie i have seen
1,however the movie is not a complete waste of film and it is not worth it to see it again and
1,reluctantly the film begins with the arrival from the beginning to the end

1,granted it 's not a good movie but the acting and the acting are all good and it is
1,the film is about the struggle between a group and the two of the three
1,brett is the best of the three
1,also the movie was shot in the same location
1,the film is a complete waste

1,and the movie is so bad it 's funny
1,angelopoulos is a master of his craft

1,successful and the best thing about the movie was
1,beating up a couple and a few
1,i have seen the movie twice and it is a
1,it 's a very good film
1,then the film is over and you get the feeling that the film makers were trying to be a bit too hard
1,it is not the worst film i have ever had to watch

1,when i saw this film i was very impressed
1,it 's not a bad film
1,then there is the fact that it 's not the same as the first one but the second half

1,you can see that this movie is a complete
1,the movie is about the same thing about the same people that made the movie
1,despite being the first movie i 've ever heard that i have n't seen the original i
1,we are supposed for a film that will be remembered as a comedy but it is

1,swift 's direction was very good
1,the film has some of the worst acting i 've
1,i have to admit that the movie was very well done
1,and it 's not a bad movie

1,now that 's a bit of a stretch to say
1,i have to say i did not like this movie
1,however the movie was a bit slow and the
1,far more entertaining than the original the film is very well done and the
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be so boring
1,the film has some good moments but it is not a movie
1,thanksgiving is the best movie i have seen
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message out
1,there are some good moments but it 's not enough
1,the movie is about the power and the
1,charles grodin is the perfect actor
1,then the film switches gears from a very interesting premise to a very
1,i have to admit i was very disappointed
1,of all the films i have seen this
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be so boring
1,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,its a shame that this movie is not only a film
1,the film has a very good cast
1,but the film 's main flaw is that it is n't a comedy or
1,the movie is about the power and the
1,is it the same way that the movie was filmed
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching
1,i was n't expecting much of a movie to be

1,the movie is a complete mess of a film
1,knowing that it 's not the best movie ever made but

1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,paul rudd plays the part of the movie with the character and his character is a little bit of
1,i have to say that this is one that i would n't have
1,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman who is a woman
1,of all of these films i have to say i 've never seen a worse
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't have a chance for
1,while the film is a bit slow it 's not as bad
1,one thing i liked was that it had the same
1,although i do not know what the director is thinking of the movie it is not
1,there are a lot of good movies out there
1,charlton jovi plays the part with the character and he 's a good actor but he 's not a good guy he 's just not good
1,i have seen this film twice
1,while i was n't impressed by the film 's overall intentions i was expecting something more from a film
1,now that i have n't seen it in a theater it 's a great
1,on a positive note the acting is pretty good and it is a good film to watch
1,my favorite scene was when the guy in a bar and a girl walks around a tree and then suddenly gets hit
1,while i was not impressed by the film i found myself wishing to see a more accurate portrayal of a woman who was a little more than a child in a mental hospital and was
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed in a studio studio
1,when the movie is over and the acting and directing are the worst you
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the film
1,the film has a lot to do but the film does n't
1,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,the movie is about a young woman named caroline played by the beautiful actress gabrielle who has a crush in
1,i was n't expecting much of a film to be
1,he is a very talented director and i hope that
1,it is not the best film ever but the fact that it is a film about a young man 's struggle with his wife and his son
1,still it 's a great film and a great one
1,this movie is not a good one
1,it 's not even the worst movie ever made but it 's not bad
1,i was surprised to find out that the film is
1,after a few minutes of watching this film you will be wondering why
1,perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie was the fact that the characters were not fleshed in the same manner
1,no one has to be a good guy to watch this movie
1,the movie was shot in a very
1,different than that in this movie it 's not even that
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this film and i have seen it several many more times and it still has
1,have you seen the original version of the original
1,by far the best thing i can do to get to see the movie
1,s character development and the story is so predictable and so contrived it 's hard to follow
1,this is the first film that i have seen in a long long
1,still the movie is n't as good as the first one
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film
1,considering the fact that it was a low production budget and the acting
1,any movie that has a plot line is a bit of a joke
1,indeed the film has a very good cast
1,she 's a very talented woman and a very
1,every time i see it it is like a tv movie
1,as for the rest of the movie i was expecting
1,sometimes the film has a few moments of suspense but it is not
1,mclaglen is a fine actor but he does n't have much else to work with
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not only available on video
1,errol is the only person who has a shred of decency and he is not a very good actor
1,and the movie is so bad that i could n't even watch
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in a time
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that it is
1,so the film is a little slow but the story is very interesting
1,leading lady is the epitome of a good actress who has a lot of screen presence and she 's a great actress
1,this is a movie for those interested with
1,when i saw this film i was very excited
1,to be honest the movie was a bit too
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,the film has a very interesting plot but the story itself was
1,well the movie is n't bad but the story is n't bad
1,and it is not the worst film ever made
1,perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was that it was a complete
1,i was surprised that the film did not have the same effect on the same subject matter
1,here is a movie where the story is told in a very simple manner and it 's a very simple one
1,from the opening sequence to a final showdown in which the
1,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically in the us and it was
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and i think that the director was trying to be a little
1,the film has some of its moments but it 's
1,maybe it 's because the movie is a little too much to ask
1,in fact it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen by many
1,but it 's not a good movie and it is n't
1,it 's not even the best movie
1,all in all this is a great
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood film
1,how could you have to be kidding that
1,the film has some good moments but the rest of the film just does not work
1,everything is illuminated and the film has
1,but the film is not as bad as the first one but it is n't as good as the first
1,his performance in the film was so good that it was almost impossible for me to believe he had
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that it 's not
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,when the movie was over i was so excited to have seen it i was so excited that it was n't released
1,a lot more of the same
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this film
1,the film has a lot of action and a lot of fun to watch
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to begin
1,sandra bernhard is the only one that is good in her part and
1,you can see the movie in a different way than most of its contemporaries
1,the movie is a bit slow but the acting and the story are so bad it 's almost impossible to believe that the director was trying to make a
1,lois chiles is a good actor
1,without a shadow the worst film ever
1,almost every character in this movie was a complete idiot who was n't even remotely funny
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends and i were watching the whole thing and i did n't even care about it
1,i was surprised that the film was n't released in the uk
1,i have to say i did not enjoy the film
1,if you 're a fan of horror movies and have seen a lot more than you
1,starring the always dependable ashley carroll who plays a woman who has to deal to save
1,finally the film 's main protagonist 's daughter is killed and the daughter of
1,of course there is no real reason to watch this movie unless it 's not for
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film
1,i was surprised to see this movie in the us
1,her character was a bit too much to bear
1,she is a very talented woman and she 's not a good actress but she is a great actress and she 's not a bad actress but she does n't have a good
1,let 's face it the characters were n't so bad
1,i have to say i was very impressed with the movie and i was surprised to find
1,ultimately it 's not the best movie i have seen but it is a good one to
1,if i had to give this movie a 1 out 10 it would have been so bad it would be
1,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,cruel and depressing is the story about the power
1,of course there are a lot of good movies but this is the worst
1,the movie is about a group that is attacked and tortured by the death of a man who is a witch
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad as it 's a waste of money
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,the film is a complete waste
1,those are the only reasons why this film has been made by a wide margin and is a must for fans of the original and a fan of classic
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and i do not know why i watched this movie so many times i
1,not to say the film was bad
1,here is the plot the acting and directing are all very good and the story line
1,grant is a great actor but he is n't a good director and it is n't that bad
1,now that 's the only reason why this film was so bad
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had to endure and it 's not worth
1,well the movie is n't bad
1,being a fan of this movie i was expecting a lot of the same
1,i have to admit that the film is very good
1,because of the fact it was a long way the film was shot in the middle
1,theres a lot more of the same characters in
1,death wish was the worst movie ever made
1,jack lemmon is a fine director and a good director
1,yeah i do concede that the film was made for tv but it 's not a movie
1,at least it was a bit of an attempt at a comedy
1,my favorite part of the film was the ending
1,sidney poitier is a fine director and the director of the film
1,stunningly bad acting and a bad plot line make this a very enjoyable movie
1,patricia arquette is the perfect choice to play a character
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,but the movie is a little slow
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,yet it is not the worst film ever
1,one thing that really bothered my nerves was that the movie had no
1,all in the name is the best of the bunch
1,the film has a lot of potential and the cast are excellent
1,as for the acting i would have liked to have
1,typically it is not a bad movie
1,the film is about a group of people who have a relationship together and are
1,all in the name is the best
1,we are not supposed to be scared by the fact of the story but it 's a very good movie
1,good acting and a great cast
1,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but it is definitely worth watching
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,it is not the worst film i 've ever had the misfortune to watch
1,audiences who have n't seen the original film will find this
1,it 's not a movie that you can watch
1,then the film switches to the final scene of the film and then the final shot of a man walking around in a chair
1,all in the name of the movie
1,rimmer is the best movie i have ever seen and i 've seen it twice
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact it 's not even
1,keanu goldberg is the only one in the film that has a very funny cameo
1,the movie is about a group that has a lot to do and the story is told by the characters
1,as for me it 's not that i have n't
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trying their
1,a few of the actors are very well done and i think that the
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it is not a good film
1,not only is the acting terrible but the story line and the performances are all excellent
1,look at it objectively and you 'll be able to suspend disbelief for the next
1,recently i was a bit skeptical about this
1,the movie was a waste of time
1,the film has some good moments and some nice touches but it is not
1,he is a very talented actor
1,sorry to be fair but it is n't a good movie
1,we are supposed to believe the director is a genius and the
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's a shame that it is not a
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,good acting great story great actors
1,tanguy 's character is so stupid and so annoying that i could n't even care about the character
1,strong characters and situations are present
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get a grip but i did
1,it is not a movie that you
1,right now the film is a little too long for the first half of it
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and it 's not even that good to watch
1,frederick is a very good character actor
1,christopher walken is the only one that is good in this movie and it is n't even his performance
1,sudden impact is the first film that has a very low rating
1,let me tell the same story
1,but the movie is not as bad
1,do n't worry about the movie because it is
1,i have to admit that the film was very good
1,it is a very funny film
1,when i first heard about it it 's not even a good movie
1,save your money rent this film
1,maybe the director was n't trying too hard
1,can i say that the movie was so good
1,one thing i did like was that the movie is a bit too long for the first hour
1,the film has a very interesting story and a very good story
1,for a film about the holocaust of a young man who has a very difficult time dealing with the loss he is trying and finding
1,this is the first movie i 've
1,and it 's a good movie to watch
1,the movie was a waste for the whole movie and i think it 's a shame that it was n't released in the uk
1,one of my favorites was the first time that i was in the theater and i was so bored
1,it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
1,practically every scene is a complete mess of a movie
1,an interesting premise for a movie is the acting
1,it 's a very good film
1,it 's not a movie that you will see but you will be
1,we are not supposed to feel sorry for him and
1,also the movie is not as good
1,it 's not a movie for the masses
1,until the end i thought it would be interesting to see the ending of this film
1,congratulations to the director for making this movie and the director and writer of this film should have been proud
1,to be fair i was n't impressed by the movie
1,and it is a shame because the movie is so bad that it 's hard not only for the
1,there are some good scenes and the movie has a lot of
1,55 years ago the movie is about a group
1,however the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable to be believable
1,last year 's eve was released in 1995 and the first film was a great success for
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,this movie was a complete waste of time
1,if i were n't for the movie 's shortcomings it was the best of all of the above
1,those are the things that make it a great movie and i think it is one of the best movies ever made
1,the movie was a waste of my life and my life and i would n't have
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish watching it and i was so bored
1,it 's a very funny film and a good
1,quick to say that this movie is a complete waste of time
1,well i do not think this is a good film but i do not think it
1,note that it 's not the best movie i 've ever watched but i 've seen better acting in the elementary school
1,i have to admit that the movie is very good
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,but the movie is a little slow
1,however i do n't think that this is a good movie
1,much like the movie the plot is very simple
1,wenders 's direction was a little choppy and the film is n't as
1,and the ending is a little too long for me to be surprised by this movie
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's not a good movie
1,paz kotto is a good actor but his performance in the film was so poor
1,likewise it is a very good film and
1,i was n't impressed with this film
1,perkins is the best in this film
1,if you want a good laugh out of the film you 'll enjoy it but i do not think it
1,his character is a little too cocky and the movie
1,this movie is a must for all fans of a good movie
1,you know what i was going through the whole movie
1,and it is not a good movie to watch but
1,then there 's a few scenes of the movie that are so bad that you wonder why the
1,we are supposed for the most part
1,note the fact that the film is set in the future of the 19th centuries
1,i have seen the movie and i can say it 's not the worst movie ever made but i
1,first of the movie 's title is a little too long for me
1,i have seen the original version of this movie
1,i have to admit that the film is a bit too slow and the ending was just too predictable
1,sorry to say that this is a great film
1,in the end the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,as a matter of fact i was not surprised to see that this movie was a complete flop of
1,some people have said this is the best movie i have ever seen and
1,maybe it 's just a matter of time before the movie was
1,russell 's character was a bit too much for him
1,in the end the film is a very interesting and moving film
1,see it if you have a chance
1,like i mentioned earlier that the movie was a little too long for
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,in the first movie the characters were very believable
1,admittedly the movie was a bit slow but the story is so good and the characters
1,he is a great actor and he is a great actor and is very believable
1,the film is about the struggle of a young woman to be a woman in
1,major spoilers the film has some nice twists but it is n't
1,i have seen the movie and i have to admit that it is a very good film and i recommend this film
1,i was surprised to find out that this was a low budget film but i think that the actors were good enough
1,this is a very good movie
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves a good movie
1,i have seen the movie and it 's a shame because i
1,it is a very funny movie
1,two of the best movies of the year and one of the most underrated movies of the year and a great film for those of
1,you can tell that this is the only movie that has been
1,and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,my advice to anyone interested in this movie is that you do not want a movie that you will enjoy
1,cuba is a very good film and i hope that the director and director will rerelease a movie that will make you think
1,the film is a complete mess
1,first off the acting is terrible and i have no idea why the director was so impressed by
1,even the most ardent of the characters in the movie were the same as they did
1,fun to see the film is about a group that has
1,or the other one is that it 's not a good movie
1,after the movie was over i had a
1,i have seen the movie and i can say it is a great movie
1,it is a very good film and i recommend
1,but the movie was a little slow
1,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,this is a very bad film and i do n't know what to say about it
1,if you want to see the worst movie ever put in a film this one is n't
1,duane 's character was so stupid and stupid that i was laughing at him
1,this is the worst movie ever
1,a few years later i saw the film and was surprised to see
1,but the movie is not a complete
1,yes it is a little bit too long but
1,he 's not the only actor in
1,back in the early 1980s i was a little confused at first but the film is still
1,if you want a good movie with good actors and a great plot this one will make your head hurt and you will be
1,it is not a movie for the
1,dame helen mirren is a great actress and she is very convincing
1,i was n't expecting much from this
1,if i had n't seen the original version of the movie i 'd have been surprised
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,for a movie that was supposed to have a plot line it could have made a good film
1,too bad the movie is so bad that it 's almost unbearable
1,guy ritchie 's character is so bad that you ca n't help thinking that he is a good actor
1,the film has some good points but it is n't
1,maybe the director was n't going for a much needed plot but the acting was
1,granted the movie is a bit slow
1,so i was n't expecting a movie to be a good movie but it is n't that bad either
1,staying away and watch a movie
1,on the other hand i have a feeling that this
1,secondly the movie was a little too long for
1,on a positive note the acting is pretty good
1,as for me it was a very enjoyable movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and it is a
1,films are not always a bad thing but this is a good
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,a lot more than the usual suspects of the film the film has some of its moments
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on dvd or vhs release
1,this movie was so bad that it
1,but it is not the worst film i have seen in my life
1,this is the first film that i have seen that
1,aspects are very good and the acting was
1,the movie is a bit of an insult to the viewer
1,outside the house of the two sisters and the two men in the
1,according one of the most popular films i 've seen this is the first one i 've seen in
1,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,off course the film is a bit of an oddity but the story is a little bit
1,ace is the best of the three
1,if i were to rate this movie lower then the rating it deserves
1,at least the film is a little too much
1,i have to say that this movie was a waste
1,of course there is a lot more of a story than the usual suspects
1,still the film is a little too slow for the most part
1,instead it 's just a bunch of boring characters
1,nestor is a great character actor who has a great deal of charisma
1,of all the movies i 've seen i 've seen this one and it is
1,i was n't expecting much of a film to be
1,in fact the only thing that makes it worthwhile are the scenes where the two guys get together
1,the film has some good points and some of them have a good
1,and the ending was so stupid that it
1,there is a scene in the film that is a little bit too much for the viewer to handle
1,the movie is a bit of an action movie
1,whomever is responsible for the film is the most important and important thing to come across as a film
1,this is a very bad movie
1,the film has a very good story and a good story line
1,the film is a bit slow but the acting is excellent
1,everyone is entitled to the fact they are trying to make a movie
1,why is it that i do not know what the director was trying to convey
1,i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie since i was so young and i was so impressed
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't believe that i wasted 2 hours of your time
1,the film is about a young man who is a teenager who has a heart attack and a love affair with his mother
1,they 're not even close enough to make the movie even remotely watchable
1,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,the film is about the struggle between a man who has a life
1,also the film has a very interesting plot and a good story
1,helene 's performance is a little too weak
1,is it a comedy or a comedy
1,it 's not even a good film
1,it 's not a bad film but it is a great
1,it is a shame because the film was shot in a very grainy manner
1,when the film is released it is a film about the life of the legendary and the revolutionary
1,this is a very bad film
1,the movie was a waste for me and my gf and my sister were watching
1,i was surprised to see this film
1,this movie is not for the faint of stomach but if your looking to see a movie with a
1,the film has some good moments and the acting was good but the story line
1,but the movie is not as bad
1,i was surprised to find that this was the worst film i have ever seen
1,garish is a very good film and it is
1,the film has a lot to offer but the film is a little slow
1,it 's a very funny film
1,does anyone know where i could get a copy
1,apparently this movie is a complete waste
1,obnoxious and stupid and not even worth the time
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's not even that bad it was
1,wow i do n't know what to do
1,meanwhile the film 's director is the director and director of the movie and the film
1,summarily it 's a movie that has a lot of action and some of it is a little slow but it 's a bit too slow and too predictable for me
1,the film has a very good cast
1,do not watch this film if your a fan of hers
1,she is the only one to get her out of the house and she 's not a big fan
1,why did they have to make a movie that is n't
1,it 's not even a movie
1,them all are the only ones that can be blamed for the movie
1,i was surprised that this movie did not have a chance to redeem it for the sake that the movie
1,not only does he not make it to the screen but it 's a very nice film
1,do n't waste time on this one unless your looking to see it
1,i'm a fan of this movie
1,but the film is not a good one
1,on a positive note the acting is pretty bad
1,so the film is not as good as the
1,shot on location and in a small budget
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so much more of an action movie
1,ordinarily i do not think that this is a great movie
1,this movie was so awful that it
1,i have seen this film twice and i have never been so disgusted by the
1,you can tell the story is a joke
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit too long
1,it 's a shame because it 's a very bad film and it
1,what is this film trying to say
1,if you 're looking to see a good movie about the evils of the vietnam war you will find that
1,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted but it 's not a bad movie
1,one of the most interesting things in the movie is that the characters were
1,as a matter the movie was made for the sake that the film was made in the first
1,i have to say that this movie was so
1,we are supposed for a movie to be so boring that it 's
1,in the end it 's not a bad movie but it 's not bad either
1,perhaps it was a mistake for the filmmakers and producers to make it a little more entertaining and more entertaining than it
1,the movie was shot on location and the camera
1,here 's the spoiler i was n't expecting much
1,but it is not a movie
1,as for the acting i would say that this movie is not a good one
1,michael caine is the perfect choice to be the hero of the movie and he 's a great director
1,he is a great director and he 's not just the
1,the film is about a group of young men in the
1,if i had n't been a fan i would have had the opportunity
1,and the ending was so stupid
1,never mind the fact it is n't a movie
1,keep it in mind that it is a good film
1,this is the worst film ever
1,at least it 's a little too much to ask for
1,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,oh and the music is a bit too
1,your average viewer is a little too old for this film
1,fortunately it 's a little too long
1,if you want a good laugh out loud funny film
1,the film is a bit of a mess
1,give me a copy of the movie and i will
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,and the movie is so boring
1,210 i mean the movie is a
1,its a shame because the film is so bad that i ca
1,it is a shame that this film is n't released theatrically on
1,it 's a very funny film and a great movie to see
1,despondent and a lot of people have been killed
1,petrie 's character is so annoying and the plot
1,the film is about a young woman named
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,i have seen the movie and it is one that i
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the lack of any real plot
1,not only does he have a good time but he is also very good in the movie
1,when i saw the movie on the dvd cover it was very good
1,the film has a very good story line
1,the film has a lot of action in it and the ending was pretty cool but
1,thanks for a few laughs and the occasional laughs that make it a little more enjoyable
1,as for the acting it was a bit too stiff
1,this movie was a waste for the whole family and it 's
1,the film is a complete mess
1,not only is the story interesting but it 's a
1,this movie was so bad it 's
1,yes it 's a bit of an action movie
1,well the movie was a little too much for the first hour and
1,the film has some good moments and the acting is pretty good
1,that 's the only reason why i gave this film 2 stars out of ten stars for it 's
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted
1,michael caine plays a very good role in the movie and is the perfect choice for the role of a man
1,once again the film is a little too much for me
1,patrick warburton is a great actor and he
